  CHAPTER 9  The Distinctiveness of the Society of Jesus’s Mission in Pedro de Ribadeneyra’s Historia ecclesiastica del schisma del reyno de Inglaterra (1588) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Weinreich Spencer J.<br>
  Abstract: “Two more private and particular considerations encouraged me in the work. The first, that I am a Spaniard; the second, that I am a priest of the Society of Jesus.”¹ Such was the explanation offered by the priest and scholar Pedro de Ribadeneyra (1526–1611) for the production of the
                  Historia eclesiastica del scisma del reyno de Inglaterra(henceforth, the “Historia”), his polemical account of the English Reformation. Troublingly, virtually all scholarship on theHistoriahas concentrated on the former factor, to the detriment of our appreciation of the latter.

  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Conspiracy, the secret cooperation for the achievement of some base design, has been a frequently recurring topic of political discussions since ancient times. But it has been the turbulent history of the United States that has provided the most fertile ground for conspiracy discourse. From the time of the Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse—that is, linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy—has pervaded diverse forums and genres of American political discourse. For many critics and commentators, the ubiquity of conspiracy theories in American history and the increasing appeal of<br>

  Book Title: Invoking the Invisible Hand-Social Security and the Privatization Debates<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Medhurst Martin J.<br>
  Abstract: In Invoking the InvisibleHand Robert Asen scrutinizes contemporary debates over proposals to privatize Social Security. Asen argues that a rights-based rhetoric employed by Social Security's original supporters enabled advocates of privatization to align their proposals with the widely held belief that Social Security functions simply as a return on a worker's contributions and that it is not, in fact, a social insurance program.By analyzing major debates over a preeminent American institution, Asen reveals the ways in which language is deployed to identify problems for public policy, craft policy solutions, and promote policies to the populace. He shows how debate participants seek to create favorable contexts for their preferred policies and how they connect these policies to idealized images of the nation.<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: The conduct of international relations has always involved skillful use of persuasive discourse. Relations between states might depend on factors such as military capability and natural resources, but the decisions made about the conduct of peace and war are also a result of the successes, failures, habits, and nuances of persuasive appeal among elites and publics alike. For the most part, however, academic research in international relations has not focused on the forms and effects of conversations, speeches, debates, narratives, or discourses in political practice. This systematic inattention to the role of words in foreign affairs is the result of<br>

  Author(s) L.Ivie Robert<br>
  Abstract: Fear is a feature of human nature that political realists typically factor into their pessimistic view of international affairs. The world as it actually “is,” they assume, consists of nation-states inherently conflicted over competing interests and limited resources, arbitrating their differences and seeking security through the elusive agency of power. Humankind is motivated less by morality and law than by fear and greed, motives which must be managed through the intelligent application of power—not just military power, but economic and ideological might as well. Providing for national security and fulfilling national interests are constant aspirations and tenuous achievements in<br>

  Abstract: At the Yalta Conference, in February 1945, Roosevelt and Stalin briefly discussed Indochina and the role that the French should play therein after the world war ended. During their colloquy, “the President said that the Indochinese were people of small stature, like the Javanese and Burmese, and were not warlike.”¹ Five years later, Roosevelt’s successor approved an official policy statement in which those Indochinese fighting against the French were described as “a determined adversary who manufactures effective arms locally ... and who was, and is able, to disrupt and harass almost any area within Vietnam ... at will.”² In the<br>

  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Abstract: A lexis de Tocqueville recalled reading a news story during his visit to the United States in the 1830s about a court in New York where a witness declared that he did not believe in the existence of God or the immortality of the soul. As a result of the witnessʹs confession, the judge refused ʺto accept his oath, given, he said, that the witness had destroyed in advance all the faith that could have been put in his words.ʺ Apparently astonished by the story, Tocqueville added to his report the fact that the newspaper offered no commentary about the<br>

It would not be difficult to multiply logarithmically these critiques of Christianity.

  Author(s) CAMBON GLAUCO<br>
  Abstract: When Mario Sansone stated that Canto XXVII functions as a narrative pause between two climactic sequences (the rise through the three richly populated last cornices of the purgatorial mountain and the meeting with Matilda and Beatrice in the Terrestrial Paradise), he certainly did not mean to reduce Canto XXVII to merely a link lacking a poetical strength of its own. In fact, Sansone has added that the pauselike quality or narrative suspension following the poignant voice of Arnaut Daniel in the refining fire and foreshadowing the apparition of Matilda in the place of perennial springtime is counterpointed by an “ascending<br>

  Abstract: When the scholar Hemacandra completed his grammar and presented it to King Jayasiṃha Siddharāja of Gujarat, the king had the book copied and distributed throughout the world—a world that was vast yet delimited in its vastness and completely named and known. The fact that a cosmopolitan grammar should have escaped its local confines in Aṇahilapāṭaka and circulated as far north as Nepal and as far south as Cōḻa country is in itself hardly surprising. After all, Sanskrit, like Prakrit and Apabhramsha (which are also analyzed in Hemacandra’s grammar), was no language of Place and was quite capable of traveling<br>

                  Oxford History of Medieval Europe, while observing that a major factor in “the new diversity” that marked the late Middle Ages was “the exploitation of a variety of languages in important writings,” confesses himself at a loss to explain the development itself; the origins of the vernacular turn are for him as “mysterious” as its results are<br>

  Abstract: If the passing of the so-called master narratives that have shaped modern ways of knowing the world—accounts based on belief in the progress of scientific reason, for example, or human emancipation—is partly a result of discontent with their apparent claims to a monopoly on truth or their rigid laws of developmentalism, there is no little irony in the fact that they are being replaced, in some instances, by what might be called cultural naturalism as the explanatory model of change in the history of culture and power. To be sure, theories linking cultural change and biological evolution have<br>

  Abstract: Few things seem as natural as the multiplicity of vernacular languages used for making sense of life through texts—that is, for making literature. And few things seem as unnatural as their gradual disappearance in the present, especially from the pressures exerted by globalizing English. Literary-language loss is in fact often viewed as part of a more general reduction of diversity in a cultural ecosystem, a loss considered as dangerous as the reduction of biological diversity, to which—in another instance of cultural naturalization—it is often compared. Today’s homogenization of culture, of which language loss is one aspect, seems<br>

  Abstract: Richard Posner lists several reasons to think that morality and law are enterprises distinct from literature: the fact that the heinous actions of German lawyers and citizens in the 1930s and 1940s coexisted with Germany’s status as one of the most cultured nations of the world; the circumstance that one of the well-known abilities of many well-read people is to remain insensitive to the suffering of others; the fact that moral atrocities fill the literary canon without affecting either the aesthetic virtues of the work or its reader’s own moral attitudes; and, finally, the distance between the concerns of law<br>

Over the decades, this book has stimulated philosophical discussion in Germany as no other. Its career is not so much owing to its manifestly hostile stance toward the human sciences, which misunderstand their “understanding” as method; rather, its success can be explained by the relevance of one basic question that Gadamer’s hermeneutics seeks to answer.

  Abstract: By 1920, modern historical thought had reached a certain point of maturity. My aim in this chapter is to explain this process. With improved accessibility to new types of knowledge and completely new forms of intellectual organization, the perceptual tools of educated people were modified, at first quite slowly, but by 1919, quite decisively. Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Book Title: Cannibal Talk-The Man-Eating Myth and Human Sacrifice in the South Seas<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: In this radical reexamination of the notion of cannibalism, Gananath Obeyesekere offers a fascinating and convincing argument that cannibalism is mostly "cannibal talk," a discourse on the Other engaged in by both indigenous peoples and colonial intruders that results in sometimes funny and sometimes deadly cultural misunderstandings. Turning his keen intelligence to Polynesian societies in the early periods of European contact and colonization, Obeyesekere deconstructs Western eyewitness accounts, carefully examining their origins and treating them as a species of fiction writing and seamen's yarns. Cannibalism is less a social or cultural fact than a mythic representation of European writing that reflects much more the realities of European societies and their fascination with the practice of cannibalism, he argues. And while very limited forms of cannibalism might have occurred in Polynesian societies, they were largely in connection with human sacrifice and carried out by a select community in well-defined sacramental rituals.
      Cannibal Talkconsiders how the colonial intrusion produced a complex self-fulfilling prophecy whereby the fantasy of cannibalism became a reality as natives on occasion began to eat both Europeans and their own enemies in acts of "conspicuous anthropophagy."<br>

  Abstract: The change in Maori practice is probably the most controversial part of my argument. I present my thesis hesitantly because no one seems to have a clear knowledge of precontact or “traditional” Maori anthropophagy. In fact this phrasing might be a misnomer because New Zealand consisted of a multiplicity of Maori communities, such that, forms of anthropophagy, wherever they existed, would have shown local variations. Conventional ethnography simply constructs an ideal type of Maori cannibalism from a variety of statements—interviews with older men, myths, missionary and magistrate accounts, and even that of eyewitnesses. These sources of information are treated<br>

  Abstract: Despite that fact that I am not as familiar with the political and economic situation of Fiji in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as I am with the Maori, I believe that in Fiji also there developed a form of pronounced anthropophagy that must be seen in terms of the European presence. The lure of trade, the musket wars, and the rise of powerful chiefdoms and the political confederations that resulted drew Fiji gradually into the world capitalist order. We know that pronounced anthropophagy existed in New Zealand mainly, though not exclusively, in the Bay of Islands area.<br>

  II  Middle Platonism and the Interaction of Interpretive Traditions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppp1k">Homer the Theologian</a><br>
  Abstract: The tradition of mystical allegorical commentary on Homer has survived in substantial form only in the writings of the Neoplatonists, but evidence from the first two and a half centuries of the Christian era—before the great synthesis of Plotinus, which marks the beginning of Neoplatonism proper—indicates that this period was a crucial one in the development of that tradition. Félix Buffière’s insistence on the second century as the time of the birth of mystical allegory needs qualification, as the discussion of the role of the Pythagoreans has suggested, but this does not alter the fact that Numenius and<br>

  IV  The Interaction of Allegorical Interpretation and Deliberate Allegory from:

  Abstract: The emergence of allegorical writing on a large scale and the mystical allegorical interpretation of non-epic literature are both developments rooted in the period of the authors we have been discussing. Neither of these developments is well understood, and if neither has found its historian, it is doubtless because the evidence is sparse, difficult to interpret, and often difficult to date. My comments will be limited to a sampling of texts providing evidence that the tradition of allegorical reading we have been examining was, in fact, crucially important in generating patterns of thought about literature and responses to literature that<br>

  Abstract: Up to this point, with the exception of a brief discussion of Prudentius, this study has been concerned exclusively with Greek literature and thought. In fact, much of what has been discussed has been of Italian origin, from the archaic Pythagoreanism of southern Italy to the teachings of Plotinus and Porphyry in Rome. Virtually all the material examined, however, has been Greek in language and tradition. Traces of the Platonized Homer can be found in Latin authors as early as Apuleius,¹ a contemporary of Numenius, but there is no single work in Latin that explores at length the conception of<br>

  Author(s) van der Laan Cornelis<br>
  Abstract: With one estimate of 500 million adherents worldwide, converted in the course of one century, Pentecostalism has become one of the main branches of Christianity.¹ A popular theory locates the origin of Pentecostalism in a 1906 revival meeting at the Azusa Street Mission in Los Angeles. In this community the gifts of the Holy Spirit—for example, speaking in tongues, healing, and prophecy—were discovered and celebrated. There are reports, however, of the more or less simultaneous occurrence of similar movements in other parts of the world. Within a few years of the 1906 upsurge Pentecostalism had in fact established<br>

In addition, it outlines some of the ways in which this movement can be identified by using the family resemblance analogy. It looks at the parameters by which we make categories, offers a flexible and overlapping taxonomy, and examines how various scholars have approached<br>

I follow a historical and phenomenological approach to the conversion narrative, analyzing it as a social construction and not necessarily as a factual description of the main events in an individual’s life. A comprehensive conversion experience changes one’s self-image. This transformation, which is a process taking longer than just one day or one week, is gradually reflected in the most important indicator of conversion:biographical reconstruction.¹ People who undergo a conversion experience literally reconstruct their lives, giving new meanings to old events and putting different<br>

  Abstract: Pentecostals have always been heavily involved in missions and hold missionaries in high esteem as extraordinary heroes of the faith.¹ But they have traditionally not given as much thought to the topic of theology of religions, or interreligious dialogue and encounter, as to other theological loci.² Why this is the case may be related in part to the fact that academic Pentecostalism is but a recent arrival to the theological scene, with its first generation of professionally trained theologians—as opposed to historians or biblical scholars—emerging only since the early 1990s.³ Yet Pentecostal scholars can no longer avoid giving<br>

  Book Title: Controlling Contested Places-Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Shepardson Christine<br>
  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing rival-controlled areas as morally and physically dangerous, leaders in late antiquity fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it.
      Controlling Contested Placesmaps the city of Antioch (Antakya, Turkey) through the topographically sensitive vocabulary of cultural geography, demonstrating the critical role played by physical and rhetorical spatial contests during the tumultuous fourth century. Paying close attention to the manipulation of physical places, Christine Shepardson exposes some of the powerful forces that structured the development of religious orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the late Roman Empire.Theological claims and political support were not the only significant factors in determining which Christian communities gained authority around the Empire. Rather, Antioch's urban and rural places, far from being an inert backdrop against which events transpired, were ever-shifting sites of, and tools for, the negotiation of power, authority, and religious identity. This book traces the ways in which leaders like John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Libanius encouraged their audiences to modify their daily behaviors and transform their interpretation of the world (and landscape) around them. Shepardson argues that examples from Antioch were echoed around the Mediterranean world, and similar types of physical and rhetorical manipulations continue to shape the politics of identity and perceptions of religious orthodoxy to this day.<br>

Usually, they provide an insight into the past in many and varied ways, including ways that are, I suggest, simply impossible to present to students of history through textbooks. This chapter will show how the development of an appreciation of historical facts and historical agency can be achieved most fruitfully through the use of historical novels in the classroom.<br>

  Author(s) Poiana Peter<br>
  Abstract: The notion of framing is one that has emerged as a key factor in current investigations into representations of culture. In the disciplinary area of French Studies, framing is understood as collective and individual rules of identity construction that are based upon a combination of modes of visual production, past and present narratives, and discourses of knowledge and power. The present volume will pursue the question of framing in all three areas.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.20851/j.ctt1t304z1">Framing French Culture</a><br>
  Author(s) Hogarth Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Michel Beaujour states his dissatisfaction with the term 'autoportrait' to encapsulate adequately literary endeavours at self-representation.¹ The connection between self-portraiture and painting is evident, and the slippage of the term across mediums leads, in Beaujour's opinion, to deny the specificity of literary works. Yet, referring to works such as Michel de Montaigne's
                  Essais, Michel Leiris'sL'âge d'hommeand Jean-Jacques Rousseau'sRêveries, Beaujour highlights its usefulness as a tool that distinguishes it from autobiographical texts for two fundamental reasons. First, self-portraiture insists upon an absence of continuity, thus defying any clearly arranged order of events that contribute to a personality created<br>

  Author(s) Orell Julia<br>
  Abstract: Late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe saw an increasing interest in non-European art from Africa, Pre-Columbian America, Asia, the Pacific Islands and elsewhere. Private collectors and museums eagerly collected, exhibited, and published such works, often in competition with each other in the context of colonization.¹ In addition to museums and collectors, artists developed a great interest in non-European art and artifacts since at least the mid-nineteenth century, ranging from Japanese woodcut prints to African masks, often summarized under the problematic category of primitivism. The academic discipline of art history, however, was slow in responding to the broadening range of images and objects<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: By whose “authority” does the church develop doctrine? What guide can aid in differentiating between positive developments and doctrinal distortions? By whose rule can we draw the line between orthodoxy and heterodoxy? The construction of doctrine in the broader Christian tradition and in systematic theology is a complex operation that involves many people over a great span of time with many disciplinary specialties and pastoral concerns.

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: Many debates on the identity of television as a medium and as an art accompanied its expansion in the United States in the late 1940s and in France in the early 1950s. In 1948, Jack Gould mentioned the fact that television found inspiration in preexisting arts to argue that, precisely because it combined “[…] the close-up of the motion picture, the spontaneity of the living stage and the instantaneousness of radio” and was “the fusion of these three elements,” it was absolutely unique.² Reviewing the 1949 season, Flora R.

  Abstract: The film movementin folklore begins much later than that of other fields, but it reflects all of the techniques and preoccupations of earlier documentary filmmakers.¹ Like the “films of fact” shot in the early 1900s, folklore films are often made up of short clips of interesting phenomena captured for posterity. Certain folklore films have a heavily narrated and expository style similar to those documentaries made before World War II and lasting through the 1960s. Other folklore films utilize either a cinéma vérité or postvérité approach or one that combines sync-sound or voice-over with linear depictions for the recording of<br>

  Abstract: “What is the source of our first suffering? It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.” Kept as a reminder in Heaney’s poetry notebook, Gaston Bachelard’s warning could stand as the motto for Heaney’s early work.¹ In
                  Death of a Naturalist,the silent things given speech through the poet’s art derive primarily from his personal history, from the rhythms of the yard experienced in childhood. Not surprisingly, Narcissus is the book’s presiding deity, in whose image Heaney “rhymes to see himself.” With Heaney’s second book,<br>

  Abstract: “Without needing to be theoretically instructed, consciousness quickly realizes that it is the site of variously contending discourses,” Heaney remarked in
                  Crediting Poetry(13). Within the context of his Nobel lecture, Seamus Heaney’s observation reminds the reader that even the apparent innocence of childhood is in fact nothing less than a school “for the complexities of his adult predicament.” In a profound sense, Heaney’s insight at once harkens back to the narrow limits of his first world, as well as the nexus of forces that constitutes its ground. At the same time, it illuminates Heaney’s artistic passage beyond his home,<br>

Some of this may be explained by the fact that Mantero never associated with the other poets and has spent twelve years teaching in the United States, while Crespo published many of his books prior to 1960 and has been living in Puerto Rico for many years.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzs4">The Phenomenology of Prayer</a><br>
  Author(s) CROWE BENJAMIN<br>
  Abstract: An attempt to contribute to a “phenomenology of prayer” ought to begin with the recognition that the word “phenomenology” means many different things to many different people. Moreover, it must be recognized that none of these usages has any obvious claim to being the normative one. Given these inescapable facts, it is therefore incumbent on one who would make such a contribution to define just what it is that he or she might mean by “phenomenology.”<br>

  Abstract: In her autobiography, Edith Stein tells us that at the age of fifteen she “deliberately and consciously” gave up praying.¹ Perhaps the most significant experience between this decision and her return to the practice of prayer with her conversion to Catholicism at the age of thirty was her contact with Edmund Husserl and his theory of phenomenology. In fact it may be the case, as Jude Dougherty has observed,² that her religious conversion was made possible by her philosophical conversion to phenomenology. Husserl, himself a convert to Christianity, understood prayer in terms of the inward turn of his transcendental phenomenology.<br>

I am not so naïve as to ignore the fact that shared existential circumstances impact the reader’s interpretative stance. On the contrary, I readily acknowledge that the reader is prejudiced by hermeneutical assumptions that mirror a complex web of factors ranging from the socioeconomic<br>

  Abstract: There is a variety of literary settings in which the ideal of spiritual eroticism cultivated in the mystical piety of various traditions has found expression, but one medium that has been especially significant in the history of Judaism and Christianity is the commentarial tradition on the Song of Songs, the biblical book that most overtly employs tropes of sensual love and carnal sexuality.¹ As Bernard McGinn astutely articulated the matter, “Among the many intimate bonds between Jewish and Christian mystical traditions none is more important than the fact that both found in the Song of Songs the mystical text par<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Author(s) Connolly William E.<br>
  Abstract: What is the connection today between evangelical Christianity, cowboy capitalism, the electronic news media, and the Republican Party?¹ Can these connections be understood through the terms of efficient causality, in which you first separate factors and then show how one is the basic cause, or how they cause each other, or how they together reflect a more basic cause? Does, say, a corporate-Republican elite manipulate the evangelical wing of this assemblage, leading the latter to subordinate its economic interests to spurious appeals to faith? Or are the leading parties to this coalition linked first and foremost by economic interests, in<br>

  Author(s) Jaume Lucien<br>
  Abstract: One of the complexities presented by
                  Democracy in Americais that Tocqueville continuously intertwines his observations of the American case (including the exceptional factors that distinguish the first “republic in a large country,” as one used to say in that period) with the attempt to define a type (or ideal type) that stands out through the American example. This complexity is particularly felt in the case of Tocqueville’s discussion of religion, a topic where he pursues several related or parallel questions: First, what is the common trait that characterizes all of the sects of American Christianity? Second, in what way<br>

  Abstract: “Reading” is a term that, through overuse, can easily become confused with interpretation. In fact, there is a crucial difference: Reading involves the undoing of interpretative figures; because it is not an operation opposed to the understanding but rather a precondition for it, it allows us to question whether the synthetic moves of the understanding can close off a text. It leads away from meaning to such problems as the text’s constitution and meaning generation. Unlike interpretation, which implies a development over the course of a narrative toward a single figure reconciling all its diverse moments, reading states the logic<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Author(s) SHERWOOD YVONNE<br>
  Abstract: The seductive enigma of the word
                  passion—and the Christian passion to which it is tied—seems to me to lie in the way in which it allows the subject at its center to function as subject and object both at once. Derived from Latinpassioand Greekpathos, it is bound, in its first appearances in anything we would recognize as English, to passivity, suffering, affliction, and “the fact or condition of being acted upon or affected by an external agency” (OED). As if to illustrate this sense of passion as the subjection of the subject, the word was<br>

  Abstract: The statement by T.S. Eliot with which I begin is not without its problems, the most obvious of them the difficulty of actually defining “poetry.” Yet it seems worth sticking with Eliot’s formulation for the time being, inasmuch as too often the fact that the Song of Songs is poetry—and not another thing—seems to be forgotten by interpreters, or at least neglected. What would it mean to consider the Song of Songs as poetry? And further, what
                  kindof poetry do we find in the Song of Songs? What are the “other things” that it ought not to<br>

  Author(s) KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: The Song of Songs offers no single, stable perspective from which to view the amorous scenes unveiled on its pages. Most readers of the Song from antiquity to the present have, however, been inclined to identify with the female figure traditionally known as the Shulammite. But who is the Shulammite, and who, for that matter, is her beloved? The sustained ambiguities of identity and fluid reversals of erotic roles have made this text fertile ground for conceiving and reconceiving the mysteries of desire, in particular, the mysteries of
                  divine desire—despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that God is<br>

  Abstract: So many loves. A time of depletion after excess. Afterward—is it the lull of exhaustion or satisfaction, disappointment or fulfillment, detumescence or engorgement? Or some uneasy incompletion? The seduction has been attempted, we may be falling in love or out, getting up or going down, ascending, descending or just turning, oh, God. An afterword comes too late, or too soon; the double entendres are dissipating, the flesh has confessed, the closet is open, the book is closing, and still we may not have figured it out. “It” almost came, is still to come, may have come and gone already.<br>

  Abstract: Could elements of “nature” appear to us as what Jean-Luc Marion calls “saturated phenomena”?¹ And if so, how might that be useful for environmental thinking? While at first glance it might seem obvious that natural phenomena could be experienced as saturated, Marion himself has never employed such phenomena as examples for his notion of the saturated phenomenon. In fact, there is almost no reference to (nonhuman) animals anywhere in his work and a tree is mentioned only once and in that case is listed together with a triangle as a “technical object” and thus a “poor” phenomenon.² Marion has never<br>

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  Author(s) Bloch Chana<br>
  Abstract: “Kiss me, make me drunk with your kisses! Your sweet loving / is better than wine.”¹ The great love poem that begins with these words does not follow the conventional romantic plot: boy meets girl, boy and girl get acquainted, boy proposes marriage. That the two are already intimate is clear from the very first words of the Song of Songs. Love, not marriage, is what they propose, and the woman, who is called the Shulamite, does most of the proposing. She, in fact, is the one who issues that first urgent invitation. If she declares that his loving is<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Romance, She Wrote: A Hermeneutical Essay on Song of Songs,¹ I argue that the Song contains erotic descriptions that neither ask for nor require justification. In vivid contrast to the prophetic writings, in which eros is employed only in condemnation, it affirms, even revels in, sensual life. In fact, the Song’s eroticism is deliberately subversive in its challenge to the institutions of the Hellenistic era (ca. 333–175 bce), the probable time of its composition. I take it that the book’s author is a woman and that this female authorship adds to its polemical celebration of “free” love, that<br>

  Author(s) Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: In an essay in this volume, Ellen Davis contests the predominant scholarly understanding that the Song of Songs gained its place within the canon entirely because the rabbis
                  misread the book, taking it not as a poem about human love, but as pertaining rather to the love of God and Israel. She contends that this scholarly view represents a misunderstanding, that in fact “the Song was correctly understood by those who accorded it a place among Israel’s Scriptures.”¹ Thus, in Davis’s view, the Song “really is, in large part, about the love that obtains between God and Israel—or, more<br>

  Author(s) ANDREWS MICHAEL F.<br>
  Abstract: Similar to many contemporary postmodern philosophers, the phenomenologist Edith Stein rejected certain “modernist assumptions” concerning the human self and the self’s experience of God. Although she did not live to participate in contemporary discussions on modernism,¹ I submit that Stein would, in fact, be quite sympathetic to several postmodern philosophical trends. In this essay, I shall describe how Edith Stein rejects an Enlightenment view of the self in a manner similar to that of Jean-Luc Marion. I will also show how Stein, like Marion, remains genuinely committed to the apophatic tradition, drawing effortlessly on the negative theological imagery of Dionysius<br>

  Author(s) BLOECHL JEFFREY<br>
  Abstract: The question of experience of God may be taken to respond to the thought that experience of God has become questionable. Heard in this way, the question summons the idea that what we call “God” is in fact not God, whether this is taken to mean simply that there is no God or that God is somehow other or more than what we say. The fact that the experience of God can be the theme of questioning and inquiry thus informs us that reflection on the experience of God is always accompanied by doubt, whether this doubt is only the<br>

  Author(s) Laclau Ernesto<br>
  Abstract: God is nameless for no one can either speak of him or know him. . . . Accordingly, if I say that “God is good,” this is not true. I am good, but God is not good! In fact, I would rather say that I am better than God, for what is good can become better and what can become better can become the best! Now God is not good, and so he cannot become better, he cannot become the best. These three are far from God: “good,” “better,” “best,” for he is wholly transcendent. . . . Also you<br>

  Abstract: In the acceleration of the tempo of historical developments in which we live, two factors, it seems to me, stand out above all others as characteristics of a development that, earlier, began only slowly. The first is the formation of a world society in which individual political, economic, and cultural powers depend, more and more, on each other, and come into contact and permeate each other in their different spheres of life. The other is the development of man’s possibilities, of his power to make and to destroy, possibilities that, exceeding everything to which we have previously been accustomed, raise<br>

  Abstract: JOHN RAWLS IS A SAINT. In the words of Amy Gutmann, who remarked, when delivering his eulogy, that she felt “privileged to have lived in his time,” Rawls was “saintly as well as wise.”¹ Within certain communities of political theorists, such sentiment appears to be widespread, as is evident from expressions of personal admiration in the wake of Rawls’s death. The general fact of this sentiment presents a number of problems, not only for a highly private man who by all accounts went to great lengths to avoid celebrity, let alone sainthood, but also for secular liberals who share in<br>

  Author(s) Das Veena<br>
  Abstract: Writing in 1994, Gyanendra Pandey, the well-known historian of the subaltern, took the neglect of the Partition in the social sciences and in Indian public culture to be a symptom of a deep malaise.¹ Historical writing in India, he argued, was singularly uninterested in the popular construction of Partition, the trauma it produced, and the sharp division between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs it left behind. He attributed this blindness to the fact that the historian’s craft has never been particularly comfortable with such matters as “the horror of Partition, the anguish and sorrow, pain and brutality of the ‘riots’ of<br>

  Author(s) Smith Christian<br>
  Abstract: All human communities face the general challenge of social reproduction—that is, socializing subsequent generations to carry on community identities and practices. Meeting this challenge successfully requires effective practices of socialization, identity formation, role modeling, intergenerational transference of authority, and so on. Many other factors, however, typically play into the success or breakdown of social reproduction, including competing institutional demands and changing social environmental conditions that make passing on a collective way of life over time more or less difficult. Religious communities are only one among many types of human communities that face this general challenge of reproducing themselves in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x07ns">The Relevance of Royce</a><br>
  Author(s) Shew Melissa<br>
  Abstract: While scholarly attention has been paid to the influence of German idealism on the thought of Josiah Royce, few scholars have examined the relationship between Royce and Greek philosophy. When sustained attention has been given to this relationship, the focus has been on connections between Plato and Royce.¹ It is undeniable, however, that Royce also engaged the thought of Aristotle throughout his philosophical career.² In fact, some of his earliest writings, from his undergraduate days at the University of California at Berkeley, attest to Royce’s interest in Aristotle. “The Aim of Poetry” (1875) and “The Life-Harmony” (1875) are short essays,<br>

  Author(s) Mahowald Mary B.<br>
  Abstract: As a philosophy graduate student in the 1960s, I was struck by the statement of Royce that his entire philosophy was encapsulated in his conception of community. Initially, my interest was sparked by the fact that I lived in a small community, and the term, as I understood it, identified an appealing ideal of how human beings in general might live or aspire to live together. I also thought, perhaps naively, that this ideal could be practically implemented, at least in part. So I wrote my dissertation on Royce, tracking how a pragmatic element intertwined with idealism in the development<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x08ps">Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions</a><br>
  Abstract: There appears to be a curious incompatibility between seduction and any proper sort of epistemology.
                  Knowledge, with its firm and enduring grasp of true facts and its carefully maintained distance from opinion, seems clearly opposed both to the reserve, mystery, and elusive play of seduction and to theunknowing in the face of the infinite by which even slightly apophatic theology is not inaptly characterized. When we try to think the divine or the sacred, we think that reserve and mystery; perhaps we also think of origin or ground, of joy or ecstasy, or of the world newly revealed as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x08ps">Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions</a><br>
  Abstract: The very notion of seductive ethics is likely to give us pause, to seem more error than paradox. Ethics is more often than not conceived as the very resistance to seduction, if not in fact to any sort of pleasure (or bliss, which seems to undermine the ethical subject).¹ It is dutiful, we think, a little bit ascetic (provided we don’t overly enjoy our asceticism), rule-bound or abstemiously virtuous. And if seduction is about sustaining the possible, then to prescribe, whether character or behavior, seems contradictory to it. But the prescriptions of ethics are not always a matter of foreclosure;<br>

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

This question, first posed in the context of American neocommunitarianism, is emerging once again in Europe, above all in France and Italy, as we venture a new thought about community. This question is not only legitimate but in certain ways quite unavoidable at a time when democratic culture is interrogating its own theoretical mandates and its own future. However, this doesn’t change the fact that the question is incorrect in its very formulation, or<br>

  Abstract: Humankind has always seen community and violence as inherently related. Such a relation is, in fact, at the heart of the most important expressions of culture across history, be they of art, literature, or philosophy. The first graffiti etched in prehistoric grottoes depicted the human community through scenes of violence (hunting, sacrifice, battles). So too would war be the theme of the first great poem of Western civilization. Almost all world literatures, from the Hebrew to the Egyptian to the Indian, open with interhuman conflict and its images of violence and death to confirm for us a connection between community<br>

  Author(s) MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Among the most promising-seeming possibilities for an ethics linked to theology—always a risky proposition—is that of regarding the world as sacramental. A sacramental sensibility seems, potentially at least, a way to a valuing of some aspects of the world, but not a way particularly welcoming of the strange or the stranger. But fundamental to such a sensibility, I want to argue here, is a discipline of attention, of a carefully open listening, and such an attentiveness in fact requires that we listen to what we do not already understand, what sounds in our ears and appears to our<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: American philosophy has been dominated by the theme of “Nature.”¹ From Edwards to Emerson to Dewey to Dennett, American thought has variously invoked Nature. But to articulate a philosophy of Nature is not thereby to espouse a form of “naturalism.” In fact, philosophies undertaken in the name of “naturalism” seem to have a different temperament than those that begin with the
                  thoughtof Nature as such. As a theme, “Nature” invites an expansive mood for reflection, while “naturalism” sounds constrictive and combative. “Nature” disposes the mind to musement, “pondering,”theoria, Denken—to becoming Emerson’s “transparent eyeball.” “Naturalism” has something of<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

I shall argue thatThe Sorcerer’s Apprenticeallows a single instance of narrating. As a way into an interpretation of that sound, however, we should remember another moment, a strange passage at the midpoint of the piece, at which its entire musical progress comes to a full stop.

  Abstract: The main difficulty in discussing chance in historiography is the fact that this subject has its own history, which as yet is unwritten. It is certainly impossible to discuss the role of chance in any given situation without first taking into account the whole terminology of the historian concerned. One needs to ask what is the opposite term that will exclude chance, or what is the overall term that makes it relative. Raymond Aron, for instance, begins his introduction to the philosophy of history with the antithesis, based on Cournot, between “

The result is an apocalypse with a happy ending—for the Poe-narrator at least, if not for the rest of us—since consciousness ends where it began: with itself alone, and all because God’s plan has been carried through without a flaw.<br>

  Author(s) Ames Roger T.<br>
  Abstract: A minimum standard of justice would seem to require that all U.S. children have equal access to U.S. educational institutions, and that any school admissions policy that would exclude a candidate on the basis of race or ethnicity is in clear violation of this principle. Such a basic standard has certainly been upheld by the judgment of the Supreme Court in lawsuits where it was contravened. But I want to argue that the Court in coming to such a decision not only might be failing to serve justice, but in fact would be compounding a grave injustice—at least in<br>

  Abstract: There are two contrasting images of Islamic economics that are often evoked today, and both are wrong. One is that Islamic finance has done well in the banking crises that began in the twenty-first century, the implication being that it is more solidly based and less speculative. Opposed to that is the image of Islam as an obstacle to the flourishing of the economies of the Islamic world because it is so restrictive as to what can be done with money and how property can be passed down to the next generation. Yet the fact is that Islamic banks have<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  Book Title: Playful Identities-The Ludification of Digital Media Cultures<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: In
      Playful Identities, eighteen scholars examine the increasing role of digital media technologies in identity construction through play. Going beyond computer games, this interdisciplinary collection argues that present-day play and games are not only appropriate metaphors for capturing postmodern human identities, but are in fact the means by which people create their identity. From discussions of World of Warcraft and Foursquare to digital cartographies, the combined essays form a groundbreaking volume that features the most recent insights in play and game studies, media research, and identity studies.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brqd4">Playful Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: A playful specter is haunting the world. Since the 1960s, when the use of the word “ludic” became popular in both Europe and the US to designate playful behavior and artifacts, playfulness has become increasingly a mainstream characteristic of modern and postmodern culture. In the first decade of the 21st century we can even speak of the global “ludification of culture” (Raessens 2006; 2014). Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood movies.

  11.  Ludic identities and the magic circle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brqd4">Playful Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Calleja Gordon<br>

  Abstract: In
      Playful Identities, eighteen scholars examine the increasing role of digital media technologies in identity construction through play. Going beyond computer games, this interdisciplinary collection argues that present-day play and games are not only appropriate metaphors for capturing postmodern human identities, but are in fact the means by which people create their identity. From discussions of World of Warcraft and Foursquare to digital cartographies, the combined essays form a groundbreaking volume that features the most recent insights in play and game studies, media research, and identity studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): van Maas Sander<br>
  Abstract: Present-day music studies conspicuously evade the question of religion in contemporary music. Although many composers address the issue in their work, as yet there have been few attempts to think through the structure of religious music as we hear it. On the basis of a careful analysis of Olivier Messiaen's work, this book argues for a renewal of our thinking about religious music. Addressing his notion of a hyper-religiousmusic of sounds and colors, it aims to show that Messiaen has broken new ground. His reinvention of religious music makes us again aware of the fact that religious music, if taken in its proper radical sense, belongs to the foremost of musical adventures.The work of Olivier Messiaen is well known for its inclusion of religious themes and gestures. These alone, however, do not seem enough to account for the religious status of the work. Arguing for a breakthrough toward the beyondon the basis of the synaesthetic experience of music, Messiaen invites a confrontation with contemporary theologians and post-secular thinkers. How to account for a religious breakthrough that is produced by a work of art?Starting from an analysis of his 1960s oratorio La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur Jsus-Christ, this book arranges a moderated dialogue between Messiaen and the music theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, the phenomenology of revelation of Jean-Luc Marion, the rethinking of religion and technics in Jacques Derrida and Bernard Stiegler, and the Augustinian ruminations of Sren Kierkegaard and Jean-Franois Lyotard. Ultimately, this confrontation underscores the challenging yet deeply affirmative nature of Messiaen's music.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brzn4">The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond</a><br>
  Abstract: Is what is convincing also true? This classic question often preoccupied me when leaving the concert hall or church where, just before, a work by the French composer Olivier Messiaen (Avignon, December 10 , 1908–Paris, April 27, 1992) had been performed. The question seems naýïve, because the occasion is so evidently about experiencing a work of art that is manufactured, shaped by human hands, not a religious, sacramental ritual. Nonetheless, the great power of some of Messiaen’s work still forces this question on the listener—and I am not alone in this respect. The euphoric ovations or reverent testimony<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brzn4">The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond</a><br>
  Abstract: The notion of saturation surfaced more than once in the discussion of the dazzlement passages in Chapter 2. A saturated sound-image was created with Messiaen’s so-called turning chords (
                  La Transfiguration, Part VIII); along with that, different forms of chromatic saturation were mentioned, as with the sound field of the third movement (Part XII) or the fully chromatic chords in both chorales (Parts VII and XIV). Especially in these latter instances, saturation pertained to a parametric phenomenon: the notion referred to the fact that all twelve tones on the chromatic scale occurred in the sound field or the relevant chord form.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14brzn4">The Reinvention of Religious Music: Olivier Messiaen's Breakthrough Toward the Beyond</a><br>
  Abstract: The varied and conflicting vocabularies Messiaen uses when speaking of his own work are a reflection of the complex cultural-historical background that informs it: secularization, individualization, modernism, postmodernism, and technology, to name a few. In the opening paragraph of his
                  Conférence de Kyoto, Messiaen blames the lack of understanding that often informs the reception of his work on the decline of faith. He laments the fact that as a “Christian and a Roman Catholic,” he speaks of “God, Divine Mysteries, and the Mystery of Christ to unbelievers or people who have little knowledge of religion and theology.”¹ This sounds like<br>

  Abstract: Messiaen’s discourse on
                  éblouissementand the possibility of a breakthrough toward the beyond is surprisingly radical. This is not only because the composer calls attention to the actual possibility of religious music—and in a certain sense hyperreligious music, for Messiaen places it above religious music—in an age when, to all appearances, this possibility had definitively turned into its opposite, but also because of his surprising move of connecting the domain of religious experience directly to the coordinates of the musical artifact. In this way, he suggests that a religious experience can be evoked by musical-technical means, countering the<br>

  Author(s) Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: For the time of a brief note, for the moment, let us analyze this central proposition of Christianity:
                  verbum caro factum est(in Greek and in the Gospel of John:logos sarx egeneto). That is the formula of the “incarnation” by which God makes himself man, and that humanity of God is indeed the decisive trait of Christianity, and through it a determinative trait for the whole of Western culture—including the heart of its “humanism,” which it marks indelibly, or may even be its basis (in return for a “divinization” of man—to stick to a short summary treatment).<br>

  4  The Impossibility of Intentionless Meaning from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14bs87q">Intention Interpretation</a><br>
  Author(s) MICHAELS WALTER BENN<br>
  Abstract: The clearest example OF the tendency to generate theoretical problems by splitting apart terms that are in fact inseparable is the persistent debate over the relation between authorial intention and the meaning of texts. Some theorists have claimed that valid interpretations can only be obtained through an appeal to authorial intentions. This assumption is shared by theorists who, denying the possibility of recovering authorial intentions, also deny the possibility of valid interpretations. But once it is seen that the meaning of a text is simply identical to the author’s intended meaning, the project of
                  groundingmeaning in intention becomes incoherent.<br>

  Abstract: In the early 1900s when the American film industry was just getting on its feet, several million Irish and Italians immigrated to America looking for prosperity. They had fled the grinding poverty of Kilkenny and Catania, endured terrible hardships at sea, and then signed up for twelve-hour shifts in American factories. But at least they could feed a large family and gradually build up some savings. Nothing in their ethnic values or their religion prevented them from subscribing to the country’s Anglo-Protestant ethic of hard work, private ownership, and success.<br>

Sensitivity to the rule encourages children to seek counterexamples to universal judgments. Second, I will argue that sociological models that attempt to delineate the roots of prejudice can be complemented by an understanding of the rule of contradiction.

  Abstract: The way of the cross is adversarial, yes, but the embodied expression of that way under conditions of empire is neither violent tactical maneuvering nor passive endurance. Both of these responses may be necessary in certain situations. But the binary of violence/nonviolence is not the most important consideration when weighing how to express an adversarial politics. The greater question is how effective action is possible—action that will, in fact, resist and transform. This chapter turns to the second defining characteristic of Jesus’ way of the cross after its adversarial politics: the forging of dramatic action. It points to the<br>

  Author(s) Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The present volume gathers most of the papers presented at an international theological conference held May 23–25, 2013, at the University of Geneva and organized by the
                  Faculté de théologie protestanteand theInstitut romand de systématique et d’éthique(IRSE) of that University. The conference’s main purposes were to examine the first two chapters of Paul’s First Epistle to the Corinthians, (aspects of) the reception of these chapters in the history of theology, and, in a constructive approach, their potential meaning today. The fact that two systematic theologians (the co-editors of this book) and a historian of early Christianity<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j7p4">Douglas Coupland</a><br>
  Abstract: Belief, or its absence, haunts Douglas Coupland’s most dispirited protagonists. The wilderness reflections, for example, uttered by the anonymous narrator of ‘In the Desert’ – one of the thematically interconnected narratives in
                  Life After God– pivot around a sensation of spiritual dissatisfaction that is shared by many individuals in Coupland’s fiction. This desert sojourner’s conviction that he was raised in a creedal vacuum, without fixed beliefs – a personal history ‘clean of any ideology’ – is optimistic but, as he suspects, not entirely credible. The blank-slate, zero history contexts that he and many of his contemporaries view as normative are, above all else,<br>

  2  The Traveller colonised from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j9t5">"Insubordinate Irish"</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of group origins as a marker for cultural legitimacy is today often considered a very recent development, a development that can be attributed entirely to modernity. The issues of ethnogenesis, group origins, kin-related heredity and apparent ‘legitimacy’ in both cultural and historic terms were all issues which fascinated intellectuals and scholarly communities in the nineteenth century and earlier, however. In fact such subjects or ‘objects of enquiry’ would actually serve as the backdrop to the very first ‘institutionally-inspired’ studies of Travellers and Gypsies in Western Europe.<br>

  Abstract: I have briefly traced the development of the Irish ‘Othering’ tradition as encompassed in a reiterative and reductionist discourse because Ireland’s history of colonisation has meant that the ‘official’ version of the Irish people (including Irish Travellers) and Irish history is, it can be argued, itself a form of ‘Othering’. Healy’s statement regarding the ‘manufactured’ or mediated nature of much of the historical record can be seen to be particularly pertinent to Irish history: ‘History is a construct, often a narrative of interested parties who seek to prove a thesis’ (Healy, 1992: 15).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jbh0">The structure of modern cultural theory</a><br>
  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu was a contrarian and sociologist, perhaps in that order. As with Adorno and Foucault, he can be claimed, also, for a further intellectual lineage – that of ethical reflection as opposed to just negatively critical, denunciatory sociology. This does not just mean that Bourdieu was right-minded and ‘ethical’ in the sense of being moral (whatever one might mean by this). It means that his work is addressed as much to issues of the self, and especially to our reflexivity and autonomy, as to just epistemic issues of positive ‘knowledge’ and denunciatory critique. In fact, the – again, ultimately ethical – issues<br>

  Abstract: Hegel’s work has come in recent years to exemplify many of the choices facing contemporary philosophy. The changed status of Hegel can, though, seem rather odd, given the labyrinthine nature of his texts, the huge divergences between his interpreters from his own time until today, and the fact that some of the philosophers who now invoke him come from an analytical tradition noted for its insistence on a clarity not always encountered in Hegel himself. Even contemporary interpreters range between those who still pursue his grand aims by trying to show how he offers a systematic answer to the major<br>

  Book Title: Jesus the Central Jew-His Times and His People<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
  Abstract: In this book, LaCocque presents the case that Jesus was totally and unquestionably a Jew. He lived as a Jew, thought as a Jew, debated as a Jew, acted as a Jew and died as a Jew. He had no intention of creating a new religion; rather, he was a reformer of the Judaism of his day. True, his critique went far beyond an intellectual subversion. In fact, Jesus progressively thought of himself as the "Son of Man" inaugurating the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth.<br>

  12  Jesus Is Betrayed from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: The fate of both Jesus and the temple is—at least in the eyes of some early Christians—clearly consolidated into one large-scale event. John 2:21 says that, when Jesus spoke of the coming destruction of the temple, he was speaking of his own body. Witnesses at his trial accused him of forecasting the end of the temple—which in fact occurred some forty years later. It seems reasonable to conclude that both the cross and the temple ruins after 70 CE were seen as a dual inauguration of a new and final chapter in Israel’s history. True, the accusation<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: The text of the gospel contains a canto of citations from the Hebrew Scriptures, and this for good reason, for the gospel writers wanted the Jewish roots of its message to be strong and conclusive.¹ Even an apparently non- Jew like Luke is eager to “prove” the authenticity of the messianic identity of Jesus by frequently citing the Hebrew Bible. In fact, this dependence of the gospel on Jewish traditions goes well beyond these quotations. The Hebrew Scriptures provided a rich hermeneutic treasure trove for the evangelists to build pesharim and haggadoth, illustrating the providential events of the life of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: In the united states, at the mention of “religion,” what people often think of first is a moral code. We’re a pragmatic people; we’re practical people; we’re concerned about how to do things and how to act. In fact, pragmatism as a philosophy argues that theorizing follows action. Whereas classical Western wisdom stresses the thinking first and only thereupon the action that follows, Americans are very strong on action, and when it comes to defining religion, we tend to divide religions according to how they influence people’s behavior. Is it a “strict” religion? Is it an “easy” religion? What does<br>

  Abstract: The first text in the Torah that will be analysed is the song of Moses in Deuteronomy 32:1–43. There are two good reasons for this. One is the already noted fact that 32:4 is the only Torah text that proclaims God is just in all his ways, righteous and upright. This claim applies not just to all that God says and does in the Torah but to all that God will say and do in the future. Another reason is that the song is located at a strategic point in the Torah and exercises an important function in relation<br>

Does this signal that the overall purpose of the Psalter is the praise of God and to urge its users to join in that praise? As well as this, within the five books there<br>

However Clines himself thinks that it is the ‘moral order of the world, of the principles on which it is governed’ by the divinity.¹ The two views are in fact related because the reality of innocent suffering questions in what sense, or whether in any sense, God’s governance of creation can be called just.

Church councils, church authorities, preachers, teachers, and so many others contribute to our understanding of the phrase, from literal to highly metaphoric.

The intuition is simply a storyteller’s conviction, after working with the text of 1–2 Samuel for a while, that no storytellers worth their salt would be able to tell some of the stories the way they are in the text.¹ In exciting areas, they are too bare, too bald; they cry out for embellishment. Commonsense logic says that as well as the simple telling of a story and the skilled fashioning of a story as a work of literary art, there is also the<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about our need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The story of the rise of secular redemptive hope narratives from the age of Enlightenment to the early part of the twenty-first century has been a story of the struggle between heightened expectations and postutopian despair.¹ The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Obama in 2008—followed by the diminution of these expectations—was a stark reminder that redemptive hope is seldom satisfactorily fulfilled. Although what led to the dashing<br>

  Abstract: En este libro, defendemos la idea de que las comisiones de estudio sobre la violencia son tecnologías o artefactos institucionales de construcción de memorias históricas sobre lo ocurrido en Colombia desde mediados de los años cuarenta hasta hoy. En ese sentido, pensamos que las comisiones de estudio sobre la violencia han funcionado, en medio del conflicto, como correas transmisoras de narrativas de país, como intentos de gestión pública de las violencias y como dispositivos de producción histórica de versiones sobre el conflicto, en unos marcos temporales que son vividos de diversas maneras por los actores involucrados (véase rufer 2010).

  Book Title: Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sitze Adam<br>
  Abstract: In this fascinating and rare little book, a leading Italian feminist philosopher and the Archbishop of Milan face off over the contemporary meaning of the biblical commandment not to kill. The result is a series of erudite and wide-ranging arguments that move from murder and suicide to just war and drone strikes, from bioethics and biopolitics to hermeneutics and philology, from Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer to Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, from Torah and Scripture to art and literature, from the essence of human dignity and the paradoxes of fratricide to engagements with Levinasian ethics. Less a direct debate than a disputation in the classical sense, Thou Shalt Not Kill proves to be a searching meditation on one of the unstated moral premises shared by otherwise bitterly opposed political factions. It will stimulate the mind of the novice while also reminding more advanced readers of the necessity and desirability of thinking in the present.<br>

  HOMO NECANS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16f8cb0">Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue</a><br>
  Abstract: Scholars from various disciplines currently hold the opinion that homicide is an anthropological constant, a distinctive trait of the universally understood human spirit, a bloody trademark of the species. It appears we must say much the same for war as a permanent factor in the history of man and for the transcultural presence of vendetta in archaic societies. Tribal avenger or warrior—and founder of community—the masculine figure resides in the stories of the origin in many versions, with a certain documentable persistence. And when research like this takes up the evolutionary model and turns to looking into the<br>

  Abstract: Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed.

  Abstract: The lover “declares his love as one declares war” (EP, 79; PE, 129). So insists Marion repeatedly in his investigation into the nature of the erotic phenomenon. War, of course, is here “only” a metaphor illustrating the absolute commitment of the lover. Yet the fact that this analogy is used several times throughout

Hopkins in particular was quite prolific, producing over 50 clay animated segments for the weeklyUniversal Screen Magazine.But by the 1920s, cartoon animation using either cels or slash system was firmly established as the dominant mode of animation<br>

  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Author(s) RAGLIN JACK<br>
  Abstract: While it has become de rigueur to portray the zombie onslaught as a war, this analogy is in fact seriously flawed and can result in lethal outcomes for humans who hew to orthodox strategies of offensive or defensive warfare. Consider that zombie warfare is not driven by a religious motive or geopolitical objective. Beyond the common innate drive to consume human flesh, zombies exhibit no cooperative group objective. Moreover, zombie predation does not appear to be driven by any planned or organized strategies conforming to the strictures of either traditional or terrorist warfare, although as described later, sufficient densities of<br>

  Abstract: When Betsy Connell, female lead in Jacques Tourneur’s
                  I Walked with a Zombie(1943), confesses that is she isn’t in fact familiar with zombies, her interlocutor, Dr. Maxwell, first tells her that she is dealing with “a ghost, the living dead” and then informs her more cheerfully that the Zombie is also a drink, at which point Betsy finds herself on more familiar territory. “I tried one once,” she says, “but there wasn’t anything dead about it.” Uttered in 1943 at the height of Hollywood’s tiki craze, these lines are no doubt an inside joke.

  INTRODUCTION: from:

  Author(s) Hekman Susan<br>
  Abstract: The purpose of this anthology is to bring the material, specifically the materiality of the human body and the natural world, into the forefront of feminist theory and practice. This is no small matter indeed, and we expect this collection to spark intense debate. Materiality, particularly that of bodies and natures, has long been an extraordinarily volatile site for feminist theory—so volatile, in fact, that the guiding rule of procedure for most contemporary feminisms requires that one distance oneself as much as possible from the tainted realm of materiality by taking refuge within culture, discourse, and language.

  Author(s) Barad Karen<br>
  Abstract: Language has been granted too much power. The linguistic turn, the semiotic turn, the interpretative turn, the cultural turn: it seems that at every turn lately every “thing”—even materiality—is turned into a matter of language or some other form of cultural representation. The ubiquitous puns on “matter” do not, alas, mark a rethinking of the key concepts (materiality and signification) and the relationship between them. Rather, it seems to be symptomatic of the extent to which matters of “fact” (so to speak) have been replaced with matters of signification (no scare quotes here). Language matters. Discourse matters.

  Author(s) Oppermann Serpil<br>
  Abstract: An ancient Mediterranean landscape; an endangered species in the Amazon; the Library of Congress; the Gulf Stream; carcinogenic cells, DNA, dioxin; a volcano, a school, a city, a factory farm; the outbreak of a virus, a toxic plume; bio-luminescent water; your eyes, our hands, this book: what do all these things have in common? The answer to this question is simple. Whether visible or invisible, socialized or wild, they are all material forms emerging in combination with forces, agencies, and other matter. Entangled in endless ways, their “more-than-human” materiality is a constant process of shared becoming that tells us something<br>

  Abstract: Responding to his country’s record rainfalls in the beginning of the twenty-first century, British journalist Brian Cathcart seems to bring more of it.
                  Rainmakes a dreary forecast: “It is only when things go wrong that our dim consciousness of scientific meteorology rises to the surface” (66). French sociologist of science Bruno Latour would diagnose this tendency as “blackboxing.” Focusing only on the success of a scientific or technological apparatus paradoxically renders “the joint production of actors and artifacts entirely opaque” (Hope 183).¹ When a meteorology machine runs smoothly, it produces factual climates that we can reasonably predict and accurately<br>

  Author(s) Appold Mark<br>
  Abstract: Seldom do biblical scholars reach full agreement on issues of textual interpretation. That certainly has to do with the very nature of the texts themselves. One notable exception, the product of two centuries of scholarship, is the now generally accepted recognition that none of the four Gospels can be read simply as historical reportage but that each one must rather be taken as an ultimately irresolvable mix of discoverable “facts” and faith. The problem does not hang on a simple either/or but on an examination of the many points in between. Johannine scholarship has examined virtually every interpretive possibility that<br>

  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel is the most historical of all the Gospels. While it has been entitled “the spiritual Gospel,” its depth of spiritual insight does not in any way detract from its focus on the actual life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.¹ In fact, this Gospel proclaims that history is now the locus of the divine presence. In the flesh of Jesus, we have the eternal Word of God. For this reason, history is now radiant with the glory of God: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the<br>

  Abstract: In discussing the historical plausibility or otherwise of episodes or speeches in the Fourth Gospel, a number of important interpretative decisions have to be taken. These methodological issues cannot be discussed in detail in this essay. My own opinion, as stated in my study of Galilee and the Gospels, is as follows: “The fact that Galilee enters the ironic patterns that the author (John) seeks to develop, shows just how important the memories associated with the region were to Christian self-understanding, even when there is no concern to develop a realistic narrative of that setting” (Freyne 1988, 131–32).

  Imitating Jesus: from:

  Abstract: From earliest days, John has been viewed as the “spiritual gospel” (πνευματικὸν εὐαγγέλιον), while the “external facts” (actually, “the bodily things” (τὰ σωματικὰ) were preserved in the Synoptics (a saying originally attributed to Clement of Alexandria by Eusebius,
                  Hist. eccl.6.14.7). Thus John has been seen as relatively late and Hellenistic, and primarily theological, while the Synoptics were seen as earlier and more Jewish, and therefore, according to this argument, more historical. Not surprisingly, then, John has been neglected in the various quests for the historical Jesus. Nowhere is this contrast more obvious than with regard to the ethical teaching<br>

This observation makes plain the ways we may be tempted to draw a straight line from the meaning of a text to the truth of that meaning, assuming that both can be exhaustively captured and assessed on the basis of the written word alone.<br>

  Abstract: What profoundly marks Catholicism’s relationship to democracy and culture in Indonesia is the fact that Catholics are a minority in a majority Muslim country. Yet, given the profound commitment of Indonesians to the principles of democracy, Catholics have often found themselves at the table of political and civic discourse and involved in the processes of democratization. Nevertheless, the contributions Catholics have made to Indonesian society and government have always remained in the shadow of their minority status. Because of this status, Indonesian Catholics struggle to find their voice and to come to terms with the reality of precisely how effective<br>

  Abstract: The adoption and expansion of video games in Peru has been relatively slow, mainly due to the hard economic situation the country was going through during much of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Video game history in Peru basically starts with the introduction of arcade machines during the beginning of the 1980s. At that time, a small number of businesses appeared, ranging from medium-sized arcade game centers, which deployed tens of machines, to small stores that had just a handful of them. The majority of arcade machines was provided by Japanese manufacturers such as Namco, Konami,<br>

Luther never had the privilege or the misfortune of being able to reflect with an inner or outer distance on the historical process in upheaval. Not only was he forced to think, speak, and act in the middle of events; the facts themselves, so to speak, rained down on him, while others barreled him over. Generally, however, he retained a peculiar and surprising freedom of belief<br>

Since there is no room to extensively concentrate on case studies, this contribution should be considered as a methodological introduction to upcoming new chapters.

  Abstract: In a study of the Basseri pastoralists of southern Iran, Barth (1961) expresses some surprise regarding their lack of religious interest (they describe themselves as ‘slack Muslims’). His surprise is caused by the fact that religion seems to loom large in the lives of most of the peoples described in classic anthropological studies. This may be a major reason why religion has always been a central field of inquiry in anthropology, even if, as Evans-Pritchard (1962) once pointed out, social scientists have themselves often been indifferent or even hostile to religion.<br>

  Abstract: This book is an exploration of sociological and psycho-social theories of the construction of whiteness vis-à-vis perceptions and imaginings of otherness. It has three main aims. First, to introduce the reader to the history and theoretical unfolding of contemporary studies of whiteness in North America and Europe. Second, to explore the structural facilitating factors of these constructions, through such institutions as the state and the media. Finally, the book synthesises a psycho-social perspective to look at the underlying mechanisms which fuel social exclusion and inclusion in society. Theory is never separated from practice and the book makes full use of<br>

  Abstract: The social construction of white identity, or indeed identities in general, can offer us a real insight into how we perceive the self and others. In this chapter we argue that a psycho-social dimension goes beyond traditional analysis and allows us to understand the emotional, affective and visceral content of identity construction. Drawing on psychoanalytic ideas and concepts, we unravel the psychological dynamics involved in the construction of the white ‘we’ in relation to the otherness of the Other. Cultural identities are marked by a number of factors – ‘race’, ethnicity, gender and class to name but a few – yet the<br>

  Abstract: Bali was not an obvious next stop in Barth’s life as an ethnographer. While he would have liked to go to Vanuatu, Bali had been Wikan’s preference. One reason for Barth’s initial doubt was the fact that Bali had been studied by good anthropologists previously. Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson had been there in the 1940s, Clifford Geertz in the 1960s. The British anthropologist Mark Hobart was about to devote a lifetime of study to Bali. And there were others. Barth sensed that others had already been there and taken the prime cuts.<br>

  Abstract: From the late 1930s to the 1950s, Mexican cinema experienced its greatest era, known as the Golden Age. Many factors made possible the development of a truly national cinema at the time. For experts focusing on economics and politics, World War II was a catalyst. For those highlighting cultural and social reasons, the people involved in the movie industry were responsible for this blossoming. However, for the common Mexican and Latin American aficionado, the music, songs, and performers were the key element of the films produced. Many melodramas and comedy movies used popular music to emphasize their drama and romance,<br>

Yet there are certain social principles which have very widespread acceptance among the vast majority of Catholics in France. Usually most members of the Hierarchy endorse these principles, though they are not considered as Church dogma. In fact, they have become so generally identified with Catholicism that Catholics with different views must usually explain their reasons for going against the crowd.<br>

  Author(s) Lindner Rolf<br>
  Abstract: The traditional dilemma of anthropology as an account of the culturally different is contained in the postulate of authenticity which, explicitly or implicitly, underlies it. In this context the word ‘postulate’ should be taken quite literally: a moral demand is made of the group being investigated, that it keep as far away as possible from worldly influence, whether of an economic, social or cultural nature. Renato Rosaldo (1989) has drawn attention to the fact that for anthropologists, if they adhere to the classic norms, the groups possessing the most ‘culture’ are those that are in themselves coherent and homogeneous, and<br>

  Abstract: I take the paradox to be globally widespread. Consumers or, more commonly, spectators of others’ consumerism, see commodities replaced one after another by new ones. Yet, despite being new, each such commodity may sometimes be regarded as representing tradition and as having originated from inside the society rather than having been imported or affected by external influences. For example, local artists and craftsmen may think they know what foreign tourists want, but in fact find that their art works are bought by local people as much as and even more than by outsiders.

  Abstract: One needed to know little about Vshchizh, a settlement located in the southeast of Russia. It was situated on the right bank of the Desna river; the nearest city was Briansk; it was razed by Mongols sometime in the thirteenth century; and not far from it was a complex of kurgans, or burial mounds, which archaeologists had begun excavating in the 1840s.¹ These were some of the few facts recorded in the entry “Vshchizh” in the 1896 Brokgauz-Efron encyclopedia, which designated it an “insignificant settlement.”² Although condemned to insignificance, Vshchizh does possess some value for Russian literary history because two<br>

At first sight this omission seems understandable; in his own scholarly work Veselovsky was more interested in examining archaic drama and medieval legends than the works of his own contemporaries.

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

  Abstract: Few ideas have gained as much international attention in such a short time span as the concept of the
                  truth commission. Successful and failed initiatives to set up ad hoc panels called “truth commissions” to investigate patterns of human rights violations abound. In addition, in some countries single incidents of violence have led to calls for a commission when the facts about the event remained in the dark for decades. Two examples that come to mind are the 1985 siege and fire in Colombia’s Palace of Justice¹ and the 1994 bombing of the Israeli-Argentine Mutual Association in Buenos Aires.² Perhaps<br>

However, only a handful of studies have explored the commission

  Abstract: The sharing of the story of John 4 gives rise to a remarkable growth of insights in the text. Here, it is shown how faith itself touches the heart of the other reader and transforms the attitude toward the text. Personal experience and engagement with struggle and resistance emerge as significant hermeneutical factors for transformation. Hermeneutical courage is stimulated;<br>

  [BOX I Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt18z4hcm">The Year's Work in the Oddball Archive</a><br>
  Abstract: In the United States, even the most confidential archives become the dominion of popular culture; the more secret, the more classified or off-limits, the better. Reciprocally, all popular culture becomes archival material, finding its way into an oddball archive of one sort or another. In its perpetual accumulation of tales, artifacts, and stories about accumulating tales and artifacts, American culture enfolds itself in weirdo predilections.<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  4  In the Early Years: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt197059n">Our Bodies Are Selves</a><br>
  Author(s) Barreto Susan<br>
  Abstract: One early frosty Saturday morning in mid-December, one mom and dad were initially told that there was a 25 percent chance that their third child, a newborn baby girl, would live. This was simply due to the fact that she was born in 1973, happened to weigh 2 pounds 1 ounce, was born weeks early, and was in a hospital in rural Northwestern Illinois. Quickly realizing the situation’s seriousness, a local pediatrician suggested transporting the baby to the nearest state-run hospital with a preemie center in Peoria, Illinois.<br>

While scholars have for the most part speculated about the work’s author, my intention was to approach theFioreas an autonomous and anonymous artifact. This soon proved an impossible prospect, however, for the poem is denied both autonomy and anonymity by its literary parentage as well as its circumstantial history. Behind it lies theRoman de la Rose: the master text, the determining precedent, the French “original” transcribed into Italian. So much for autonomy, then.

  Abstract: It was a scandal, and indeed a media-driven scandal, that occurred. But wherein lay the scandal? In the abomination and dishonor of a “great philosopher” suddenly put in the stocks? Or (secondarily), in the fact that the print and broadcast press carried out a media lynching of a famous person (postmortem, to be sure) without taking the trouble to verify the sources of the accusation, as if the pleasure of disparaging the man compensated for the frustration of not understanding the thinker. Finally, one will object that it is a scandal that I devoted an entire chapter to these stories<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we learned how the Word became flesh in Jesus Christ and the ways in which this deepens our understanding of the role of the human body in preaching. While this is true, it is also obvious that in this digital age, some may assert that the Word has also now become digital. One cannot deny technology’s pervasive presence in society, including the church and its preaching. The fact of technology and its use will not be disappearing anytime soon; thus, this chapter will explore what it means to engage technologies in preaching and some of the<br>

  Introduction—Whose Bonhoeffer? from:

  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer was one of the most important thinkers of the twentieth century. His

Although far from uncontroversial, it is also clear that Bonhoeffer’s involvement in the German resistance has also been a significant factor in his appreciation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19rmcdc">Turns of Event</a><br>
  Author(s) BRÜCKNER MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: A survey of literary studies reveals a relatively sudden and now widespread fascination with all things cartographic. According to the
                  MLA International Bibliography, published essay and book titles using the word “map” and its variants increased exponentially over the past forty years. Before 1990, a total of 503 titles used the terms “map” or “mapping.” After 1990, the enthusiasm for using “ map” as the defining label grew by a factor of three (Figure 3.1). Between 2001 and 2010 the search term “map*” identified over 1,400 titles in books, essays, collections, and dissertations. A fifth of these titles—281 to<br>

  Abstract: From May 1934 to June 1937, Sofía del Valle traveled the length and breadth of the United States on a mission. Mexican Catholic officials had given del Valle two fundamental tasks. First, del Valle endeavored to sway American Catholic public opinion in favor of her coreligionists in Mexico, to convince American Catholics that their brothers and sisters to the south were suffering a kind of modern-day martyrdom, mercilessly persecuted by a faction of anticlerical leaders who had risen to power in the wake of the 1910 revolution.¹ Second, del Valle’s mission was to raise as much money as possible for<br>

  Abstract: La relación transfronteriza colombo-venezolana en los diez años de gobierno del presidente Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías ha sido tan dinámica como impredecible. Su propuesta de cambiar sustancialmente el régimen político dominante en Venezuela hasta 1998, y la decidida militancia de los gobiernos de Colombia con su sistema, son factores preponderantes en los desencuentros en la política exterior y en las relaciones entre ellos.<br>

  Abstract: La última década ha sido sinónimo de una gran paradoja en la concepción del agua dulce en Venezuela. Siendo un factor de integración social en el ámbito interno, el agua ha actuado como un elemento divisorio en sus relaciones exteriores con Colombia, a pesar de la situación de extrema interdependencia hídrica que une a ambos países.

  Abstract: Understanding can occur only within a specific context, under particular conditions, and with some guiding assumptions. A central task of critical hermeneutics is to consider these factors and address their impact. The (mostly unthematized) contextual conditions of the attempt to understand show up in many places: in the standpoint of the interpreter, in the process of interpretation, in that which is assumed to be already understood, and also, most decisively, in how the

  Abstract: Robert Jenson numbers among the world’s most influential living theologians, and his
                  Systematic Theologymay yet prove to be one of the most learned and stimulating written in English, or any language, in the last fifty years.¹ As Jenson continues to apply his breadth of knowledge to all manner of theological, ecclesial, and cultural concerns, one theme has attracted much of his energy and focus for over a decade. Indeed, the “theology of Israel” that comes to fruition in theSystematic Theologydisplays Jenson’s determination to work through the implications of a “newly demanding” confrontation with the fact of Judaism.²<br>

  Abstract: The one God of Israel who speaks and acts through Word and Spirit is intimately identified by and with Israel’s life. Can Israel’s Scripture accommodate the gospel so that it is seen that this same God, the God of Israel, speaks by Word and Spirit in and through Jesus Christ? The doctrine of the Trinity is the church’s emphatic answer to this question. In contrast to some assumptions, Jenson insists that the church’s Trinitarianism does not in fact depart from Israel’s interpretation of God.² This is to be observed in the shape of the early Christian mission where primal Trinitarianism<br>

  Book Title: The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things-A Contemporary Chinese Philosophy of the Meaning of Being<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Chad Austin<br>
  Abstract: Yang Guorong is one of the most prominent Chinese philosophers working today and is best known for using the full range of Chinese philosophical resources in connection with the thought of Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Heidegger. In The Mutual Cultivation of Self and Things, Yang grapples with the philosophical problem of how the complexly interwoven nature of things and being relates to human nature, values, affairs, and facts, and ultimately creates a world of meaning. Yang outlines how humans might live more fully integrated lives on philosophical, religious, cultural, aesthetic, and material planes. This first English translation introduces current, influential work from China to readers worldwide.<br>

  Book Title: Moments of Silence-Authenticity in the Cultural Expressions of the Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatanabadi Shouleh<br>
  Abstract: The Iran-Iraq War was the longest conventional war of the 20th century. The memory of it may have faded in the wake of more recent wars in the region, but the harrowing facts remain: over one million soldiers and civilians dead, millions more permanently displaced and disabled, and an entire generation marked by prosthetic implants and teenage martyrdom. These same facts have been instrumentalized by agendas both foreign and domestic, but also aestheticized, defamiliarized, readdressed and reconciled by artists, writers, and filmmakers across an array of identities: linguistic (Arabic, Persian, Kurdish), religious (Shiite, Sunni, atheist), and political (Iranian, Iraqi, internationalist). Official discourses have unsurprisingly tried to dominate the process of production and distribution of war narratives. In doing so, they have ignored and silenced other voices.Centering on novels, films, memoirs, and poster art that gave aesthetic expression to the Iran-Iraq War, the essays gathered in this volume present multiple perspectives on the war's most complex and underrepresented narratives. These scholars do not naively claim to represent an authenticity lacking in official discourses of the war, but rather, they call into question the notion of authenticity itself. Finding, deciding upon, and creating a language that can convey any sort of truth at all-collective, national, or private-is the major preoccupation of the texts and critiques in this diverse collection.<br>

  Author(s) BEARD MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: There is a genre of landscape painting that developed in the late sixteenth century, notably in a series of six etchings Jacques Callot drew depicting the Spanish Siege of Jeda (1624–25). We know that Callot was commissioned by the Spanish government to memorialize their victory, and this may account for its visual orientation. In the foreground we see, from behind, a cluster of warships gliding toward the shore. We see ahead of them, inland, further up the picture, their Dutch opponents, much smaller, smaller in fact than perspective requires. Perspective is distorted further still as the eye moves up<br>

  Author(s) KHORRAMI MOHAMMAD MEHDI<br>
  Abstract: In a letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway called war “the writer’s best subject.” Hemingway justified this description by saying that “[War] groups the maximum of material and speeds up the action and brings out all sorts of stuff that normally you have to wait a lifetime to get.”¹ Keeping in mind the notion of dramatic license, he was probably right. And considering the fact that in the past few centuries the Persian literary tradition has had many chances to experience this “best subject,” it is reasonable to expect that many great works of Persian war literature have been<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Literary and cultural historians typically cite Thomas More's 1516
         Utopiaas the source of both a genre and a concept. Karma Lochrie rejects this origin myth of utopianism along with the assumption that people in the Middle Ages were incapable of such thinking. InNowhere in the Middle Ages, Lochrie reframes the terms of the discussion by revealing how utopian thought was, in fact, "somewhere" in the Middle Ages. In the process, she transforms conventional readings of More'sUtopiaand challenges the very practice of literary history today.<br>

  Abstract: Utopia, for all its playful allusiveness to “no-place,” comes from someplace, or rather from some places and not others. Like the chimerical centaur, it is a complex idea composed of an assemblage of other ideas and, at the same time, it engages with and responds to historical realities. But it is also entirely new, and the fact that Thomas More coined a self-canceling name for the island and the political idea associated with it tends to function somewhat like King Utopus’s moat, cordoning off that idea from the continent from which it might have come, either directly or indirectly.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bmzn7v">Moving Images</a><br>
  Author(s) Hales Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The earliest cinema of Méliès and Lumière has more than once been likened to the current state-of-the-art interactive ‘new media’, and more specifically to non-linear interactive movies. Implicit in this observation is the fact that the sophistication of interactive movie language is awaiting the passage of time and the development of technology before it matures. It has been frequently noted that computers are still waiting for the first great visionary genius to take us into a new dimension.<br>

  Author(s) King Rob<br>
  Abstract: The

One can find them in early film manufacturer catalogues such as the 1896 Lumière sales catalogue of films shot in distant parts of the globe and organized according to country of origin. Or in early trade press attempts “to classify the film product of the world”, such asNew York Dramatic Mirror’s 1908 compilation of the “distinguishing characteristics” or “infallible ear marks” of films produced by different countries.¹ Or in early histories of the cinema’s aesthetic development, such as Léon Moussinac’sNaissance du cinéma<br>

  Abstract: Despite the seemingly uncanny pithiness of Al Jolson’s famous lines, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You ain’t heard nothin’ yet”, in 1927, speech was not new to the cinema. In fact, speech had played a substantial role in silent films for nearly two decades. Dialogue intertitles and character-written inserts allowed cinematic representations to extend beyond the pictorial exterior and into the linguistic consciousness of characters. Silent film dialogue, however, brought more than a symbolic image of individual consciousness to the cinema. Reflecting a broader social matrix of language and power, written dialogue gave voice to the cultural politics endemic<br>

  Abstract: Britain, as an imperial power, dominated the world at the end of nineteenth century. Jan Morris described it succinctly as, “the largest empire in the history of the world, comprising nearly a quarter of the landmass of the earth, and a quarter of its population”.¹ Its role as a global superpower was to assert its political and economic authority, especially in Africa and Asia. The so-called Pax Britannica (British peace) was a product of this status. It was expressed profoundly in 1900 by the fact that Britain and its global interests were defended by its navy – the largest navy in<br>

Alerted by a lack of interest in the Dutch colonies, in particular the East Indies (now Indonesia), the association’s founders conceived of the Colonial Institute as a center for the collection and study of data and objects of, and the dissemination of knowledge about, Dutch overseas territories.

  Abstract: In urban, English Canada, the First World War was a significant marker of Canadian independence, maturing into a nation after British colonial adolescence. In defense of the British motherland, Canada found its national pride. This is especially applicable to Ontario, where stalwart Loyalist patriotism and a remarkable volunteerism signaled how Toronto would eventually eclipse Montreal culturally, industrially and economically as the national metropolis, having already done so in fact in the war effort.¹ But a Toronto-centric Canadian nation would never have that metropolis as a sentimental focus, neither as the heartland of a folk or an avant-garde culture, nor even<br>

The first systematic production of films on scientific topics for a wide audience came about in England, where F.

  Abstract: ‘

Ever since the dawn of the postmodern era, however, we are constantly offered new theoretical arguments to persuade us of the plurality and the frailness of the I. It is commonplace nowadays to talk of the individual as a representational construct that is conditioned, manufactured and manipulated by language, images and society, a construct that can even be artificially portrayed. The subject, so the argument runs, emerges precisely because it issubjectedto<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades or so, a thriving cottage industry has developed dealing with the origins and genesis of fundamentalist movements around the globe. Yet the scholars, policy analysts and intelligence experts involved in this huge effort had precious little to say about why such movements survive, and even flourish at times. After all, the odds are pretty much against them, as evidenced by the fact that the membership turnover rate is high. The stringent behavioural requirements, typical of fundamentalist groups, stand in stark contrast to the anything-goes, hedonistic, open society around them. One can just pick up one’s<br>

  Author(s) Kapferer Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience. Consider the synchronic fictions of recent ethno-histories, the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbzsw">Beyond Rationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Kapferer Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The cosmologies implicated in sorcery practice are human-centric. Within them, human beings are at the heart of processes that are integral in the formation of their psychical, social and political universes. Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Chapter 10  Strange Fruit: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbzsw">Beyond Rationalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience. Consider the synchronic fictions of recent ethno-histories, the<br>

  12  What Women Really Want: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btc01f">Identity and Networks</a><br>
  Author(s) Moore Fiona<br>
  Abstract: Traditionally, social studies of factories have focused on issues of discrimination, oppression, and resistance. The earliest studies in industrial anthropology, the Hawthorne research projects, examined the ways in which workers controlled the production process against the interests of management (Baba 1986). More recently, the work of Roberts et al.,
                  Language and Discrimination(1992) focused on ways in which English managers unconsciously exclude their non-English workers through the use of language and communication, and Westwood’s (1984)All Day, Every Dayanalyses how women from a variety of ethnic origins gain empowerment against their male relatives and bosses through subversive practices.

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

  12  Ignoble Savages from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) D’SOUZA DINESH<br>
  Abstract: For the Europeans who first voyaged abroad, much of the rest of the world came as a shock for which they were poorly prepared. Early modern accounts, such as Richard Hakluyt’s sixteenth century
                  Principal Navigationsor Samuel Purchas’s seventeenth centuryPurchas His PilgrimageandHakluytus Posthumus, convey the stupefaction of the Europeans who encountered distant and unfamiliar peoples. Europeans who were even then making a transition into the modern era found themselves genuinely amazed and horrified at other cultures which appeared virtually static, confined from time immemorial in the nomadic or the agrarian stage. The consequence was that many Europeans<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) BROWN ELEANOR MARIE<br>
  Abstract: Social scientists have identified a number of features that characterize contemporary white attitudes toward blacks. First, traditional stereotypes and blatant discrimination are no longer common. Most whites, regardless of their political orientation, reject these traditional forms of discrimination. This is particularly true of white liberals who condition their behavior toward blacks on beliefs that strongly condemn traditional discrimination. Second, whites use ostensibly nonracial factors to justify any behavior that may have a disproportionate impact on blacks or could be perceived as being racist. Third, whites harbor attitudes of ambivalence toward blacks resulting in extreme positive or negative reactions. These attitudes<br>

  31  White Law and Lawyers: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) HALEWOOD PETER<br>
  Abstract: Much has been written on surrogate motherhood as an application of biotechnology which challenges conventional understandings of equality and the family. Surrogacy also challenges conventional notions of embodiment. Indeed, the law has responded to surrogacy by bracketing off the surrogate mother’s embodiment—her factual experience of pregnancy—from the legal facts relevant to deciding disputes over custody arising from surrogacy arrangements. For example, even where the so-called surrogate is pregnant with her own fertilized ovum, she is defined not as the “biological” mother but as the “surrogate” mother, thus denying the biological and experiential fact that she is the mother.<br>

  35  The Transparency Phenomenon, Race-Neutral Decisionmaking, and Discriminatory Intent from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) FLAGG BARBARA J.<br>
  Abstract: In this society, the white person has an everyday option not to think of herself in racial terms at all. In fact, whites appear to pursue that option so habitually that it may be a defining characteristic of whiteness: to be white is not to think about it.¹ I label the tendency for whiteness to vanish from whites’ self-perception the transparency phenomenon.² Because transparency is such a pervasive fact of whites’ conceptualization of ourselves, we have reason to be skeptical of ostensibly race-neutral decisionmaking by white decisionmakers. I propose that white decisionmakers adopt that deliberate skepticism as well regarding their<br>

  Author(s) LEVIT NANCY<br>
  Abstract: First,
                     Plessyoriginated, and recent decisions embrace, a concept of natural racism. This view holds that racism inheres in the human condition. Racism is innate and inevitable and, as a consequence, it must be tolerated—by the federal courts among others—as an unfortunate fact of human existence. The Constitution and the construing Court are powerless to alter the course of racial instincts; separation may not be equal, but it is entirely natural.<br>

  Abstract: Radical assessment can encompass illustration, anecdote, allegory, and imagination, as well as analysis of doctrine and cases. I want to utilize all of these techniques to comment on a contemporary phenomenon:
                     The Bell Curve. A great deal of attention and energy has been devoted to commending and condemning Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein, authors of this best-selling book on racial intelligence.

  Book Title: Religion: Beyond a Concept-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de VRIES HENT<br>
  Abstract: What do we talk about when we talk about religion? Is it an array of empirical facts about historical human civilizations? Or is religion what is in essence unpredictable-perhaps the very emergence of the new? In what ways are the legacies of religion-its powers, words, things, and gestures-reconfiguring themselves as the elementary forms of life in the twenty-first century?Given the Latin roots of the word religion and its historical Christian uses, what sense, if any, does it make to talk about religionin other traditions? Where might we look for common elements that would enable us to do so? Has religion as an overarching concept lost all its currency, or does it ineluctably return-sometimes in unexpected ways-the moment we attempt to do without it? This book explores the difficulties and double binds that arise when we ask What is religion? Offering a marvelously rich and diverse array of perspectives, it begins the task of rethinking religionand religious studiesin a contemporary world. Opening essays on the question What is religion?are followed by clusters exploring the relationships among religion, theology, and philosophy and the links between religion, politics, and law. Pedagogy is the focus of the following section. Religion is then examined in particular contexts, from classical times to the present Pentacostal revival, leading into an especially rich set of essays on religion, materiality, and mediatization. The final section grapples with the ever-changing forms that religionis taking, such as spirituality movements and responses to the ecological crisis.Featuring the work of leading scholars from a wide array of disciplines, traditions, and cultures, Religion: Beyond a Concept will help set the agenda for religious studies for years to come. It is the first of five volumes in a collection entitled The Future of the Religious Past, the fruit of a major international research initiative funded by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research.<br>

The novel, to this point, has been radically antipsychological—what use is the diagnosis of paranoia, for example, if everyone is in fact shooting at you?—and Yossarian, on Heller’s behalf, has delighted in concocting dreams to placate or frustrate psychoanalysts. But he is frightened by his one actual dream, and feels the urgency of plumbing its recesses.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary Western societies is undoubtedly the phenomenon usually referred to as the “turn to religion,” “the post-secular,” or, more generally, the “return of the religious.” What at first sight appears to be a simple return to religious values, inspired by a critical rejection of the basic assumptions of modern secular culture, is in fact a refined dialogue with this culture, a dialogue in which religious and secular arguments often change places. This delicate relationship between religion and modernity manifests itself not only in daily practical discussions about the role of religion<br>

  Abstract: There is no task more difficult than to be faithful and true to our creaturely condition. Whether out of fear, blindness, suspicion, arrogance, or rebellion, our abiding temptation is to evade, dissimulate, or distort each other and our place in the world. Rather than patiently and honestly living up to our need before others—by taking full account of, and then honoring, the breadth and depth of the relationships we live through—we deform need into fantasy and remake the world to suit our own desires.

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Author(s) Urban Hugh<br>
  Abstract: Since their first discovery of the complex body of texts and traditions known as “Tantra,” Western authors have been at once horrified and tantalized, scandalized and titillated, by this seemingly exotic form of Eastern spirituality. Above all, Western authors have been particularly obsessed with the use of sexual rituals in Tantric practice—a phenomenon that was a source of disgusted revulsion for most Christian missionaries and Orientalist scholars, even as it was a source of erotic allure for many European esoteric groups. By the end of the nineteenth century, in fact, Tantra had begun to be appropriated by various European<br>

  Abstract: For obvious reasons, sexual magic is a subject that evokes controversy and curiosity. Surprisingly, however, there exists—with the laudable exception of two works on the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and on Paschal Beverly Randolph¹—practically no critical scholarly literature that studies it as a historical phenomenon and, as a result, the information available to a wider public tends to be sensationalist, secondhand, and mostly unreliable. In this chapter we will present a factual presentation of the theories and practices of four of the most important groups and orders devoted to sexual magic in the twentieth century, based upon direct<br>

This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  THE YOGA OF SEX: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5cjzn">Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism</a><br>
  Author(s) Urban Hugh<br>
  Abstract: Since their first discovery of the complex body of texts and traditions known as “Tantra,” Western authors have been at once horrified and tantalized, scandalized and titillated, by this seemingly exotic form of Eastern spirituality. Above all, Western authors have been particularly obsessed with the use of sexual rituals in Tantric practice—a phenomenon that was a source of disgusted revulsion for most Christian missionaries and Orientalist scholars, even as it was a source of erotic allure for many European esoteric groups. By the end of the nineteenth century, in fact, Tantra had begun to be appropriated by various European<br>

  THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF SEXUAL MAGIC, EXEMPLIFIED BY FOUR MAGICAL GROUPS IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5cjzn">Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hakl Hans Thomas<br>
  Abstract: For obvious reasons, sexual magic is a subject that evokes controversy and curiosity. Surprisingly, however, there exists—with the laudable exception of two works on the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor and on Paschal Beverly Randolph¹—practically no critical scholarly literature that studies it as a historical phenomenon and, as a result, the information available to a wider public tends to be sensationalist, secondhand, and mostly unreliable. In this chapter we will present a factual presentation of the theories and practices of four of the most important groups and orders devoted to sexual magic in the twentieth century, based upon direct<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84g9z">Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts</a><br>
  Author(s) Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: Among the New Testament (NT) writings, only Luke provides an explicit account of the public ascension of Jesus. The significance of Jesus’s ascension in his writings is further accentuated by the fact that it appears in both his first and second volumes. While it is widely acknowledged that the ascension account found at the end of Luke’s Gospel serves to provide a proper conclusion to this gospel (Luke 24:50–53),¹ and the one found at the beginning of Acts serves to introduce the mission of the apostles after Jesus’s departure (Acts 1:9–11),² the programmatic significance of the ascension narrative<br>

  Abstract: The Pagan. At the time of his death in 1998 the French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard had begun writing what was to have been a substantial work on Augustine’sConfessions. In the event he has left us only fragments—notes, paragraphs,envois, sketches, and two lectures stitched together to form a kind of monograph called “La Confession d’Augustin”:theconfession, referring, as we shall see, to Augustine’s confession of his love for God.

  Abstract: One may wonder whether the doctor-patient relationship has ever succeeded in being a simple, instrumental relation that could be described in such a way that the cause and the effect, the therapeutic gesture and its result, would be directly related one to the other, on the same plane and at the same level, without being mediated by something foreign to its space of intelligibility. It is certain, in any case, that the centuries-old invocation of a

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84gs6">Writings on Medicine</a><br>
  Abstract: Understood as an event in the doctor-patient relationship, healing is at first sight what the patient expects from the doctor, but not what he always obtains from him. There is thus a discrepancy between the patient’s hope regarding the power that he attributes to the doctor on the grounds of the latter’s knowledge and the doctor’s recognition of the limits of his own efficacy. There, without doubt, lies the main reason why, of all the objects specific to medical thought, healing is the one that doctors have considered the least. Yet this is also due to the fact that the<br>

  Author(s) Spivak Gayatri Chakravorty<br>
  Abstract: Two pieces of practical advice. Like Aristotle in the
                     Poetics, Coleridge is giving advice on how to sell poetry. And Marx cautions against basing all analysis on people’s sense of things; rather one should investigate what worldly factors produce that sense. One is talking about producing a certain willingness in the readership. The other is saying that willingness is produced by material conditions bigger than the personal will. For Coleridge, the determinant is spiritual. For Marx, social. Let us call this these remote presuppositions of my argument.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) O’Connor Brian<br>
  Abstract: In Theodor W. Adorno’s philosophy, memory is analyzed as a form of knowledge that has become problematic. Adorno argues that what we can know through memory is threatened with eclipse by certain allegedly more rational forms. That eclipse, though, amounts to an act of forgetting that is, as he puts it, equivalent to a “destruction of memory.”¹ Now obviously not all events or all things can be remembered or ought to be remembered. Adorno’s considerations of the issue, in fact, pivot specifically both on the loss of
                  individualityand on the danger of forgettinghuman suffering. This places memory at<br>

  Abstract: In his contribution to the first issue of

  Abstract: Marc Bloch’s remark comes halfway through the unfinished final chapter of
                  The Historian’s Craft, on historical causation. For Bloch human consciousness is “the subject matter of history . . . reality itself.” To ask why something happened or how it happened and under what conditions is a “common law of the mind,” Bloch avers, an “instinctive need of understanding.” Historical facts are psychological facts in the sense that however “brutal” are external forces, “their action is weakened or intensified by man and his mind.” Man’s mind is not always conscious, logical, or rational, Bloch continues; it can be explained neither<br>

  Abstract: Ever since the pioneering work of Sir Frederic Bartlett, it has become commonplace to assume that the process of remembering the personal past is a reconstructive one mediated by a host of significant factors, ranging from prevailing conventions of remembering all the way to the inevitable impact of present experience on the rendering of the past.¹ The recognition of this simple and seemingly indisputable fact has become something of a double-edged sword in the conceptualization of memory. On the one hand, it has vastly expanded the field of memory studies: memory, far from being the mere videotape-like replica of the<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>

  Abstract: In this revised history, Machiavelli offers a rhetoric for dealing with the realm of de facto political power, rather than a political theory with a coherent thematic content; and Renaissance Machiavellism includes a variety of rhetorically sophisticated appreciations and appropriations of Machiavelli's own rhetorical approach to politics. Part I offers readings of
      The Prince, The Discourses,and Counter-Reformation responses to Machiavelli. Part II discusses the reception of Machiavelli in sixteenth-and seventeenth-century England. Part III focuses on Milton, especiallyAreopagitica, Comus,andParadise Lost.<br>

  FIVE  MACHIAVELLIAN DEBATES, 1530–1660 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c99bcq">Machiavellian Rhetoric</a><br>
  Abstract: WHEN Andrew Marvell sought to describe Cromwell’s troubling
                  virtùin the “Horatian Ode,” he chose a Machiavellian rhetoric of de facto political power, of terrifying natural energy whose capacity to create seemed inextricably linked to its capacity to destroy. He also imitated Machiavelli’s own rhetoric, at once dispassionate and critical, with his description of Cromwell as a man who “Could by industrious Valour climbe / To ruine the great Work of Time.” Marvell’s Machiavellian rhetoric can serve as an emblem of generations of Renaissance Englishmen who identified Machiavelli with political innovation—with ruining and remaking the great Work of Time.<br>

  4  “Both Sides and Neither”: from:

But in view of the extensive correspondence between José Rodríguez Feo and Stevens gathered together in

  Abstract: Experimental archaeology may be defined as the creation of activities and contexts in which ideas about the past can be thought through in practical terms and tested. For instance: how were artefacts made and buildings constructed; what residues are left of particular activities; and what is the capability of a boat? Experiments often mean that some parameters are controlled in order to make precise observations about others, such as the effects of time. The main syntheses of the subject were written 30 years ago or more (Coles 1973; 1979), even then it was a diverse field encompassing many distinct specialisms.<br>

Freshwater Mollusca are undoubtedly at their most valuable as part of a multi-proxy study, integrated as one of several sources of evidence.

This question has been debated vigorously among psychologists and behavioral scientists. No doubt most would conclude today that both hereditary and environmental factors are important and that both should be considered. This is also the case with the development of early Christianity, if we may employ an analogy between human growth and the historical development of a religious movement.

But if one important function of such a creed was for baptismal instruction and for profession at baptism when the convert renounced the devil and his works, and if part of Jesus’s life was in fact a battle with evil (victory’s being a fait accompli through his death and resurrection), then perhaps in the loosest terms one can see Jesus’s life suggested between<br>

The idea of peaceful cooperation, nurtured up to then by many British and American politicians and diplomats, was shattered. The last Eastern European democracy, Czechoslovakia, had been amalgamated into the Soviet camp and closed off, although, almost miraculously, Finland was released from Moscow’s grasp. Washington no longer saw Soviet control as a stabilizing factor in Eastern Europe. Instead, the restoration of independent states and the rollback of Soviet military power became the prerequisites of a secure and lasting continental peace. The goal thenceforth<br>

  Abstract: On October 23, 1956, Hungary exploded. Although it is hard to pinpoint why one country remains docile under tyrannical rule while another revolts, historians have dedicated years of research to identifying the specific factors that led to the only armed uprising against Soviet rule. Because virtually all segments of Hungarian society had suffered various forms of repression, unrest was not confined to the capital city. Centrally engineered “circular social mobility” failed to satisfy even the social groups whose aspirations the regime had privileged.¹ Grievances included foreign military occupation, state terror that sometimes exceeded even the limits of Soviet tolerance, serious<br>

  Abstract: Even though the United States had finally accepted the division of the continent on a permanent basis – and was not particularly secretive about having done so – the years of détente were coming to an end. Each side was accusing the other of violating the terms of the SALT I treaty. The Soviet Union may have been exploiting loopholes in the agreement to build superiority in the field of strategic nuclear missiles.¹ In fact, confidence between the two superpowers or indeed the two military alliances had never really taken hold.

  Abstract: The existence of evil in the world is regarded by most atheists as the principal objection to the existence of God, called by the Roman Catholic theologian Hans Küng the ‘rock of atheism’. By ‘evil’ is meant the fact of pain and suffering and the ‘problem’ that it poses for religious belief is not hard to see. How can evil exist in a world created by an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God? For the positive atheist this question exposes an insuperable inconsistency within religious belief, thereby invalidating the claim that any God exists.

  Abstract: This work will give an account of the Christian life as life in the Spirit. This should be obvious enough from the new testament witness and especially Paul’s description of the Christian life as the Spirit’s work of making people into the image of Jesus Christ. However, we should not take it for granted that we have and in fact live by such an account for two reasons. The first reason is that the kind of life Jesus lived is not taken seriously for what it means for a Christian to live a life in the Spirit, or even for<br>

  Book Title: Christian Theology and Religious Pluralism-A Critical Evaluation of John Hick<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Nah David S.<br>
  Abstract: The question of religious pluralism is the most significant yet thorniest of issues in theology today, and John Hick (1922–2012) has long been recognized as its most important scholar. However, while much has been written analyzing the philosophical basis of Hick’s pluralism, very little attention has been devoted to the theological foundations of his argument. Filling this gap, this book examines Hick’s theological attempts to systematically deconstruct the church’s traditional incarnational Christology. Special attention is given to evaluating Hick’s foundational theses “that Jesus himself did not teach what was to become the orthodox Christian understanding of him" and “that the dogma of Jesus’ two natures . . . has proved to be incapable of being explicated in any satisfactory way." By elucidating the ways in which Hick’s arguments fail, David Nah demonstrates that Hick was unwarranted in breaking away from the church’s incarnational Christology that has been at the core of Christianity for almost two thousand years.<br>

  Abstract: Having examined Hick’s thesis that Jesus never claimed to be divine but that this momentous doctrine was the creation of the church subsequent to his death, my next task is to assess his other important thesis, which I am here calling his “conceptual argument.”¹ This is the thesis that the belief in Jesus as God the Son incarnate, as articulated in the language of the two-natures Christology of Nicaea and Chalcedon, has proven to be incoherent and incapable of being explicated in any satisfactory way, and that, in fact, no adequate explanation has thus far been proposed.

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter one it was argued that an atonement motif that wished to remain faithful to Christianity would demonstrate a degree of continuity with the meaning that Jesus of Nazareth constituted for his death. That contention still stands, and our analysis of the previous chapter has brought us to the point in which we must now discuss what kind of continuity is, in fact, to be expected. How should we incorporate the meaning that Jesus created for his death into our contemporary presentations? What kind of continuity are we looking for? Are our articulations to be constrained to the categories<br>

These multicultural settings are the result of various factors, from the migration movements of large groups of people caused by economic necessity, war, oppression, displacement, and the search for better opportunities for shaping one’s life. If one wanted to write a diachronic history of the genesis of most multicultural societies, one would come across the most grievous aspects of modern history, racism, nationalism, ethnic strife, exploitation, and religious oppression, leading to the banishment<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

  Abstract: When J.E. Lesslie Newbigin retired from missionary service and returned to Britain in 1974, he discovered that his homeland was as much of a mission field as India. While he had been in constant contact with Britain and the West throughout his missionary career, what he saw upon his return ignited his missionary spirit and caused him to set out in retirement to discover the cause of the problem and propose an answer. It was not that he would discover something new; in fact, he had the answer all along but had to articulate it anew for the new context.<br>

  Abstract: Newbigin’s view of humanity is one that acknowledges human sinfulness while maintaining the value and worth of human persons as God’s creation. His methodology is to discuss Christian doctrine in dialogue with the Enlightenment and post-modern thinking. The Enlightenment sought to free humanity from the ‘ dogma’ of original sin because they believed that “the most dangerous and destructive of all the dogmas which have perverted human reason is the dogma of original sin.”¹ Enlightenment thinkers saw the significance of the doctrine of original sin as central to the whole Christian ‘system.’ If humanity is not, in fact, sinful, then<br>

  Abstract: Throughout the previous chapters, there have been numerous references to the church, usually in connection to some task or action that Newbigin believes the church must perform to confront Western culture. While the emphasis thus far has been on the substance of Newbigin’s theology in the face of the challenge of the Enlightenment ideology, it would be incorrect to conclude that what Newbigin envisions is somehow confined to mere words, as important as words are. His theology includes, in fact

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf5zz">Between Vision and Obedience - Rethinking Theological Epistemology</a><br>
  Abstract: It was Gadamer who suggested that Hegel may become more important for hermeneutics than Schleiermacher.¹ This may come as a surprise for those who know Hegel as the author of the absolute system, the “conceptual” Hegel, the philosopher who thought he could think God’s thoughts “before the creation of nature and of finite mind.”² As it is well known, immediately after his death, Hegel’s disciples divided among themselves, and the division has continued ever since, as nobody has succeeded in showing convincingly how Hegel’s system works in actual fact.<br>

  Author(s) Buchanan Colin<br>
  Abstract: [Personal: I am an Anglican liturgist from England, and I notified Tim Meadowcroft of Laidlaw that I would be in Auckland in February 2011, simply hoping to meet for a cup of coffee. However, he brought me into the theological seminar on “Lament,” to contribute from my own discipline. I was well aware of the earlier earthquake in Christchurch (I had just been there on my travels), as well as of the more tragic mining disaster on the West Coast; and the raw memories of these events were sobering factors in my preparation and presentation.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf6wd">Mothers on the Margin?</a><br>
  Abstract: A scarlet thread ties the stories of Tamar and Rahab together, as does the fact that they are both Canaanite women who use trickery to outwit men and gain control of their situation to save their lives and the lives of others. Yet, the setting to Rahab’s story is very different to Tamar’s. Her story is embedded in the account of the conquest of Canaan by the tribes of Israel led by Joshua. The Joshua narrative seeks to define boundaries, not just in terms of who lives where in the promised land but in terms of who is “in” and<br>

  CHAPTER FOUR  Social Theory and Postmodernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9s9">Christian Ethics as Witness</a><br>
  Abstract: The last two chapters have demonstrated the fact that the church, as a witnessing community, cannot rise above and live outside its surrounding society and culture. In his 1924 essay “Church and Culture,” for example, Barth writes that the church cannot give witness without conversing with the “actual political and economic standards of its own age. Throughout its own course, the Church swims along in the stream of culture” (
                  TC: 351). This does not imply, of course, that the church ought to accommodate itself to its surrounding culture, only that the church cannot “free itself even partially” from society and<br>

  I.  Gift’s Originary Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9tt">Gift and the Unity of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: Originary experience opens up a seldom pursued but uniquely fruitful path for pondering the form of the unity of being. In part because of the troubled history of the concept, and partly because of the contemporary use of the term “experience,” originary experience may seem a doubtful starting point. “Experience,” in fact, has been described as the “most deceitful” and “most obscure” of terms.¹ Nevertheless, if by originary experience we mean the engagement of the whole of our being with the whole of reality and with God, who is their innermost and transcendent center, originary experience, despite its difficulties, can<br>

  III.  Reception and Reciprocity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9tt">Gift and the Unity of Being</a><br>
  Abstract: The response of wonder before God’s communication of esse deepens when we become aware that God gives the human person, along with the capacity to stand on his own, the capacity to act out of his own being (
                  autexousia).¹ When God gives, he gives because he wants to share his giving. In fact, it would not be a real giving if God did not allow the concrete singular being to participate in his capacity to give, in his own freedom. The divine creating act goes so far that Aquinas claims that the human person is the cause of himself.² Gregory<br>

  3  Interpreting Genesis: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb0w">Allegorizing History</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapter showed that Bede did not figurally exegete events in the English Church’s history, despite frequent opportunities to do so. I will argue in this chapter that Bede’s commentary on Genesis and how he reads the creation of time, history, and the world displays a theological and philosophical ambiguity that factors into how Bede conceives of God’s action or providential caring for history and humanity. Using

  4  Anachronism and the Status of the Past in Bede’s Historia and Figural Exegesis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb0w">Allegorizing History</a><br>
  Abstract: Before transitioning to the subject for this chapter, a brief recounting of my argument to this point seems appropriate. Along with summarizing contemporary scholarship on Bede’s
                  Historiaand exegesis, Chapter 1 alluded to the fact that reading Bede in light of modern historical methods and presumptions results in distortion. Part of that discussion revolved around the status of the past and its relationship to the present. The work of Charles Jones made such issues come to the fore in my historiography, specifically Jones’s application of the categories of realist and romantic to Bede, and Jan Davidse applied such concerns to<br>

  3  Bonhoeffer’s Theology and Economic Humanism: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb5g">Being Human, Becoming Human</a><br>
  Author(s) Frick Peter<br>
  Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine Bonhoeffer’s theology vis-à-vis economics. Admittedly, at first glance, this may appear as a rather farfetched idea, since Bonhoeffer was neither trained nor known as an economist and has left us no systematic treatment of his thought on that subject. Yet, there is the curious fact that Bonhoeffer’s entire adult life unfolded within an inexorable economic downward spiral. The height of that spiral was for Bonhoeffer in all probability the granting of his doctoral degree in theology in 1927. The bourgeois élan of the Bonhoeffer family, embedded as it was in intellectual elitism<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfb5g">Being Human, Becoming Human</a><br>
  Author(s) Dahill Lisa E.<br>
  Abstract: What do we learn from Dietrich Bonhoeffer about being and becoming human? That question animating this volume of essays pushes deep into Christian anthropology, ecclesiology, social analysis, and Christology—that is to say, it invites us into the territory of the
                  body. To assert that the questions at the heart of Bonhoeffer’s thinking and witness are inherently matters of reflective Christianembodimentin the world may seem so clear as not to warrant comment; obviously humans are constituted as bodies, and anything we might say about our humanity and life together in the world must take account of that fact.<br>

  III  Transference and Countertransference Revisited from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch77tk">The Helping Relationship</a><br>
  Author(s) Meier Augustine<br>
  Abstract: During the past decade, there has been increased interest in the theoretical construct of countertransference. Attempts have been made to broaden its meaning to include all of the therapist’s feelings toward the client, in therapy and beyond therapy, and not to limit its meaning to the expression of the therapist’s unconscious and conflicted feelings as a reaction to a client’s transference. To better appreciate this trend, it is essential to revisit the concept of countertransference and to ascertain its original meaning, see how it has evolved over time, and consider the factors that have contributed to its modification.<br>

  Author(s) Morrison Bradley T.<br>
  Abstract: Spiritual care is rapidly replacing pastoral care in institutional settings. While the assumptions of spiritual counselling may be a better fit for hospitals, nursing homes, and counselling centres, the pastoral paradigm remains the better fit for congregational care. This chapter argues that the pastoral paradigm provides a productive framework for addressing developments in the field of pastoral care and congregational ministry. The chapter correlates the psychotherapy outcome research of the common factors model with features of the pastoral paradigm to identify the ways in which the pastoral paradigm leverages the relational and communal dimensions of congregational life.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch782p">Multiculturalism and Integration</a><br>
  Author(s) PETERMAN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: If Canadians today think back to the decade before Confederation, they do so with precious little interest or curiosity. Yet, it was a complicated and fiery prelude to that period of developing Canadian nationhood, a vexed and contradictory era, marked by religious pressures, shifting political alliances, much tentativeness and a climate of financial uncertainty. Powerful national, religious and ethnic agendas were at work before the gaze of an anxious and sometimes violent public. If, for instance, one were Irish-born and living in Canada, one’s position on the possibility of “confederation” depended upon many factors—whether one was Catholic or Protestant,<br>

  Abstract: Il n’est pas aisé de définir la santé. Les définitions ont évolué dans le temps en fonction des approches adoptées. La définition la plus connue est celle de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), qui stipule que « la santé est un état de complet bien-être physique, mental et social, et ne consiste pas seulement en une absence de maladie ou d’infirmité » (<www. who.int/suggestions/faq/fr/>). Pour définir la santé, l’OMS fait ainsi référence à la notion de bien-être, considéré comme la satisfaction des besoins et l’accomplissement des capacités physiques, intellectuelles et spirituelles.

  Abstract: This is not an academic paper but a story with academic interest. It is the story of a book collector who particularly collected the books of Robertson Davies and who contacted him to ask if he would sign some books. From this grew an acquaintance of eight years and from that acquaintance came a correspondence in which that highly encyclopaedic among modern writers began to ask the book collector, who happened to be a physician-my physician, in fact-if he could provide answers to some unusual medical questions.<br>

  Author(s) Kerszberg Pierre<br>
  Abstract: Ever since the rise of the modern exact sciences, it has become more and more clear that the scientific mind is not bound by an exhaustive understanding of its own doings. The fact is that, while discovering the inner structure or the nexus of relations pertaining to an object, science ignores the paths that led to this structure or these relations; but these paths lie precisely at the basis of the ontological ground of the object. Husserl reflected on this legacy of the scientific revolution when he argued that “it is not always natural science that speaks when natural scientists<br>

  Abstract: Arguably one of the most difficult tasks of philosophy is to grasp where we are today. While undoubtedly this has something to do with the usual biases of the day, in that philosophers are as surely bound by mundane prejudices as everyone else, it also seems to derive from a factor peculiar to philosophy. It is no accident that philosophers have long dealt with the question of the good life. Philosophers have always wanted to leave the cave. Whether or not one fashions the departure in grand metaphysical terms, one can maintain, with fairly adequate justification, that a defining characteristic<br>

  Abstract: One of the fundamental assumptions of the liberal tradition of democracy, and so of the institutions nourished explicitly or implicitly by that tradition, is that there are a plurality of values that can conflict with one another and that are not reducible to one another.

La majorité des écrits portant sur le sujet repose essentiellement sur une conception technique de la science et de ses méthodes.

  Abstract: The question of thinking and living in the New World began, for the British in Acadia, with a problem of continuity of place. Fundamentally, theirs was the problem of imagining continuity where there was none. Complicating the issue, however, was the fact that a great many British settlers were possessed of a sense of identity that had been in some measure disfigured and that they were consequently trying to recover. In most cases, the identity that they sought to preserve was of British origin.<br>

  Book Title: Europe et traduction-  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): Ballard Michel<br>
  Abstract: La traduction est un phénomène central pour l'Europe telle qu'elle est en train de se construire : elle assure les échanges entre états sans qu'une langue commune donne l'impression d'une hégémonie quelconque ou d'un abandon des identités nationales. Cet attachement à la notion d'identité tout en ménageant les échanges culturels est une constante de l'histoire européenne et ces échanges passées, fondés sur la traduction, font que la construction de l'Europe ne se réduit pas à la création d'une entité économique et politique : elle possède une dimension humaine et culturelle spécifique, qui lui donne son âme. Ce colloque a abordé ces deux aspects du rôle de la traduction en Europe : dans le passé et aujourd'hui comme facteur de découverte mutuelle et ferment culturel ; de manière plus spécifique aujourd'hui comme facteur d'équilibre et instrument de communication au sein des institutions. Le colloque a rassemblé des spécialistes de nombreux pays européens ou observateurs jetant un regard sur l'Europe. Les textes partent de la traduction en Irlande au Moyen Age pour aboutir aux traducteurs allemands de Roumanie au XIXe siècle. La dernière partie du colloque tente de faire le point sur divers aspects de la recherche en matière de traductologie ainsi que la formation des traducteurs.<br>

  Abstract: The passion narrative—recounting the last days of Jesus’s life—has the greatest continuity and overlap between the four canonical Gospels, including the Gospel of John. In fact, nearly half of John’s close parallels with Mark and the other Synoptics can be found in John 18–19, tracing the events from the arrest of Jesus to his burial. When the larger outline of parallels between John and the three Synoptic Gospels regarding the last days of Jesus is listed, the particulars are impressive. Therefore, the passion narratives of the Gospels serve as a fitting place to begin when investigating glimpses<br>

  Abstract: The works of Jesus are described in a number of ways in the canonical Gospels. Some of them are common to John and the Synoptics, while others are only in the Synoptics or only in John. John’s riddles include the fact that many of the Synoptic features of Jesus’s works are missing from John: Jesus’s baptism, his temptation in the wilderness, calling twelve disciples, exorcisms, healing lepers and women, dining with sinners, tax collectors, and Pharisees, sending out disciples on service trips, ministering in Nazareth, feeding the four thousand, the transfiguration on the mount, and making a long and momentous<br>

  Abstract: Despite the fact that the Fourth Gospel was finalized in a Hellenistic setting, its cultural background and thought forms remain thoroughly Jewish.¹ Recognizing Semitic terms and syntax within the Johannine narrative provides a distinctive window into the Evangelist’s presentation of Jesus. While scholars have tended to assume with varying degrees of certainty that none of the Evangelist’s words go back to the historical Jesus, the presence of this Semitic material nonetheless requires an accounting for its origin. Such an inquiry cannot claim to verify a primitive recollection of the Galilean rabbi within the memory of Johannine tradition, yet it still<br>

The immanent approach insists, instead, that the event is graspable as it takes place, that it is a fact unfolding among or between its declared historical elements, a real undetermined movement of flight, what Nancy calls “thethatitself of the ‘that-it-happens.’”¹ To<br>

  Abstract: Structuralism, whatever that term may mean over a decade into the twenty-first century, is overdue for reassessment. The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Abstract: As a writer who bridged the sciences and the humanities, Eiseley is a challenge for scholars locked into rigid disciplinary boundaries.
      Artifacts and Illuminations, the first full-length collection of critical essays on the writing of Eiseley, situates his work in the genres of creative nonfiction and nature writing. The contributing scholars apply a variety of critical approaches, including ecocriticism and place-oriented studies ranging across prairie, urban, and international contexts. Contributors explore such diverse topics as Eiseley's use of anthropomorphism and Jungian concepts and examine how his work was informed by synecdoche. Long overdue, this collection demonstrates Eiseley's continuing relevance as both a skilled literary craftsman and a profound thinker about the human place in the natural world.<br>

Translators needed to create the tools for translation, such as dictionaries, still a difficult undertaking today. Although the fact that many Native languages do not share even the same structures or classes of words as European languages has always made translation difficult, translating cultural values and perceptions into the idiom of another culture renders the process even more difficult.<br>

For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  3  Hauntings as Histories: from:

  Author(s) THRUSH COLL<br>
  Abstract: Another way to frame this question is to ask whether places—physical locations and the multiple human histories embedded in them—have distinct identities and are capable of agency. Can a single place be home to a certain kind of history, persistent and cohesive, even across boundaries of time and cultural regime? Can the nonhuman, in the form of organisms, climate, or other entities, define the shape of a place and even its meaning? Can remnants of past societies—ruins, ecological footprints, artifacts—“speak” in active ways for the histories they represent? And can we include<br>

  Author(s) MCCONVILLE J. G.<br>
  Abstract: In Matthew 1:23 we read: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called immanuel” (RSV), in a formula that is immediately recognizable as a central element in Christian liturgy and theology about Jesus Christ. There are curiosities about the passage, not only in its announcement of a virgin birth, but also in the fact that the child that is born is called not immanuel, but Jesus, a first indication (in our present enquiry) that texts do not necessarily say exactly what they mean.

  Abstract: Charles Ball had been a family man, a skilled worker. From his cabin on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, he had seen a brighter future. True, he was enslaved, like his wife and children. Yet in 1805, men with his intelligence and drive were finding ways to buy their freedom from enslavers in Mary land’s tobacco districts. But on this morning, when a blaring horn jerked him out of sleep before dawn, he sat up in a loft bed at the top of a cabin 500 miles to the south-west, and he was no longer who he had been.

  Abstract: So far I have discussed conventional kinship organization among the Grecanici, based predominantly on sharing the same blood. Alongside blood kin, further lines of relatedness are pursued that create equally strong politicized links between the related parties, thus forming dense networks for minority governance. This chapter discusses

Civil society factions are predominantly based on friendship, godparenthood, and kinship, creating an ultra-dense matrix for claims to national and international resources available for the governance of the linguistic minority.

  Book Title: Useful Fictions-Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): AUSTIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a "useful fiction," a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual one. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examples-from the Bible to
      One Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo Exit-Austin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processes-and, perhaps, the very origins of literature.<br>

They ask questions such as: How can women successfully re-territorialize their violated bodies within the intimate spaces from which they have been exiled? How can they overcome linguistic limitations in expressing pain? Beyala sees linguistic violence as<br>

Cultural and intellectual life are usually nourished and often sustained by this circulation of ideas, and whether it takes the form of acknowledged or unconscious influence, creative borrowing, or wholesale appropriation, the movement of ideas and theories from one place to another is both a fact of life and a usefully enabling condition of intellectual activity.” Edward Said’s words suggest how ideas and theories travel or are borrowed and used in different places for different purposes: “For<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: While verbal expressions, whether oral or written, sometimes fail to convey all that we wish to, and as precisely as we want to, this is seldom viewed as a limitation inherent in language itself. More often than not, it is attributed, with some justification, to a lack of adequate skills on the part of the speaker or author. Just as often, the fact that theoretical expressions in the social sciences are linguistically mediated is something that is taken for granted and regarded as unproblematic, while it is in the conceptual framework of the theory being considered that the source of<br>

  Author(s) Pérez Pedro M. Guibovich<br>
  Abstract: Read, glossed, cited, and paraphrased, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s
                  Royal Commentaries(1609) have enjoyed enormous acclaim from readers since their first appearance at the beginning of the seventeenth century.¹ The existence of numerous translations into most modern languages proves their success in Europe. Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, my reading of Agnon’s
                  A Simple Storyended with emphasis on the closing dialogue between Hirshl and Mina. While it is true that, in the narrator’s words, “Hirshl and Mina’s story is over,” the novel itself does not conclude with their dialogue. In fact, instead of granting the reader a sense of closure, the novel ends with the narrator’s statement that Bluma’s story isnotover. The narrator also promises the reader that “everything that happened to Bluma Nakht would fill another book.”¹ This promise, however, was never fulfilled.

  Abstract: Even a superficial reading of the Gospels will suffice to convince the reader that incarnation is the alpha and—as resurrection of the flesh—the omega of Christian faith. And with the body, involvement in the human world and its history is part of God’s self-revelation in his Word through the Spirit. The Christian community, whose faith is corporeal, communicative, communitarian, and sacramental, participates in this involvement. None of its activities is possible in the ether of incorporeal ghosts or spirits. All prophecies and fulfillments are facts of language; the entire liturgy is visible, tactile, and resounding; rituals have the<br>

  Abstract: It is a fact that gives one pause for consideration that in Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, South America, and the United States the work of Emmanuel Levinas has found its greatest readership among Christian philosophers and theologians. Although this work is supported by a long Jewish tradition—even in its strictly philosophical elements—it has impressed many Christians by its orientation, which, despite its great originality, seems familiar to them.¹<br>

  Abstract: Narratives need time to tell their stories. In fact, without time, a narrative is not a narrative. This is because in order to tell a story, the storyteller must relay to the hearer or reader at least one process or event. For example, “Everett” is not a narrative. “Everett walks” is not much of a narrative, though the present tense “walks” in English implies a motion that occurs in time. A better narrative would be, “Everett drove the car to the store, picked up groceries, and came home.” This is the beginning of a “real” narrative because it entails multiple<br>

  Author(s) Robb John<br>
  Abstract: One of the most amazing objects in any European museum is a painted clay statue on display in Nicosia which shows a woman with a baby emerging upside down from her vagina. It is probably the only representation in all of European prehistory which shows a woman actually giving birth — a mind-boggling fact when one considers, as Mark Twain remarked, that being born is one of the few universal human experiences. And this thought-provoking find is not alone. From the golden face masks of Mycenae to the unparalleled youths and processing women in the Akrotiri frescoes — so unlike anything in<br>

  Author(s) Zeman-Wiśniewska Katarzyna<br>
  Abstract: Coroplastic studies concerning figures and figurines have developed as a distinct, very vibrant and dynamic field of archaeological research.¹ Terracotta figures and figurines, especially anthropomorphic ones, are fascinating in the way they bring us
                  face to facewith the past, and have provoked numerous discussions concerning social structures, ancient religions, and even prehistoric models of beauty. Scholars have suggested that artefacts, including figures and figurines, should not be studied, as they are still often presented in museums, standing alone, extracted from their environment, visible only en-face and untouchable (Brumfiel 1996; Hamiltonet al.1996; Bailey 2005; Zonou-Herbst 2009).

  Author(s) Webb Jennifer M.<br>
  Abstract: Archaeologists routinely consider artefacts in relation to other artefacts and use relationships of similarity and difference to create typologies and organise material culture into chronological or geographical entities (Jones 2007, 143). In this paper I propose instead to focus on the relationship between artefacts and people and ask whether different material assemblages reflect differently embodied lives in Early Bronze Age Cyprus (EBA hereafter) (on the existence of embodied individuals in prehistory and a review of the literature, see Knapp and van Dommelen 2008 and Knapp 2010).<br>

  Author(s) Aulsebrook Stephanie<br>
  Abstract: Vessels manufactured from metal appear in a geographically-wide distribution of Late Bronze Age deposits across the southern Greek mainland,
                  c.1700–1200 BC, although they remain relatively rare in the archaeological record. Their decoration required additional crafting time, labour and skill, altering their appearance and changing the interactions between the individual user, the vessel, and other participants within their context of use. Much emphasis has been placed within the discipline of archaeology on the communicative aspects of material culture (cf. Shanks and Tilley 1987, 97, 117; Kenoyer 2000, 91; for a more nuanced approach Meskell 2005, 2), but less attention<br>

  Author(s) Georgiou Giorgos<br>
  Abstract: This paper focuses on the fact that picrolite, an indigenous stone that was extensively used during the Chalcolithic period (4000/3900–2500/2400 BC) for the manufacture of small figurines and other symbolic artefacts, was used in the Early and Middle Cypriot periods (2400–1700 BC) for the production of pendants in new forms. Although the relatively limited number and contextual information available for Bronze Age objects leaves little opportunity to consider in detail how they were perceived by their makers and wearers, they can nevertheless be used to give insights into their significance and the way in which they embodied identity<br>

  Author(s) Christakis Kostis<br>
  Abstract: The application of marks on pottery during the manufacture and before the firing of a pot is a widespread practice in both the archaeological and ethnographic records of a range of different cultural milieus. Given that the mark was applied before the firing process, it is generally agreed that it is the potter who was responsible for marking the pot. Discussions so far have focused exclusively on the function and meaning of these marks. Most scholars relate them to potters and/or workshops (

  Book Title: Marxism and Form-20th-Century Dialectical Theories of Literature<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): SARTRE JEAN-PAUL<br>
  Abstract: For more than thirty years, Fredric Jameson has been one of the most productive, wide-ranging, and distinctive literary theorists in the United States and the Anglophone world. Marxism and Form provided a pioneering account of the work of the major European Marxist theorists--T. W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Ernst Bloch, Georg Lukács, and Jean-Paul Sartre--work that was, at the time, largely neglected in the English-speaking world. Through penetrating readings of each theorist, Jameson developed a critical mode of engagement that has had tremendous in.uence. He provided a framework for analyzing the connection between art and the historical circumstances of its making--in particular, how cultural artifacts distort, repress, or transform their circumstances through the abstractions of aesthetic form.<br>

  Abstract: In 2011, the American Dialect Society voted to make “occupy” the 2011 Word of the Year, defeating contenders such as “tebowing,” “99%,” and the acronym FOMO, for “fear of missing out” (anxiety over being inundated by the information on social media). The chair of the Dialect Society’s New Words Committee was quick to acknowledge that “occupy” was, in fact, “a very old word,” but noted that “over the course of just a few months it took on another life and moved in new and unexpected directions.”³ When a column on this topic appeared in

This coherence can be seen for example in the fact thatBiblique, likeTexacoandSolibo, opens in the debased contemporary present, and then projects back in time, uncovering a more vital, if painful, Creole past.

In fact, since Adorno’s early works of the 1930s up to his mature works of the 1960s, nature seems to represent what has been systematically repressed in the course of civilization. Hence, if observed from a dialectical point of view and expressed in somehow Pinkfloydian terms, nature appears as something like “the dark side of the truth” (or, in a more Springsteenian fashion, the “darkness” that lies “at the edge of<br>

  Abstract: Consumption provides us with many important challenges now. The contemporary facts of consumption urge us to rethink the ethics and politics of it.² Concern with political consumerism tends to argue how appropriate consumption linked to life-style politics can have a politically significant critical function. But there are two related problems with such a contemporary approach to consumption. First, it is concerned with consumption without relating it to production, and second, the politics of consumption in the practice of political consumerism is not accompanied by a project of ethics. The present chapter seeks to rethink the politics and ethics of consumption<br>

  Abstract: In Mozambique one is often told things about albinos that can hardly be interpreted at face value.¹ These are not, properly speaking, fictionalized narratives of a connected series of events, but rather they are evidence of propositional attitudes pertaining to refer to statements of fact, that is, they are ‘beliefs’. Although they are not told to you as ‘lies’, the fact is that the people who narrate them are often uncertain as to whether they are true. Upon hearing them, I was immediately challenged by the following question: if these beliefs do not meet up with the test of disbelief,<br>

  Abstract: In 1987, a theoretical book that had been co-written by the sociologist Luc Boltanski and the economist and statistician Laurent Thévenot appeared in an obscure, poorly distributed collection of the Presses Universitaires de France.

  Author(s) Rahkonen Keijo<br>
  Abstract: This chapter makes a comparison, which from a sociological perspective might appear a little surprising: it is between Pierre Bourdieu’s and Friedrich Nietzsche’s respective conceptions of ‘power’ and ‘taste’. The aim is to show that there is an interesting resemblance between the two with regard to these conceptions in general, and to ‘struggle for power’, ‘ressentiment’ and ‘will to power’ in particular, and thus to shed light on some key aspects of Bourdieu’s thinking. The order of the
                  dramatis personaein this analysis is no accident: Bourdieu and Nietzsche. This alludes to the fact that the discussion that follows is<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will examine the question of whether Bourdieu’s social theory can be mobilised to understand our recent and ongoing global economic crisis. This may seem an odd question to pose on many fronts, not least because – and with the exception of markets for normatively defined cultural goods¹ – Bourdieu’s corpus is rarely, if ever, called upon to engage with strictly economic processes and formations.² And this is the case despite the fact that Bourdieu (2005 [2000]) dedicated a whole volume to the study of the social structures of the economy and despite the fact that in his later,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gxxq00">The Vision of the Priestly Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: A vital factor in any attempt to interpret Pg as a whole is the question of its nature or genre.¹ However, how exactly to describe the nature of the Priestly material (Pg) has proven to be an elusive task. The Priestly material has been described in various ways; it has been described as “
                     Geschichte,” and specific nuances of this such as “Geschichtserzählung” or “Ursprungsgeschichte,” as “historiography,” and as “history viewed in ritual categories.”² It has also been described in terms of “paradigm,” whether as comprising “fundamental paradigmatic constellations” or being described as “paradigmatic” narrative, “paradigmatic history,” or “myth.”³<br>

Des recherches de type explo ratoire ont décrit les portraits de ces enseignants (Balleux, 2006, 2011) et leur cheminement professionnel (Boucher, 2004). D’autres recherches qualitatives ont mis en lumière les facteurs d’attrition des enseignants en FP (Loignon, 2006), le processus de construction d’une double identité professionnelle (Gaudreault, 2011) et le rôle des valeurs dans cette construction identitaire (Gagné, 2015).

  Abstract: The fact is that the so-called european civilization—“Western” civilization—as it has been shaped by two centuries of bourgeois rule, is incapable of solving the two major problems to which its existence has given rise: the problem of the proletariat and the colonial problem; that europe is unable to justify itself either before<br>

  Author(s) RODNEY WALTER<br>
  Abstract: Black Power is a doctrine about black people, for black people, preached by black people. I’m putting it to my black brothers and sisters that the color of our skins is the most fundamental thing about us. I could have chosen to talk about people of the same island, or the same religion, or the same class—but instead I have chosen skin color as essentially the most binding factor in our world. In so doing, I am not saying that is the way things ought to be. I am simply recognizing the real world—that is the way things<br>

  Author(s) HODGE MERLE<br>
  Abstract: The man-woman relationship is nowhere a straightforward, uncomplicated one—it is always perhaps the most vulnerable, the most brittle of human relationships. And in the caribbean this relationship has been adversely affected by certain factors of our historical development, notably, I think, by the legacy of violence and disruption with which our society has never adequately come to terms.<br>

  Does Race Antipathy Serve Any Good Purpose? (1914) from:

  Author(s) DU BOIS W. E. B.<br>
  Abstract: The difficulty with this theory is that it does not square with the facts: race antipathy is not instinctive but a matter of careful education. Black and white children play together gladly and know no prejudice until it is implanted precept upon precept and by strong social pressure; and when it is so implanted it is just as strong in cases where there is no physical difference as it<br>

  Author(s) HOOKS BELL<br>
  Abstract: We live in a world in crisis—a world governed by politics of domination, one in which the belief in a notion of superior and inferior and its concomitant ideology—that the superior should rule over the inferior—affects the lives of all people everywhere, whether poor or privileged, literate or illiterate. Systematic dehumanization, worldwide famine, ecological devastation, industrial contamination, and the possibility of nuclear destruction are realities which remind us daily that we are in crisis. Contemporary feminist thinkers often cite sexual politics as the origin of this crisis. They point to the insistence on difference as that factor<br>

  Author(s) Cariou Warren<br>
  Abstract: When we think of Aboriginal people in the context of fuel, one common image is of Aboriginal protestors voicing resistance to energy projects like PIPELINES, DAMS, and uranium mines. One reason for the prevalence and the visibility of such protests is that Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by energy megaprojects—in fact, it is difficult to find a megaproject that has
                  notdisplaced indigenous people or in some way threatened their cultural and physical survival. This situation can hardly be accidental.

  Abstract: 2. Capitalism’s success can be measured by how effectively it has erased the myriad possibilities of the future, how well its a version of the future is accepted as natural, given, inevitable. In extremis, the capitalist narrative blots out all alternative futures. De facto, it must contend with alternative futures proposed by social and political opposition, science fiction, and utopic literature. However, the de facto experiences of toothless alternatives only work to reinforce<br>

  Abstract: There is something unsettling about the world of Big Oil, not least the overwhelming intellectual vertigo it produces. Secrecy, guardedness, defensiveness, and corporate ventriloquism are hallmarks of the industry. Despite its technical expertise and scientific sophistication—drilling in deep water is like putting someone on the moon, oil mavens like to say—there is a startling degree of inexactitude, empirical disagreement, and lack of (or lack of confidence in) basic data. Why are the simplest facts of the oil world so vague, opaque, and elastic? Epistemological murkiness greets seemingly mundane, banal questions of how much oil there actually is and<br>

  Author(s) Stoekl Allan<br>
  Abstract: Urban ecology proposes the study of
                     alllife in cities, considered not as supremely autonomous human artifacts but rather as ecologies: sites of the interdependence of living things, flora and fauna of all types (Douglas et al. 2011). Urban life is the aggregate lives of all beings and their modes of survival and flourishing. Human life is certainly a function of urban ecology, but so is rodent life, bird life, earthworm life, canine life, and bedbug life.<br>

  Abstract: This treatise on theological anthropology works off of five presuppositions. The first is that
                  it is based on a search for unity and integrity. As we inquire into human identity, we commonly experience a wearying sense of complexity and incertitude. However, this does not mean that our explanation of human nature and of the human person need be involved or complicated. In fact, anthropology seeks above all a once-off, simple, unitary, integrated explanation of human identity. The search for truth, in fact, is always a search for unity, for simplicity, for harmony, for coherence. In other words, in order to<br>

  Abstract: Scripture does not have a developed and systematic anthropology. Yet both Testaments speak of the human being in a wide variety of ways.³ This is especially so in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, which recounts the creation of the universe, the first stage of the Covenant that God established with his people and with humanity as a whole regarding its origin, its life, its Fall, and the promise of salvation. The fact that these texts are situated at the very beginning of scripture, though they are not the earliest ones of the Old Testament, is not without significance.<br>

  Abstract: Since the mid–nineteenth century at least, Ireland has appeared in American culture somewhat as it does on “The Surrealist Map of the World”—larger than life and severely distorted. Most imported Irish cultural elements have, historically, been systematically mediated through mass cultural forms; that is, they have entered into American consciousness as artifacts of commodity culture. That this has been occurring for at least 150 years is clear from recent research into the tourism industry in Ireland, which has been promoting itself actively since the end of the Great Famine. Less researched, however, is what lies behind or motivates<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

Among humanities-based scholars, those with a stake in this area include sociologists, historians, literary critics, art historians, and anthropologists, while outside of the humanities, psychologists, neuroscientists and biologists all have the potential to contribute valuably to the field. The net cast by memory studies is so wide, in fact, that in forums like the journal
                  Memory Studies(established in 2008), attention is often paid to describing the useful limits of a field that<br>

  1  Memory and History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1w050">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) MISZTAL BARBARA A.<br>
  Abstract: Paradoxically, despite the fact that contemporary society is commonly conceptualized as “terminally ill with amnesia” (Huyssen 1995, 1), memory has established itself as a major discourse; interest in memory in the last thirty years has been unprecedented. This interest accounts for the discovery of ethnic and local roots as well as for the construction of common pasts to bind communities and give meaning to their collective fates. The intensification of a memory discourse can be illustrated by the epidemics of public commemoration, the growing recognition of memory as both a constitutive component of political culture and an important base of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1w050">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) THUENTE MARY HELEN<br>
  Abstract: The harp image encompasses distinct and sometimes conflicting iconographical histories and cultural “memories” that influenced the complex formation of Irish identity. Long recognized as an iconic site of Irish identity, the harp is also a palimpsest of cultural memory. The origins of the harp icon’s meanings extend well beyond Ireland and can be traced to a variety of ancient and modern sources, in fact and in cultural memory.

  Author(s) MATHEWS P. J.<br>
  Abstract: It is curious that the subject of “Synge and Parnell” has received very little critical attention, despite the many compelling reasons for throwing these two giants of Irish culture and politics into relief. Among these one could list the shared experience of being prominently unconventional Anglo-Irish gentlemen at pivotal moments in Irish history; their courting of international controversy over matters of sexual morality; the divisive nature of the legacies of both men; and the Wicklow connection. Of further significance is the fact that both of them loom large in the cultural memory of the Irish Revival as expressed in the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1w050">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) CREGAN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  15  Multiculturalization and Irish National Memory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1w050">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) RYAN LORRAINE<br>
  Abstract: Irish cultural memory was, until recently, a monolithic entity, constituted of exclusively “Irish” experiences such as the Famine, the war of independence, emigration, and the symbiotic relationship of church and state, while its
                  lieux de mémoireconsisted of the churches and shrines that dotted the Irish landscape and the ballads that extolled the bravery of heroes such as Sean Treacy and Dan Breen. Despite the fact of significant minority populations in Ireland,¹ this “national” memory centered on white Catholics and was thus a highly biased narrative that implicitly ignored minority experience. However, Ireland’s recent multiculturalism and the iconoclasm of the<br>

  Book Title: Placing Aesthetics-Reflections on the Philosophic Tradition<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wood Robert E.<br>
  Abstract: Examining select high points in the speculative tradition from Plato and Aristotle through the Middle Ages and German tradition to Dewey and Heidegger,
      Placing Aestheticsseeks to locate the aesthetic concern within the larger framework of each thinker's philosophy.In Professor Robert Wood's study, aesthetics is not peripheral but rather central to the speculative tradition and to human existence as such. In Dewey's terms, aesthetics is "experience in its integrity." Its personal ground is in "the heart," which is the dispositional ground formed by genetic, cultural , and personal historical factors by which we are spontaneously moved and, in turn, are inclined to move, both practically and theoretically, in certain directions.Prepared for use by the student as well as the philosopher,Placing Aestheticsaims to recover the fullness of humanness within a sense of the fullness of encompassing Being. It attempts to overcome the splitting of thought, even in philosophy, into exclusive specializations and the fracturing of life itself into theoretical, practical, and emotive dimensions.<br>

  I  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j7x66b">Placing Aesthetics</a><br>
  Abstract: There is surely sense to the notion that one ought to approach every study in terms of empirical acquaintance with the objects of the study. In fact, how else could one begin? Thus in approaching matters aesthetic, one should have firsthand acquaintance with art objects as well as with the beauties of nature and, if possible, with artistic practice. We are surely not exempt from that requirement. However, every study except philosophy begins with certain presuppositions which it is not the task of that study to analyze. Thus Euclidean geometry takes its point of departure from the possibility of beginning<br>

  Abstract: The term “inculturation” or “enculturation” was originally coined by sociocultural anthropologists to refer to the process by which individuals acquire their culture as members of a human society. Subsequently, “inculturation” was appropriated by mission theologians to refer to the evangelization of culture, the process by which the Gospel illuminates and transforms culture, while culture reexpresses and even—to a certain extent—reinterprets the Gospel. Joseph Masson, SJ, first used the term in this way in 1962, but it came into current usage in the 1970s, after the earlier terms “adaptation” and “incarnation” were deemed missiologically unsatisfactory. The most important influence<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will address a widespread feature of narratives in the OT that I believe further confirms not only of the Principle of Redemptive Withdrawal but also of the previously discussed Principle of Cruciform Accommodation. It concerns the curious fact that biblical authors frequently depict God engaging in acts of violence that their own narratives and/or the broader canon make clear God merely allowed. I will refer to this as Scripture’s “dual speech pattern.” I will argue that by acknowledging that God merely allowed the actions they elsewhere ascribe directly to God, these OT authors confirm both that<br>

  Abstract: THE UNDERLYING working hypothesis of all cognitive approaches to narrative, as I understand it, is that narrative is natural, in the sense that it arises spontaneously among all human groups, across eras and cultures, and that wherever and whenever it occurs it displays similar features. Its ubiquity and longevity are explained by the fact that it reflects fundamental categories and processes of human cognition and experience.

  Abstract: That prosopopoeic synecdoche for spectral legions of amateur researchers of independent means, the “elderly gentleman of scientific attainments” with whom we concluded the previous chapter, is associated with light and with illumination, in several ways. The first association has to do with literal light. As we have seen, the empirical fact of its appearance is separated from the misinterpretation that arises from it. This separation leads to a moment of epistemological enlightenment, however dubious or risible this may appear to the reader through the focus offered by Boz. This in turn survives beyond the event to become a scientific “paper”<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kk665x">Revelation and Convergence</a><br>
  Author(s) Garavel Andrew J.<br>
  Abstract: “Parker’s Back,” which Flannery O’Connor wrote as she was dying at the age of thirty-nine, is a story of conversion in which God’s grace overwhelms the title character, O. E. Parker, after years of wandering, denial, and dissatisfaction. The present reading points out significant affinities between this narrative and the conversion of St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430) recounted in his
                  Confessions, a text that exerts a considerable influence on O’Connor’s story.¹ “Parker’s Back,” in its author’s words, “dramatiz[es] a heresy” that figures importantly in Augustine’s work.² In addition, the theory of illumination set forth inThe Confessionscan help<br>

  Abstract: The dissimulation of exertion at the center, whether of kingdoms, of villages, or even of families, is necessary to maintain impressions of a respected figure’s potency and prestige. It is in terms of this conception (of what might be called the dissembled center), that I wish to discuss the roles of the sponsors and the dhalang at a ritual celebration. The important and problematic fact about these events is that they are occasions in which “the center” is occupied by two such different kinds of central figures: the ritual’s sponsors and the dhalang.

  Abstract: Javanese accounts of submission to a king exaggerate the notion of his beneficent berkah to the point of seeing m it a deeply satisfying influence. It is still threatening, however, in fact all the more so, and both the pleasure and the threat can be described as a kind of forgetfulness.

  Abstract: In the last two chapters, we have seen that there is a progression from the ontological conditions of myth as language to more functional terms for its existence. Mythicity may be revealed in the play of language, but it is also a systematic attempt to grasp the world as fact and metaphor, as a synchronic and diachronic whole. We can see the relevance to a theory of myth of Saussure, Gadamer, and Lacan, on the one hand, and Levi-Strauss and Barthes on the other.

  Author(s) Tucker Amanda<br>
  Abstract: In his seminal essay ‘Imaginary Homelands’, Salman Rushdie describes how, at a conference on modern writing, novelists struggled to articulate the purpose of their artform. After these (unnamed) fiction writers outlined the need for ‘new ways of describing the world’, another participant suggested that this objective might be limited. Rushdie argues that description is in fact political and, moreover, that ‘redescribing the world is the necessary first step in changing it’ (Rushdie, 1991: 13). He is particularly interested in how fictional representations might lead to systemic change and sets creative perspectives against official, government-sanctioned points of view: ‘at times when<br>

  Abstract: There’s no getting around it. The route connecting Maître François’s illuminated rendering of the flight from Sodom to Blanchot’s and Levinas’s guarded turns to the Sodom archive has no historical warranty. Blanchot and Levinas’s mutual interest in the question of art charted a wide-ranging interrogation of the enigmatic fact of the artwork’s existence and the unquiet character of art’s aesthetic and ethical open-endedness, conducted across several genres and historical environments.² Their expedition, however, did not pause at the late-medieval scene of manuscript illumination.<br>

  Abstract: Making a connection between romanticism and technology is not a very obvious thing to do; the two terms do not seem to live together comfortably. The main reason for this has to do with the fact that we are romantics to the bone: most romantics think that there is an unbridgeable gap between both.

  Abstract: Persistence or continuity in history is an underrated and often overlooked factor. It lacks the high drama of mutability, and it is at variance with the everyday awareness of diurnal changes – from day to night, and on to day again. In the phraseology of Henri Bergson, the fertile French philosopher—psychologist who probed the human sense of temporal flux: ‘Being is always Becoming’ and ‘Becoming is infinitely varied.’¹ Yet to be able to measure change, whether at macro-or micro-level, there must be some constant factors to act as benchmarks.<br>

  Abstract: Post-war reconstruction in Europe presented formidable, in fact unprecedented, tasks. They were, above all, material. But the challenges were also moral and symbolic. While the Holocaust was to remain marginal to thinking about the war at least until the 1960s, the meaning of mass violence and atrocity was immediately debated by political thinkers across the continent. After all, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s more people had been ‘killed by their fellow human beings than ever before in the history of humankind’.¹<br>

  Abstract: The twentieth century demonstrated that Europe was no longer central to world politics. It had done so brutally in the First and Second World Wars; in a less obvious – and, of course, less brutal – way the 1960s were also to drive home this point. The decade seemed to synchronize political and cultural dissatisfaction around the globe – what the CIA at the time referred to as a ‘world-wide phenomenon of restless youth’ (another American institution,
                  Timemagazine, would actually declare youth the ‘Man of the Year’ in 1967). Outside Western Europe, the political stakes were clearly very high:<br>

  Abstract: The theory of fiction is perhaps the most difficult aspect of the philosophy of literature, as well as the one that has attracted the most sustained scholarly attention. For some curious reason, commentary on the subject has produced not only some penetrating insights but also more than its fair share of embarrassing banalities. Gregory Currie, for example, informs us that ‘we say that an inference is reasonable when it has a relatively high degree of reasonableness, unreasonable when its degree of reasonableness is very low’.¹ Peter Lamarque impresses on us the fact that ‘fictional characters, like Mr. Allworthy or Miss<br>

  4  Walden from:

Emerson spoke of him, at the funeral service, as if he were a phenomenon, a fact of nature rather than of human life. He remarked that his admirers called him “that terrible Thoreau,” “as if he spoke when silent, and was still present when he had departed.” One of his friends said, according to<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS BOOK SO FAR, I have been looking at factors that make academic intellectual culture opaque or alienating to many students: seemingly counterintuitive problems and argumentative practices that are rarely explained; curricular mixed messages that further muddy those practices; phobias about adversarial debate and intellectual analysis; obfuscating habits of academic writing; the tendency to withhold the critical conversations that students are expected to enter. In this chapter, I shift the emphasis by examining some ways in which academic and student cultures are closer to each other than they seem and how teachers can take advantage of this convergence.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Ways In and Out of the Hermeneutic Circle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npkg4">Theory of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Despite the intimidating sound of the word, “hermeneutics” is easily defined as the science of interpretation. You would think hermeneutics had always been a matter of interest, but in fact it’s of continuous interest only fairly recently. Aristotle did write a treatise called
                     De Interpretatione, and the Middle Ages were much concerned with interpretation, so I suppose what I’m saying in part is that the word “hermeneutics” wasn’t then available; but it’s also true that at many times the idea that there ought to be a systematic study of how we interpret things wasn’t a matter of pressing concern.<br>

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

In the past few chapters the emphasis has been on explicating the exegetical techniques, which offered the strong exegetes the possibility of discovering, in fact rediscovering, religious worlds that had previously been adopted by the Kabbalists, or sometimes by their philosophical sources, from a variety of relatively late intellectual and literary corpora—mostly Greek thought as translated and adapted in Arabic and, less frequently, Latin. We should be aware, however, that<br>

  II  The Good: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn3q">The Good, the True, and the Beautiful</a><br>
  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  Abstract: Since my first lectures at the Collège de France more than thirty years ago, my aim has been clear: to take up the challenge of molecular biology and apply its paradigms and methods to a study of the brain and its most highly integrated functions, such as consciousness and thought. So where do we stand all these years later? Let us try to establish some new facts and some research perspectives for the decades to come.<br>

  Foreword from:

  Author(s) Wilson George M.<br>
  Abstract: I suppose that Noël Carroll is best known within film studies as the unremitting arch nemesis of Big Theory, and certainly his 1988 book
                  Mystifying Moviesis a devastating systematic attack on the sweeping pretensions of the film theory that dominated the 1970s and 1980s. Potentially enhancing his grim reputation is the fact that Carroll introduced the philosophy of horror as a systematic topic in contemporary aesthetics. Anyone who knows Carroll personally, however, will have trouble sustaining an image of him derived from Dr. Mabuse or the Creeper or some other monster of mayhem and subversion. Carroll is a funny,<br>

  Abstract: This volume is a collection of my essays, written in the second half of the 1990s, on the topic of the

  Abstract: As with other artforms, the initial problem of talking about style or form in film is complicated by the fact that the concept of style can be applied to so many different kinds of things and at so many different levels of generality.¹ One might use “style” to refer to whole periods of filmmaking, speaking, for example, of the German Expressionist style, or Hollywood studio style in the thirties. Or one might apply the concept of style to the work of a particular filmmaker’s oeuvre, referring, for instance, to the style of Stanley Donen or Yvonne Rainer or Theo Angelopoulos.<br>

  Abstract: Whenever some tragedy or natural disaster takes place these days, one can be sure to find a group of men and women holding homemade placards inscribed with the pregnant word “Why?” These people are not looking for factual explanations. They know very well that the earthquake was the result of a fissure deep in the earth, or that the murder was the work of a serial killer released too soon from custody. “Why?” does not mean, “What was the cause of this?” It is more of a lament than a query.

  Abstract: Certainty can be exhilarating; uncertainty, never. There is something fundamentally disquieting about not knowing the truth of things, the real as opposed to the unreal, the facts as opposed to the theories. Admittedly, artists and intellectuals occasionally celebrate uncertainty as if it were a liberating cause, but in the end uncertainty holds no thrill for me. Pliny’s maxim that ‘‘There is nothing certain but uncertainty, and nothing more miserable and arrogant than man’’ possesses the very quality the statement means to disparage.

                     Stalker, a minimalist science fiction epic set in a dreary, bombed-out industrial wasteland. The title does not derive from the contemporary connotation of the sexual predator, but goes back to the sort of guide who leads hunters to where game can be found. In fact, the script deliberately associates its stalker with the James Fenimore Cooper character Natty Bumppo, who is known as “Deerstalker.”<br>

  Abstract: By all accounts, Saint Irenaeus of Lyons, a bishop of the early church, didn’t have it easy. For one thing, he’d left the thriving, well-established Christian community in Asia Minor for what was, in essence, missionary territory. Lyons was hardly the back of the beyond—it was, in fact, a thriving commercial center in southern Gaul that did a lot of trade with the East, which was why Christianity could slip in so easily. But if the bourgeois cosmopolitanism of the city offered opportunities for the fledgling church, it also posed its own set of challenges.<br>

  Abstract: Prodromal and pre-psychotic states are characterized by pervasive instabilities on all levels of experience and could lead to what Karl Jaspers calls limit-situations (

In the process of defending against such existential instabilities or limit-situations, different strategies and mechanisms are employed to provide a shelter or enclosure (Gehäuse). In this article, we explore the transition from the limitsituations to enclosures in psychotic and mystical states. In both we can differentiate multiple orientations. Many individuals, who experience psychotic and mystical states, have in fact experiences of both, at least to some extent. Together with everyday, common-sense level of experience we can<br>

The following three chapters will examine how mega-novels’ incorporation of elements from other literary genres produces more extensive but equally pointless cruft, inducing the same characteristic frustration and boredom to provoke a similar reorientation of attention.

That they were so quickly successful bears witness to the failure of the PLO’s political socialization tools within the camp. Several factors explain this dynamic. First, Salafism offered a new intellectual horizon to its partisans, allowing those who had not personally experienced the Palestinian nationalist struggle to look beyond their geographical, legal, and political restrictions as “Palestinian refugees” in Lebanon. Salafism offered a new religious identity and new possibilities for action severed from a Palestinian cause that<br>

  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

  Author(s) BRANDON LAURA<br>
  Abstract: More than 60,000 Canadians died during the First World War (1914–18), ten per cent of those who enlisted. More than 150,000 were injured. Over one million Canadians served between 1939 and 1945; 45,000 of them died, and 55,000 suffered injuries in a conflict marked by unprecedented violence on both sides. While a significant number of Canadian artworks from these wars depict the destruction meted out on the built, manufactured, and natural environments, the subject of physical violence is rare. Nonetheless, whether the soldiers, airmen, or sailors were from the allied or combatant sides of the conflicts, a survey of<br>

  Abstract: It is a remarkable fact that some forty years later, the year 1968 remains an obligatory point of reference for contemporary politics. During the 2008 presidential election, one of Barack Obama’s campaign pledges was that he would elevate American politics to a plateau of unity beyond the divisiveness of the 1960s. The John McCain campaign, for its part, tried repeatedly to tarnish Obama’s luster by dramatizing his association during the early days of his political career with former 1960s radical William Ayers.

A young working-class girl, Brigitte Dewevre, had been sadistically murdered, her mutilated, unclothed corpse left in a vacant field. The crime scene bespoke a level of brutality to which France was entirely unaccustomed.

  Abstract: In our day, we tend to shrug off discussion of metaphysics, as if no knowledge were to be gained from learning what it means

We are concerned with facts; facts are real; but, as to what makes a fact a fact, we think the matter beyond discussion and perhaps even beneath contempt.<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: Examining the writings of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and the Neoplatonists, Struck demonstrates that they all observed how, setting aside the charlatans and swindlers, some people had premonitions defying the typical bounds of rationality. Given the wide differences among these ancient thinkers, Struck notes that they converged on seeing this surplus insight as an artifact of human nature, projections produced under specific conditions by our physiology. For the philosophers, such unexplained insights invited a speculative search for an alternative and more naturalistic system of cognition.<br>

  Abstract: In Europe the impact of population aging has become a popular threat to the health care systems. Recently, 2,700 European “opinion leaders” working in the health field were asked to identify the most significant problem contributing to the growth of health care expenditure. The survey reported population aging to be the number one issue.¹ Much of the popularity of this response may be related to the fact that it is hard to blame someone in the health field for this problem.² But in contrast to this broad agreement on the significance of the population aging issue in the health field,<br>

  Abstract: In the last two decades human genetics has developed into an extensive scientific field of enormous range, a dynamism that previously didn’t exist. New molecular genetic techniques have enabled far-reaching changes to take place in medicine, with new knowledge and new techniques in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. New models of health and disease are superseding old ones. Scientists predict that these developments will lead to a deeper understanding of disease and health. The individual propensities of each person for mono-and multifactorial diseases and disorders can be recognized and foreseen.<br>

  Abstract: The future is unpredictable. But one thing we can do is examine the factors that are likely to steer the development of specific institutions: in this case, medicine. That is what I will do in this essay. To identify those factors, however, it is first necessary to define the situation in which medicine currently finds itself and examine the events that forged that situation. I suggest that the current state of medicine is shaped by three circumstances.<br>

Philo’s views of women have regularly been seen as uniformly negative. The only open question has pertained to the origin of his views, whether they derived from Jewish or Greek sources.¹ In this context an important factor has regularly been overlooked, namely, Philo’s dramatic intellectual development as a result of his visit<br>

  Abstract: The ideology of scientific motherhood began to gain ground in Canada in the late nineteenth century, and came to rationalize mothering for Mennonite women along expert and scientific lines. Scientific motherhood was a widespread cultural movement that sought to reproduce the conditions of industrialization and regulate the modes of women’s labour inside the “factory” home. Scientific motherhood is closely associated with urbanization, industrialization, the medicalization of childbirth, and the increasing popularity of artificial formula that characterized its rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (see Apple), a time of significant Mennonite resettlement in Canada.

  Abstract: Sensitive language, remembrance photography, and mementos have become integrated into stillbirth care practices in North American health care institutions for parents and families who have experienced the death of an infant. While representations reflect how families, caregivers, and society understand stillbirth, they also help shape our relationship with birth, death, and both as they occur together. From both subjective and objective points of view, this chapter will explore how words, images, and artifacts come to represent multiple meanings of stillbirth in a way that can both challenge and contribute to the silence, stigma, and emancipation of bereaved parents from ambiguity<br>

This results in a struggle for the right to express critique and then a legitimation battle. Beginning with Tom McCarthy’s oblique engagement with the academy through his public intellectualism and canny understanding of generic conventions, I suggested that C, although not a work that directly depicts academia, is a novel tightly bound to formalist criticism and canon formation and a<br>

  Abstract: The crises at the end of the Ming and Qing dynasties, crises caused by dynastic weakness and the threat of foreign domination, had obvious effects on the writing of vernacular fiction, drawing in new authors and giving rise to new themes and new techniques.¹ Of the two crises, the late Qing was the more complex, with economic and cultural challenges superimposed on the military and political threats. Moreover, two additional factors were at work in this period: the new media of newspapers and journals, and foreign fiction, available in translation for the first time.<br>

  Women’s Poetic Witnessing: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tg5hxm">Dynastic Crisis and Cultural Innovation</a><br>
  Author(s) Chang Kang-i Sun<br>
  Abstract: In traditional Chinese poetry, the task of witnessing-especially on the subject of war and other political issues-was generally assumed to be male territory. But, in fact, the earliest important work of political witnessing in Chinese poetry was attributed to a woman. In a poem written at the end of the Han dynasty (late second century BeE) and entitled “Beifen shi” 悲憤詩 (Poem of lament and indignation), Cai Yan 蔡琰 narrated her unfortunate experiences during the upheavals of the Dong Zhuo rebellion, including her capture by “barbarian” Xiongnu and her many subsequent dilemmas, experiences over which she had little or no<br>

  TWO  Wen and the Meaning of Verbal Art from:

  Abstract: The term
                  wen, which has a pre-eminent place both in Confucian philosophy and among the virtues named in theZuozhuanandGuoyu, is notorious for the complexity of its semantic range. In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, it functions largely as an epithet for deceased ancestors and rulers and appears to mean something like “accomplished.”¹ In references to artifacts, it denotes stripes of the sort found on cowry shells or patterns woven into cloth.² It is the preferred pre-Qin word for “logograph.”³ In the writings of certain philosophers, most notably Xunzi, it becomes a more abstract sort of “pattern,” the<br>

  FIVE  The Anecdotal History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tg5npx">A Patterned Past</a><br>
  Abstract: Historical knowledge can take many forms, but historical understanding always requires narration.¹ A text such as the
                  Chunqiu, with its dates and facts, does not so much convey understanding as assume it. TheZuozhuanand theGuoyu, in contrast, explain known or alleged facts of the Spring and Autumn period by recording them in the context of narratives. Although premodern critics of theZuozhuanas a commentary on theChunqiusometimes ranked it behind theGongyangandGuliangcommentaries, with their more direct articulations of the sage’s judgments, there have always been readers who recognized that without the narratives of<br>

  Abstract: The irreducible fact about Jesus is that he was executed. Yet he did not represent an armed threat to the existing order. He broke no civil or criminal laws. He violated religious laws and customs regarding the Sabbath, hand-washing, and holiness, but in every case the issue hung on interpretation, and no doubt some rabbis would have supported him; at least they would not have condemned him to death. He mainly taught, healed, and exorcised. Why then was he such a threat that he had to be killed?<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur explains in

The decisions made by archivists on what should and should not be included in a collection are the first step in the process of interpreting historical facts; all the succeeding choices the historian makes depend on the composition and structure of the archive. As a consequence, the archive is not only the ‘starting point’ of historical research, it is also part of the historiographical discourse.¹ Furthermore, the act of collecting documents and objects always implies a change in<br>

  Abstract: Museums and archives share an inherent objective: to keep memories alive for the future by preserving objects from the past (Pearce, 1995: 249). To realise this goal, they endeavour to prevent the decay – or further decay – of their artefacts by, first, treating these objects with extreme caution and trying, as much as possible, to limit the destructive impact of environmental factors (Pomian, 1988: 14); and, second, cleaning and restoring them, repairing the damage that inevitably accrues over time. Both of these activities can be categorised as part of the ‘preservation process’.<br>

  Abstract: I wish in this short paper to touch on three aspects of literary change: (1) the nature of change; (2) the kinds of change; (3) explanations of change. I do not wish to debate the meanings of the term “literary,” and I shall, therefore, assume that what is “literary” is what authors, critics, theorists have identified at the same time or at different times as “literary.” The fact that such authorities may disagree about the significance of “literary” will in no way affect the inquiry I propose. My aim is to offer a propaedeutic for a study of literary change.<br>

  Abstract: This first chapter focuses on political conceptualisations of popular culture in France, by which I mean conceptualisations developed by governments, parties, national institutions and the kind of public intellectuals who, as Ahearne (2010: 2) puts it, ‘have moved in and out of positions within public policy processes’. Other chapters in this volume will be concerned with popular-cultural artefacts themselves. My focus here is on how such artefacts have been institutionally represented over time. For if, as Kuisel claims, France itself is an invention, a conceptualisation, this is in part due to the way its popular culture has represented it and<br>

  Abstract: Giovanni’s Roombegins with its protagonist, a young, white American named David, staring out the window of a house in the south of France. There, brooding on the events that he is about to recount, David emphasizes that they “were acted out under a foreign sky.” He suggests that this fact undergirds all others in the narrative, that if you didn’t know he was an American abroad, you wouldn’t be able to understand the nature of what has transpired. To understand David, and David’s story, you must understand that he is an American who has traveled outside of America. “There<br>

  Author(s) Miller Geordie<br>
  Abstract: Modern forms of philanthropy have close ties to cosmopolitanism. Both putatively reject the hierarchies of race, class, gender, language, religion, and nation in favour of a more fundamental understanding of human equality. Yet, as with cosmopolitanism, critics have linked philanthropy to the expansion of capital and the spread of exploitation. The correlation between capitalist and philanthropic expansion is clearest in the age of Empire. In fact, the

  Abstract: Persuasion is a special aspect of our social and linguistic practices – one where an interlocutor, or an audience, is induced, to perform a certain action or to endorse a certain belief, and these episodes are not due to the force of the better reason. When we come near persuasion, it seems that, in general, we are somehow giving up factual discourse (and perhaps the principles of logic), since persuading must be understood as almost different from convincing rationally¹.

  Book Title: History-Narration, Interpretation, Orientation<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: Without denying the importance of the postmodernist approach to the narrative form and rhetorical strategies of historiography, the author, one of Germany's most prominent cultural historians, argues here in favor of reason and methodical rationality in history. He presents a broad variety of aspects, factors and developments of historical thinking from the 18th century to the present, thus continuing, in exemplary fashion, the tradition of critical self-reflection in the humanities and looking at historical studies as an important factor of cultural orientation in practical life.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fc2">History</a><br>
  Abstract: History is much more than only a matter of historical studies. It is an essential cultural factor in everybody’s life, since human life needs an orientation in the course of time which has to be brought about by remembering the past. Historical studies are a systematic way of performing this function of orientation. In order to understand what historians do one should start with this fundamental and general function.<br>

  Author(s) Altvater Elmar<br>
  Abstract: It is evident that, among other factors, the functioning of the welfare state as well as the institutional richness and democratic reach of the civil society depends heavily on the economic efficiency of a given society. Now, the question is: what does economic efficiency depend on? There are several different answers, each of them depending on their theoretical background. Neoliberals or neo-classical economists stress the meaning of the “invisible hand” of a free-market system as the crucial prerequisite for achieving the best distribution of productive factors, of finding the best path of innovation and evolution, and for realizing the highest<br>

  Author(s) Glotz Peter<br>
  Abstract: The political world has been changing radically since the Central European revolution of 1989. Instead of traditional bi-polar conflict, we now have the potential for multi-polar political conflict. Small wars have once again become a real possibility. Ethnic and social conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe are brewing into equally revolutionary and explosive mixtures. Despite these changes, however, Western Europe’s political classes are still sitting impassively at yesterday’s gambling tables, placing their bets as though oblivious of the fact that “Rouge” and “Noir” have become almost indistinguishable after the historic downpour. They mutter strange codes under their breath (CSCE, CFE,<br>

  Abstract: Other than the time between the two World Wars, democracy has been a remarkable success after World War II. From 1918 through 1939, after the progression of democratic tendencies in the beginning of the 1920s, most countries in Europe gradually returned to autocratic, even fascist regimes. Today it is a fact that democracy is deeply rooted in Western European countries and all communist regimes in the eastern half of Europe have failed. Some countries, in that region, though, are on their way to democracy, and in other countries democratic governments are trying their first steps, which turn out to be<br>

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

The European “dark ages” is the exemplary case, though its darkness is now widely contested and redistributed among a number of different cultures. The mid-third millennium BC in the Middle East, the founding centuries of Rome, and “Dynasty 0” in Egypt are also examples of periods whose sequences may always be inadequately known. Elsewhere and further back in history the gaps grow wider, and the known objects fewer and farther between.

  Abstract: The genres of autobiographical writing and utopian writing have little in common. While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

Such is the very general question with which I would like to begin. As Husserl recalls at the very beginning of his lectures on the phenomenology of internal time-consciousness, the question of time and its contingency has always constituted the most crucial challenge for philosophy, marking the limits of its enterprise to intellectually possess the world because, as the very stuff of things, time seems to escape radically from<br>

  Abstract: Following the definition established by Aristotle, ethics examines the relationship between our capacity to mark and repeat certain actions, which includes recognizing rules and giving them to oneself, and the passivity denoted in the fact that experiences and ideas impress themselves on us. The good life consists in managing this activity and passivity on the complex field of economic, social and political life. The primary occasion in which we feel this challenge is the encounter with someone in need, where a face alone is often enough to call forth a response visibly guided by prior education and experience.

The first is of a deconstructive nature, while the second is constitutive. In order to identify them separately—and before turning to the antonymic point at which they converge—we need to return to two authors who were both very much present in Arendt’s formative years.

However—and this is the analytical shift that moves in a direction unexplored by Alain—the fact that force deploys in an originary void is not the same as saying that it is the origin of the universe. If things were so, that is, if origin were once again self-coincidental on the side of force, then its plenitude alone would exist rather than the emptiness throughout which it extends.

  Book Title: Piaget's Theory of Knowledge-Genetic Epistemology and Scientific Reason<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KITCHENER RICHARD F.<br>
  Abstract: Best known as a child psychologist, Jean Piaget considered himself primarily an epistemologist who was engaged in empirical research on the development of knowledge. In this book, philosopher and psychologist Richard F. Kitchener provides the first comprehensive study in English of Piaget's genetic epistemology, or his theory of knowledge. Drawing largely on a careful perusal of Piaget's untranslated works, Kitchener presents little-known aspects of Piaget's thought and argues that, in fact, Piagest has been misunderstood and was completely justified in his claim to be an epistemologist rather than a psychologist.<br>

Opinions would probably differ here, with serious consideration begin given to B. F. Skinner and Ivan Pavlov. But Jean Piaget would also most assuredly be mentioned. By universal consensus Piaget is counted as one of the two or three most significant figures in twentieth-century psychology. In fact, he is generally taken to be the most significant child or developmental psychologist in the history of psychology. He has studied scores of children busily<br>

How is it possible, for example, for the necessary truths contained in logic and mathematics to result from the contingent ones the child first encounters?¹ How is it possible for the epistemic objectivity of adulthood to develop from the subjectivity and egocentrism of childhood? How is it possible for objective social structures, containing properties ofjustice, fairness, and reciprocity, to develop from individual behavior patterns lacking these features? How is it possible for scientific knowledge to have developed from earlier modes<br>

  Abstract: In a lecture presented at the Library of Congress in 1948, T. S. Eliot acknowledges so early an acquaintance with Poe that he cannot be sure whether his own work has been influenced by him. He then distances himself from his predecessor by focusing on Poe’s relation to the French Symbolists Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Valéry.¹ This detour through another country and another language is the standard reading of the Eliot-Poe connection: Poe’s insistence on the poem as a formal artifact, as well as his critical self-consciousness, influenced the French Symbolists, who in turn influenced Eliot. Clearly, Eliot shares the Symbolists’<br>

The seemingly contradictory commentary that her work sustains proves her success in “con-fusing” romantic and modernist oppositions: she has been read as an autobiographical poet with an impersonal touch, as a surrealist given to meticulous observations of natural facts, and as a formalist whose poems are open-ended accumulations of detail.¹ Her distinction is to have developed the kind of diction and formal flexibility that enable her to be at home on<br>

Untethered words wander around aimlessly, whence we get our concept of ambiguity or the waywardness of discourse. However, the tying down of one’s words is not easy. In fact, sometimes Socrates makes it sound like the question is all that can be justifiably put into words.

  Abstract: Even earlier in the twentieth century, the public agenda seemed lost or abandoned. In an atmosphere of crisis, civic institutions could only repeat empty symbolic reassurances. The symbols were in fact empty, because there appeared to be no learned experience except failure for them to rest on. Resignation, cynicism, and hopelessness had become the order of the day. In the midst of this material and symbolic dispossession it seems almost fanciful to imagine a creative ethical option for speech.

  Abstract: Even earlier in the twentieth century, the public agenda seemed lost or abandoned. In an atmosphere of crisis, civic institutions could only repeat empty symbolic reassurances. The symbols were in fact empty, because there appeared to be no learned experience except failure for them to rest on. Resignation, cynicism, and hopelessness had become the order of the day. In the midst of this material and symbolic dispossession it seems almost fanciful to imagine a creative ethical option for speech. Around the world oratory flourished; but it was hardly the sort to revive hopes for participatory democracy. Imagine now a public<br>

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remained in the USA.<br>

  Book Title: Points of Departure-Rethinking Student Source Use and Writing Studies Research Methods<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xzh15w">Points of Departure</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the great challenges and opportunities of educational research is rectifying predictions about how learning theoretically works with how learning
                  actuallyworks in—and across—different contexts. Those of us who study writing and literacy are uniquely aware of these tensions. In fact, writing studies research traditionally inquires into how beautifully divergent and surprising learning can be in practice. Conversations about writing processes in 1960s writing-pedagogy research embody this tension; theoretical understandings oftypicalprocesses of developing writers became dangerously calcified intothewriting process quite quickly. What began as inquiry about how writing happens (Cooper 1986; Emig 1971;<br>

  Abstract: This piece, a requested summary of

This sequence is well known to believers: after a time of peaceful possession of the faith, they become aware of challenges to it. If not doubt, at least an ongoing questioning—what St. Thomas called thecogitatio—is a part of the faith. It is the passport into what Paul Ricoeur calls the second naiveté,¹ which is more or less the state of a<br>

We shall not encounter a single binding concept of reality in Dostoevsky’s thought; rather, his notion of reality is a syncretism.³ Reality for him embraces concrete, historical reality with its classes, its immediate problems and conflicts, and its social and national types which give expression to the<br>

In his biography Lotman “wanted to show how, like the mythological King Midas who turned everything he touched to gold, Pushkin turned everything he touched into creativity, art. [But] Midas starved to death — his food became gold.”² This metaphor is strikingly apropos when it comes to the facts of Pushkin’s life.

  2.4  Toward Interpretation Semiotics from:

  Author(s) Petrilli Susan<br>
  Abstract: The mid 1970s onward have been decisive years in Italian semiotics considering both the development in general sign theory as well as the flourishing of the various specific semiotics. In fact, these years mark a transition from decodification semiotics, which was influenced either directly or indirectly by Saussurean linguistics, to interpretation semiotics, largely a derivation of the Peircean-Morrisian tradition. Two books by Umberto Eco–A
                  Theory of Semioticsof 1975 andSemiotics and the Philosophy of Languageof 1984–may be viewed as expressions of this transition. Indeed, Eco’sA Theory of Semioticsmay be taken as the point of<br>

But what is a surprising fact, to use Peirce’s notable term for that which comes to us from experience and shakes us out of old habit into new play, is Eco’s occasional mention of the dramatic text as representing through the work of so me twentieth-century playwrights a prototype of the indeterminacy,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005sns">Signs and Society</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the puzzles of the intellectual history of the “pragmatic” turn in contemporary linguistics is the fact that the American mathematician and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914), who developed a graphic formalism for evaluating the logical precision of scientific concepts, continues to be an important inspiration for the development of approaches to language that move beyond the synchronic, descriptive, and generative perspectives characteristic of the mainstream of linguistics scholarship. Many students of language first encountered Peirce’s semiotic ideas in the early 1920s in the ten pages of excerpts printed as an appendix to Ogden and Richards’s

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005szf">A Theory of Musical Narrative</a><br>
  Abstract: Musical narrative resists simple formulation, its complex identity emerging through a confluence of factors. First, the essential characteristics of narrative are partly obscured by the distinct inflections given it by the different media through which it manifests itself. Dramatic narrative is phenomenally immediate, realized by characters and settings both visually and audibly present. Literary narrative is likewise relatively specific with respect to character and setting, but is constructed through verbal description and dialogue. Mythic narrative invokes characters, settings, and/or themes with numinous cultural significance, situating these elements in an idealized, hyper-real manner. Historical narrative ostensibly employs real events and characters<br>

  Author(s) Craig Megan<br>
  Abstract: Each of us has a place we presently occupy, a place from whence we came, and an ambiguous place toward which we are heading. Even if the present place is makeshift or temporary, if one is a refugee or homeless, being in the world entails occupying, however minimally, some shred of ground. Heidegger underscored this fact of existence by the term
                  Dasein: “being-there.” One is always emplaced one way or another in the wider world. Levinas responded to Heidegger by noting that wherever one finds oneself, the “there” of “being-there” entails the usurpation of someone else’s place.¹ Quoting Pascal at<br>

  Abstract: To consider seriously cosmopolitan ideals (in Part I of this volume) is to engage universalism of one or more sorts—moral, political, economic, religious, and cultural. It is to take up notions of universal and equal intrinsic worth, the dignity of all persons, and border-blind, history-blind, color-blind, money-blind, gender-blind (and so on) rights and responsibilities. And it is to entertain worldviews in which tribal, local, regional, national, and other differences are mere artifacts of time, inessential contingencies, instances of good luck or bad fortune, and facts that cannot serve as bases for reason-based values and actions.<br>

Not only information but socialization and political life exist online; for many people, in fact, those relationships and conversations accessed via electronic mediums constitute the majority of all such interactions. And despite the hand-wringing that this fact might inspire in those nostalgic for pre-internet days, these interactions are

  14  The Good News about Alterity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: Derrida’s work is often mistakenly criticized as a kind of linguistic subjective idealism which traps us inside a chain of linguistic signifiers, unable to do anything but play vainly with linguistic strings. In fact, Derrida’s thought is through and through a philosophy of “alterity,” of openness to the other, which provides a rich and vigorous catalyst for religious thought. After demonstrating the wrongheadedness of the subjectivist reading of Derrida, I go on to show the richness of this philosophy of alterity for theology: first, in terms of the negative theology, where alterity refers to God as the absolutely Other; and<br>

  Abstract: This essay is an attempt to grapple with an experience I had upon entering the academic profession about a decade ago and teaching a large undergraduate lecture class at a state university for the first time in my career. I often felt that my speech during my lectures sounded hollow, that it lacked resonance with my audience (composed in part of students with a strong sense of white male entitlement, compounded with commitment to stereotypical gender norms, ageism, and expectations of a familiar “native” accent), despite the fact that I enunciated well and occupied an official position of authority in<br>

  Abstract: Two of the most slippery yet well-established divisions that have traditionally distinguished human beings from one another are age and disability, respectively. With respect to the former, even a cursory examination of different cultures and different historical time periods reveals how widely societies vary in their identifications of youth, middle age, and old age, much less in the roles and responsibilities that are deemed appropriate for each period of life. This cultural and historical variability is clearly due to many complex factors, chief among them being the average life expectancy for a particular group of people and the specific habitus<br>

  Book Title: Self-Understanding and Lifeworld-Basic Traits of a Phenomenological Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): RAYMAN JOSHUA<br>
  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

She was the spirit of a particular Goose, one who hailed from the jurisdiction of Winchester. In fact, she identified as a Winchester Goose, argot for a medieval prostitute. She and her fellow Winchester Geese had been sex workers in what were called “stews” (or “stewes”) or brothels—or, in later colloquial accounts, “nunneries”¹—on London’s South Bank, in what is now the Borough of Southwark, a mere five hundred<br>

  Abstract: THE CONCERN WITH the power of judgment arises in Hannah Arendt’s work in response to critical events in modernity. As a result of the impotence of familiar standards and categories to provide answers and orientation, this power has become undone. It is a question not only of the impotence of the common standards regarding certain events of modernity but also of the fact that these events have been so terrifying that they have altogether destroyed all our habitual categories of thought and standards of judgment.

  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: The links between colonization and the Republic remain of utmost importance and relevance to contemporary debates in French society. Might colonization, in fact, represent the inevitable reverse side of what stands as a universal utopia, one that invariably becomes less and less “pure” as one moves away from the center (the metropole), and as the color of the people who are theoretically placed under its “protection” becomes darker?

  Abstract: The links between colonization and the Republic remain of utmost importance and relevance to contemporary debates in French society. Might colonization, in fact, represent the inevitable reverse side of what stands as a universal utopia, one that invariably becomes less and less “pure” as one moves away from the center (the metropole), and as the color of the people who are theoretically placed under its “protection” becomes darker?

In his weekly “Views and Reviews” column for the Pittsburgh

  Book Title: Novelas españolas ambientadas en Italia-Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar; Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez<br>
  Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca<br>
  Author(s): SANTOS M.ª ALMUDENA MATEOS<br>
  Abstract: Las fuentes en las que se fundamenta la novela histórica proporcionan, además de una ambientación correcta de la acción, la veracidad necesaria para que el lector reconozca el trabajo llevado a cabo por el autor. Este estudio se centra en descubrir las fuentes históricas, literarias, artísticas, religiosas y culturales de dos novelas muy diferentes que comparten un marco común, el Renacimiento Italiano. Mientras que en Fra Filippo Lippi de Emilio Castelar (1877-1879) la exactitud histórica se presenta sólo en determinados capítulos que parecen ralentizar la acción, en Bomarzo de Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), lo histórico está tan integrado que es difícil detectar qué parte se corresponde con la historia y cuál con la ficción. Las fuentes consultadas por los autores e incorporadas al texto narrativo proporcionan laexhaustividad necesaria para que el ambiente histórico recreado sea preciso. Al confrontar dichas fuentes con el texto literario se observa cómo, además, el marco creado ayuda a delimitarla psicología de los protagonistas, pues, aunque son personajes históricos, los autores crean una vida de ficción a partir de los hechos históricos. Por otro lado, las referencias literarias (correspondientes a un periodo que va desde los siglos XV y XVI hasta el presente de los autores) aportan el marco necesario para que los protagonistas sean portadores de una nueva inmortalidad. La exactitud de las descripciones, la configuración de los caracteres tanto renacentistas como contemporáneos, las perspectivas artísticas o religiosas, configuran estas dos obras en una serie de coincidencias difíciles de obviar.The sources, which the historical novel is based on, provide the correct setting of the action and the necessary truthfulness for the reader to recognise the work carried out by the author. This research focuses on discovering the historical, literary, artistic, religious and cultural sources of two very different novels that share common framework of the Italian Renaissance. In Fra Filippo Lippi by Emilio Catelar (1877-1879) the historical accuracy is presented only incertain chapters, and slow down the action, whereas in Bomarzo by Manuel Mujica Lainez (1962), historical facts are integrated in such a way that it is difficult to detect which parts belong to fiction or non-fiction. The sources consulted by the authors and which are incorporated into the narrative text provide the necessary detail for the recreated historical environment to be accurate. Additionally, when comparing these historical sources with the literary text, it is obvious how the historical facts help to demonstrate the psychology of the main characters because, although they are historical characters, the authors create a living fiction based on historical events. The literary references, belonging to a period that covers the fifteenth and sixteenth century to the present of authors contribute the necessary details so that the main characters are bearers o fa new immortality. The accuracy of descriptions, the representation of both Renaissance and Contemporary characters and artistic and religious perspectives present us with a series of coincidences too obvious to ignore.<br>

  Abstract: A generation after the issuance of Humanae Vitae, dissatisfaction with the conclusions and method of the tradition has not abated among many theologians. The focus of the debate has become fairly well defined; for the most part, theologians have concentrated their efforts on justifying a rejection of the traditional claim that some kinds of actions, apart from specifying circumstances, are intrinsically wrong, that some kinds of actions should never be freely chosen by human agents no matter what good is intended or foreseen.¹ They prefer instead to speak of “premoral,” “ontic,” or “physical” evils that cannot be morally defined apart<br>

  Abstract: Cultural historians necessarily deal in broad generalizations. Whatever is affirmed of a period, a people, or a nation, no matter how well-grounded by factual study and reflection, is subject to qualification. Exceptions to broad characterizations may always be found without mitigating the value of the broader insight. We grasp something when an author refers to the Greeks, to Roman civilization, to the Hellenic period, to Christendom, to the Benedictines, to the Renaissance, or to the Enlightenment. These designations, all generalizations formed by an examination of a host of particulars, indeed refer to something intelligible, something quite apart from the mind.¹<br>

  Abstract: As is well known, Gregory of Nazianzus (ca. 329–390) arrived in Constantinople in September 379 to commence a theological preaching and teaching mission. His mission had as its aim the advancement of Nicene orthodoxy in the city and the establishment of a viable unity among the members of the then current theological factions, who strongly disagreed about various aspects of the way in which the Trinity should be defined and understood. What is not so well known is that Gregory, as part of his rhetorical strategy, made use of polemical references to Montanus (d. ca. 175) and Montanists.¹ Gregory<br>

  Abstract: To enter into the question of man’s existence is to immerse oneself in the mystery of the absolute itself. Every step of Bruaire’s systematic anthropology reveals the impossibility of giving a satisfactory account of who man is if one’s understanding of the absolute is inadequate.¹ Although from his very first works Bruaire contends that only a determinate absolute is able to make reason out of man’s existence, his explication of what it means for God to be both “absolute” and “determinate” undergoes a remarkable evolution. Up until the publication of For Metaphysics in 1980, Bruaire’s concept of God as determinate<br>

  Abstract: The ontological examination of being as gift undertaken so far appears to be too anthropologically burdened to allow for a concept of absolute gift. In fact, if being-gift is being-given and being-in-debt, then it does not seem possible to formulate a concept of gift which, while remaining one, is nonetheless able to embrace the similarities and the differences between the being-given proper, on the one hand, to the human spirit and, on the other, to absolute spirit. Nevertheless, only if the latter is gift can Bruaire validly argue that gift is the metaphysical name for being—and not merely its<br>

  Author(s) VON HEYKING JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Medieval political theory is often accused of being arcane and incapable of speaking to contemporary political problems. This appearance seems especially true when it comes to contemporary thinking on war: what do the likes of Tertullian, Origen, Ambrose, and others have to say about nuclear weapons, apocalyptic terrorists, dictators, and tribal genocide in postcolonial Africa? In fact, medieval political theory has a lot to say about these issues, and its voice is actually being heard in public discourse. For example, one can see the pacifistic tradition of Tertullian and Origen in the stance against war articulated by the American Catholic<br>

  Abstract: During the Middle Ages, traditions of blood feud, desires for conquest and power, and even the chivalric code of honor intensified the frequency and legitimacy of war. Yet war as an inescapable fact of life does not diminish the desire for peace; in fact it may intensify our human sense of its value. Because conflict was so terribly damaging to land and lives in medieval Europe, ensuring peace often meant controlling war, or at least some of the negative and destructive by-products of the seemingly interminable hostilities. Consequently, the desire for peace in the Middle Ages was intimately related to<br>

  Abstract: With the reign of Louis the Pious, the religious ideal of kingship and the vision of the Frankish empire as a sacred kingdom reached a radical high point—with ambiguous results, however, in the period of civil wars that clouded the last years of Louis’s rule. The governing elites, both the warrior nobility and the bishops themselves, accepted the hieratic vision of a sacred kingdom and the holy purposes of the Carolingian state, a fact that embittered every conflict. Just as “mirrors of bishops” had long ago devised the model of an ideal bishop, so now “mirrors of princes” were<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  HEIDEGGER’S RELIGIOUS-PHILOSOPHICAL  from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger began his career at Freiburg University in 1915 as an interpreter of the Catholic Middle Ages and as, to all appearances, a devout Roman Catholic: former seminarian and son of the sexton in Meßkirch. As his views on facticity and historicity developed, he became increasingly critical of “the system of Catholicism.” He came to believe that Catholicism inured itself from life through an architectonic of Scholastic concepts, a “pseudo-philosophy” with “police power” (GA60 313). Scholasticism (not identical to Catholicism in Heidegger’s mind but nonetheless inseparable from it) distorted Aristotle and compounded the forgetfulness of being already underway in antiquity<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  LUTHER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: The year 1917 was a turning point for Heidegger. Prior to 1917, he never openly questioned the Roman Catholic/Scholastic appropriation of philosophical methods into theology. After 1917, Heidegger began to regard Scholasticism as the site of the hegemony of theoretical speculative-aesthetic concepts in Christianity and the consequent forgetting of factical Christian life. The catalyst in this reversal was Heidegger’s discovery of Protestantism, Schleiermacher, Dilthey, and above all, Luther. We know Heidegger was reading Luther as early as 1909, although evidence of an intensive study of Luther only appears ten years later.¹ Heidegger came to believe that Luther had correctly identified<br>

  Abstract: Although there are several reports of information systems projects that have applied hermeneutics (Boland, 1991; Klein and Myers, 1999; Myers, 1994a), there are very few publications that explain the actual hermeneutic process taken by IS (and in fact, also non-IS) researchers.

  Abstract: As techniques for conceptual modelling, enterprise modelling, and business process modelling have proliferated over the years (e.g. Olle et al., 1991), researchers and practitioners alike have attempted to determine objective bases on which to compare, evaluate, and determine when to use these different techniques (e.g. Karam and Casselman, 1993; Gorla et al., 1995) . However, throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and into the new millennium, it has become increasingly apparent to many researchers that without a theoretical foundation on which to base the specification for these various modelling techniques, incomplete evaluative frameworks of factors, features, and facets will continue to proliferate.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbjjq">Negotiating the Sacred</a><br>
  Author(s) Seyit Kuranda<br>
  Abstract: Islam today, it would seem, has become inflexible and intolerant towards the teachings and ideologies of the West. When in fact, its history shows that it has always been accommodating to other peoples and beliefs, especially Christianity and Judaism. Most people know something of Islam. For instance, that it is one of the three monotheisms or the Abrahamic faiths and that it has much in common with Christianity and Judaism. Yet, there is so much that we do not understand about Islam and its overall world view. Islam is centred on the notion of peace, justice and community, yet when<br>

  Abstract: Debates over Globalisation and The War on Terror often accept that shifting agglomeration called The West as the bastion of secularism. Whether this is a progressive force of freedom and enlightenment or a profane, cold sweatshop machine, this secularism is established against an exotic Other of primal passionate faith or feudal, superstitious zealotry, depending on your position. My talk aims to examine this image of the West and to propose that the arationality associated with the sacred is not a feudal left-over, or even just a tolerated ′personal choice′.

  Abstract: In this chapter I will be looking at sacrilege in the context of Western European religion and politics in the early modern period. I will be adopting an historical-anthropological approach, with a view to making this discussion of sacrilege comparable with those of people working in other religious and cultural settings. Moreover, there is an important sense in which the societies of early modern Western Europe were themselves multicultural, not just because most contained diverse ethnic ′nations′, but more importantly because they contained mutually hostile religious communities. In fact, ′religious cleansing′ in early modern Europe provided the prototype for later<br>

  Abstract: Many people would be surprised to learn that they do not have unlimited power to give away their property as they choose. In fact, legal restrictions on gift giving operate upon gifts that take effect during the donor′s lifetime (
                  inter vivos gifts) as well as upon gifts that operate only upon the donor′s death (testamentary gifts). Some of these constraints are readily comprehensible; for example, it makes sense that the law would seek to protect donors against improper exploitation by would-be donees. Other legal constraints upon gift giving, however, are more difficult to explain. Why is it, for example, the<br>

  Author(s) JOAS HANS<br>
  Abstract: It is an undisputed fact that Karl Jaspers invented the term “Axial Age” in his 1949 book
                  Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte,but it is also uncontested that the basic idea behind the new term is much older and was not first developed by Jaspers himself. While these facts seem to be clear, the same cannot be said about the exact meaning of the concept of an Axial Age, the origins of the term, and the origins of the idea behind it. In the following, I will offer some material that could help to clarify these three matters, but<br>

  Abstract: “A total metamorphosis of history has taken place,” wrote Karl Jaspers sixty years ago in the immediate aftermath of World War II. “The essential fact is: There is no longer anything outside. The world is closed. The unity of the earth has arrived. New perils and new opportunities are revealed. All the crucial problems have become world problems, the situation a situation of mankind.”¹ But it was a spiritually empty unity. There was a universal economic and political interdependence, based on the universal permeation of technologies of dominance, but it did not rest on any common ethical foundation.“[S]omething manifestly quite<br>

  Abstract: My journey to grapple with Partition began when my grandfather remarked that despite the fact of Partition, he would gladly have continued to work in Lahore. I sat there stunned, not sure if he was serious. Why, he asked, don’t people work in Dubai? And wasn’t Lahore far closer than Dubai? In post-Partition India, Lahore felt a million miles further than Dubai. His vivid memory of the desire to stay on in Lahore, despite the high politicking that had resulted in Partition and despite the long years since Partition, formed an unanalysed silence.

  Abstract: In the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries, Persian literary humanism perforce exited its habitual home at royal courts and found its bearing in the context of a new imperial setting—something that it had always done, from its very conception during the Saffarid and Samanid periods in the eighth and ninth centuries down to its spread over four adjacent empires in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The only significant and traumatizing difference this time around, which turned out to be the liberating ordeal of Persian literary humanism, was the fact that Persian literati were now facing an

  Abstract: The cosmopolitan worldliness of Persian literary humanism commenced in a confrontation with the alienating imperium of Arab domination soon after the Muslim conquest of the Sassanid empire. Phase after phase this worldliness has planted itself in the context of multiple and successive global empires. The retrieving of these successive global worldings of Persian literary humanism from the sixteenth century forward narratively confronts its systematic de-worlding by both European Orientalism and its twin peak of colonially manufactured ethnic nationalism. Our understanding of Persian literary humanism has as a result been subjected to systematic appropriation and dispossession with every learned word that<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Encuentro con Lope en el Camino: from:

  Abstract: Canavaggio has commented that: ‘No se puede hablar de Cervantes sin encontrar a Lope en el camino’, a view substantiated by the fact that critical attention concerning Cervantes’s
                  Ocho comediashas prioritised the playwright’s unease with Lope’s highly popular theatre.¹ Canavaggio’s observation, however, is particularly reflective of studies ofLa entretenida,El laberinto de amorandLa casa de los celos. Each of these plays has been identified as a Cervantine reaction to dominant contemporary theatrical practise and all have been subject to analysis vis-à-vis Lope to varying degrees. This is especially true ofEl laberinto de amorandLa<br>

  CONCLUSION from:

  Abstract: In this study I have aimed, via an analysis of freedom, to draw conclusions regarding Cervantes’s
                  Ocho comediasas a counter-perspective to contemporary Golden-Age drama. Despite the fact that the dramatist’s writings for the stage clearly flout conventional Lopean parameters, it is not indicative of a theatre which is deficient or inferior. Rather, Cervantes constructs an aesthetic which permits free expression of seditious voices and an alternative stage for those discourses normally quashed by prevailing dramatic monopoly. It is precisely because of the restrictive nature of seventeenth-century Spanish theatre that Cervantes advocates a strategy of authorial liberty. For instance, in<br>

His landmark science fiction film does not attempt to free us somehow from our five senses, certainly. In fact, the film tends to enhance an appreciation of our perceptual faculties, particularly those of vision and hearing, as well as to encourage reflection on what we have experienced through our senses while watching the film.

And since writing an autobiography—in America, after Benjamin Franklin—often occurs with an awareness that the status of the work is bound up with the authority of its author, the notion of authorship also becomes troubled.¹ For instance, because an autobiography appears to be direct communication from its author, the very conditions of its presentation may suggest we are reading a true story, a mere record of what happened. Yet, like the life it aims to account for, autobiography is fashioned, a literary artifact, necessarily<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt3q4">Aquinas, Feminism, and the Common Good</a><br>
  Abstract: It is widely recognized that postmodernism has shaped contemporary approaches to theology and ethics.¹ Given this fact, a writer must make clear at the outset the ways in which she responds to the postmodern challenge regarding the use of classic texts and universal claims. However, the issue is not as simple as responding to a 
                  singular postmodern challenge.² Rather, the postmodern critique of modern, liberal, Enlightenment-based convictions holds within it a range of orientations toward purported universal truths. This book is a response to these postmodern positions. At the same time, it offers a constructive method for retrieving a classic<br>

  CHAPTER 11  The Hunting and the Haunting from:

  Author(s) Steele Peter<br>
  Abstract: I have written well over a hundred poems that are to one degree or another after works of art—usually paintings. When I was asked recently about the attraction of such a topic, it occurred to me that the attraction lies in part in the fact that those works are finished things: whether or not they sport actual frames, they are all in some sense framed. Another way of saying this is that they are the polar opposite of the chaotic; and for reasons in part instinctive and in part educational, I do love the manifestly coherent—a brick wall<br>

  Abstract: How do two senses of belonging relate—to a universal religion and to a particular society? How do two senses of allegiance relate—to God and to a state? How do two senses of identity relate—as believers and as citizens? These questions have been posed throughout both Christian and Muslim history, and a variety of answers have been given to them. Context has been a critically important factor in shaping not only the answers but also, prior to that, the very way in which the questions are shaped, as the following essays and presentations demonstrate.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt597">Power and the Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Collective memories have long influenced domestic politics and especially international affairs—a fact most recently exemplified by the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. The events and the memories resulting from them became powerful motivating forces for Americans almost overnight. At home, an infrastructure of commemoration quickly arose—in films like 
                  United 93 (2006); memorials including one unveiled at the Pentagon in September 2008 and the Tribute World Trade Center Visitor Center opened in 2006; and even in political campaign discourse, as at the 2008 Republican National Convention.¹ Yet, as with other collective memories worldwide, there<br>

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt597">Power and the Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Several common themes and conclusions have emerged from the contributions assembled in this volume. First, and perhaps not surprisingly, collective memories emerge in a variety of cultural and national contexts to greatly influence various foreign policies, bilateral relationships, and international affairs. Nevertheless, the ways in which collective memories become influential factors in decision making are not always as expected. The ways that memories are used as rhetorical weapons are often surprising. Although the emotions that are embedded in these memories-as-weapons are visceral and, as with other more conventional weapons, can be highly divisive and even dangerous.<br>

  Abstract: IT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS to say that children are full human beings. But as the history sketched in the previous chapter shows, it is not easy to explain what exactly this means. Leading thinkers’ efforts to describe children’s full humanity have resulted in one or another form of oversimplification. Of course, such is the case for any person or group. It is to some extent inevitable that talk about humanity is dehumanizing.

  CHAPTER II  The Problem of the Reality of the Unconscious from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8cj">Wittgenstein Reads Freud: The Myth of the Unconscious</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud has often been credited, if not with an actual “discovery” of the unconscious (which he had the wisdom not to claim entirely for himself), at least with the introduction of a revolutionary idea of its nature and function. It is less frequently noticed, however, that his vision of consciousness remained utterly traditional and bound to the idea of consciousness as the internal perception of “objects” of a certain type—the paradigm of clear and immediate perception. Ernest Tugendhat, among others, has rightly insisted on this fact, which is not inconsequential;¹ and indeed Freud’s conception of the nature of consciousness<br>

If war is hell, then civil war belongs to hell’s deepest and most infernal regions.

Close to 85 percent of the population lived in the countryside and made its living on or from the land.

  Abstract: Looking at contemporary humanity, one can hardly avoid the impression of a huge body or organism ravaged by multiple diseases and even catastrophes.¹ Even without detailed diagnosis, it is not hard to trace these ailments to a set of underlying factors or causes: political oppression or domination; radical inequality between rich and poor; xenophobia sometimes resulting in genocide; terrorist violence; and the abuse of religions and ideologies. If such ailments occurred on a small scale or in a limited group of people, efforts would quickly be made to find remedies to combat the existing ills. However, if they happen on<br>

  Abstract: History defies linearity. In a time when, at least in the Western world, major issues appeared to be settled and some even predicted the “end of history,” drama has suddenly erupted elsewhere—and especially in the Muslim world. A political arena that in many respects seemed relatively stagnant has unexpectedly been gripped by radical turmoil and revolutionary fervor. This does not mean that such turmoil is ever completely unprepared or unmotivated. Contrary to their portrayal (by some academics) as near-apocalyptic interruptions beyond intelligibility, revolutions have precursors or conditioning factors; usually they are the product of a deep social malaise, of<br>

  Abstract: In chapters 3 and 4, images of the artist have confirmed the profound affinity between masks and metaphors suggested by the introductory chapters on role-playing in photographs, letters, and interviews and also posited by the theoretical chapter. The analogy between the role-playing artist and the reader, who participates in the metaphorizing process, lies in the fact that both engage in an act of the imagination whose object is nothing less than to negotiate the tension between identity and difference.<br>

However, the study of a wider range of contemporary texts shows thatregionalis closely interrelated with the termnationaland occurs in a central debate (not just inThe Nationbut also inThe New Republicand in the African AmericanThe Messenger) on American identity and values at a time of fundamental crisis.

  Abstract: In this essay I would like to make the case for a kind of feminism in Johnson’s work, a feminism that makes visible foundational feminine virtues within African American culture in part by revealing the effects of strong women and in part by rendering the misogynism against which this feminism defines itself. My argument runs against the grain of most though not all work on Johnson. While critics focusing on racial hybridity in Johnson’s work have celebrated his integrationalist aesthetic (Little and Storhoff), those who have focused on gender have more often found Johnson’s fiction unsatisfactory.¹ Some even draw on<br>

  Abstract: Tragedies often confront us in our daily lives. This is a staple of the human experience or condition, and learning from them is what allows us to come up with theories and rules of life. Perhaps the most philosophical attitude we can take to these trials and tribulations appears in aphorisms such as “What doesn’t kill me strengthens me” and “What evil there is must be for some greater good” – sayings that depict our resignation to the unchanging nature of some things in life and our need to somehow manage.

  Abstract: Immigration, including the role of immigrants in Canadian culture, became a national issue by the summer of 2001, when Statistics Canada reported an ethnic and demographic makeover under way. The impact was analogous to the point in Hegelian analysis when Eve had to teach the facts of life to a rationalist and self-centred Adam, an archetypal Bad John. Just like the exemplary Adam, Canada was coming to know itself as a tragic hero: it was ageing and dying but wanted to live forever. As a self-consciousness, it had to realize that it was ultimately a

  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science? Reference to Marx’s and Engels’s (or even Lenin’s) work will not yield a satisfactory answer, although certain signposts are evident. For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the

  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  Author(s) HESS THOMAS B.<br>
  Abstract: In the first days of June, 1950, Willem de Kooning tacked a 7-foot-high canvas to his painting frame and began intensive work on 
                     Woman—a picture of a seated figure, and a theme which had preoccupied him for over two decades. He decided to concentrate on this single major effort until it was finished to his satisfaction.<br>

  Author(s) ARNASON H. H.<br>
  Abstract: […] As the title indicates, the present exhibition is really a double exhibition which not only surveys the present state of the Abstract Expressionists but follows in some detail the direction to which the name “Abstract Imagists” has been applied. It is a fact that from the late Forties to the present day certain painters, loosely grouped with the Abstract Expressionists, have rather been concerned through extreme simplification of their canvases—frequently to the dominant assertion of a single overpowering element—in presenting an all-encompassing presence. This “presence” could be described as an “image” in the sense of an abstract<br>

  Jackson Pollock from:

  Author(s) FRIED MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The almost complete failure of contemporary art criticism to come to grips with Pollock’s accomplishment is striking. This failure has been due to several factors. First and least important, the tendency of art writers such as Harold Rosenberg and Thomas Hess to regard Pollock as a kind of natural existentialist has served to obscure the simple truth that Pollock was, on the contrary, a painter whose work is always inhabited by a subtle, questing formal intelligence of the highest order, and whose concern in his art was not with any fashionable metaphysics of despair but with making the best paintings<br>

  Abstract: Motherwell: To give some idea of what must have taken place, I will have to emphasize the fact that my background up to 1940 had little to do with painting.

  Abstract: The most surprising fact about American art in the late 1950s is the dearth of well-written published material critical of or hostile to Abstract Expressionism. Since a conspiracy is entirely unlikely—even Senator Joe McCarthy never claimed to have uncovered any in the art world—more likely possibilities must be examined. […]<br>

  Chapter 7  The Fateful Separation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bm6t">Passage to Modernity</a><br>
  Abstract: Early Greek philosophy defined the terms in which Western thought was to formulate transcendence. The Ionian search for a ground of nature beyond its appearance as well as the Pythagorean distinction between a principle of intelligibility and the reality it renders intelligible made the relation from the more fundamental to the less fundamental an unavoidable issue. Classical Greek philosophy eventually resolved it by means of the form principle. The form resided within the appearing objects of which it constituted the intelligible essence, yet as determining factor it also surpassed them. In his dialogue

  Abstract: As brief as it may be, Pushkin’s lyric poem “The Hero” (“Geroi”), written in 1830, constitutes one of his poetical manifestos.¹ This short poem encapsulates Pushkin’s response to the cultural and historical polemics of his day. Moreover, it is both a metapoetical and metahistorical poem, constituting one of Pushkin’s most controversial statements on the relationship between art and history, the nature of truth, and the status of historical fact. The poem needs to be quoted in full.<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Book Title: Care of the Psyche-A History of Psychological Healing<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON STANLEY W.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, a distinguished historian of medicine surveys the basic elements that have constituted psychological healing over the centuries. Dr. Stanley W. Jackson shows that healing practices, whether they come from the worlds of medicine, religion, or philosophy, share certain elements that transcend space and time.Drawing on medical writings from classical Greece and Rome to the present, as well as on philosophical and religious writings, Dr. Jackson shows that the basic ingredients of psychological healing-which have survived changes of name, the fall of their theoretical contexts, and the waning of social support in different historical eras-are essential factors in our modern psychotherapies and in healing contexts in general.<br>

  Abstract: The ultimate basis for the practice of medicine, or healing by any other name, is the suffering of the patients and their explicit or implicit calls for help. Thus it is reasonable to assert that the primary function of a healer is to ease a patient’s suffering, while striving to cure a disease or ameliorate its effects. And the healer-sufferer relationship has long been recognized as a crucial factor in healing—for better or for worse, depending on the extent to which it has been characterized by trust and confidence on the sufferer’s part and a concerned, sympathetic, and humane<br>

  Abstract: Almost fifty years ago, as a young student at the University of Chicago, I received my preliminary initiation into the erotic mysteries of the Platonic dialogues from an ambiguous foreign prophet named Leo Strauss. As I was no Socrates and Strauss no Diotima, this initiation could not be entirely satisfactory. I had no difficulty in accepting Strauss’s central hermeneutical principle that the key to Plato’s teaching is the dialogue-form itself. What could be more self-evident than that Plato wrote dramas rather than treatises (albeit somewhat eccentric, not to say occasionally boring dramas like the

  Abstract: I propose to deal with the question of the relation between philosophy and ordinary experience. This sounds quite straightforward, but I am afraid that it is actually an unusually difficult problem. It is a striking fact of our century that philosophy has become increasingly concerned with ordinary experience, ordinary language, everyday life, or the life-world, to cite four often-used expressions. This concern is evident in both wings of the two major contemporary philosophical movements, which are popularly if inaccurately designated as the analytical and the continental or phenomenological schools. Interest in everyday or ordinary language has clearly been stimulated by<br>

  Abstract: It is a tenet of semiotic studies—and one to which I fully subscribe—that much of what we take to be natural is in fact cultural. Part of the critical enterprise of this discipline is a continual process of defamiliarization: the exposing of conventions, the discovering of codes that have become so ingrained we do not notice them but believe ourselves to behold through their transparency the real itself. Nowhere is this process more important or more powerful than in our perceptions of our own bodies. We think we know ourselves directly, but both the “we” that know and<br>

  2  Cognition and Consciousness from:

  Abstract: Cognitive psychologists and neuropsychologists like Marcel (1983ab), Humphrey (1983), Baars (1988), Weiskrantz (1988), and Schacter (1989) now understand consciousness as a formal system or capacity involving the direction, choice, and synthesis of nonconscious processes. This movement, however, has also been answered with renewed versions of the traditional functionalist and behaviorist rejections of the study of consciousness as anything other than an incidental by-product of computational capacity (Dennett, 1991). Consciousness is seen as private and hence outside scientific scrutiny, confabulated and deluded in its pretended access to cognitive process, and ultimately nonfunctional. Such a rejection is in fact central to the<br>

  Abstract: A third major group of studies of the outcome of psychoanalysis began in the 1950s and continues to this day. The project asks what factors observable during the diagnostic evaluation predict satisfactory analytic progress. In 1960 Peter Knapp and his coworkers reported a project designed to investigate the suitability for analysis of 100 supervised analytic cases. The investigation was limited because the cases were studied only through the first year of treatment. Inspired by Knapp’s work, Sashin, Eldred, and Van Amerongen (1975) studied 130 low-fee control cases that were treated by 66 student-analysts between 1959 and 1966. The patients ranged<br>

  Abstract: Systematic psychoanalytic research requires a body of data to investigate. Unfortunately, data about analyses adequate for research purposes are difficult to obtain, and much of the data that are available have been so transformed in the process of reduction that investigators cannot be sure of their meaning. The very fact that the data were collected may so affect the analytic process that the data do not adequately represent ordinary psychoanalytic work. Analysts who are willing to collect detailed data about their work may be highly atypical in other ways. Data that appear in published reports are usually chosen because they<br>

In this model, the task of the scholar is to evaluate the proximity or lack of proximity between Paul’s interpretations and the original meaning of the texts. By drawing on the concept of latent meaning, Mitchell Kim has drawn our attention to the fact that the original meanings are far from clear. It is a common experience that people “say more than they know,” so that hindsight can lead to an acknowledgment of “that’s what I<br>

  Abstract: What one can call ideational approaches typically explain Qohelet’s heterodox character as a strictly mental accomplishment or natural development of ideas, without much attention to sociohistorical factors. This way of explaining Qohelet’s dissidence has certainly been the dominant one throughout the centuries. It represents the typically theological approach of an older generation of scholars, before the advent of the now popular sociological approach.¹ With the ideational perspective, the book is often depicted as a polemic against traditional wisdom (as represented by Proverbs and the friends of Job) and its unwarranted optimism and dogmatism, without considering the sociological dimensions to these<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgqbx">Aquinas the Augustinian</a><br>
  Author(s) Goris Harm<br>
  Abstract: In contemporary discussions, Aquinas’s theory of the word plays a role mainly in certain philosophical issues, in particular the semantic and epistemological status of the inner word 
                     (verbum interius) or concept and the question whether Aquinas represents some form of direct realism or representationalism.¹ Generally, however, little attention is paid to the fact that Aquinas’s theory of the word evolved over the course of his career. This neglect can have serious consequences for the interpretation of Aquinas’s position.²<br>

  The Conversion of Jews to Islam from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Hatimi Mohammed<br>
  Abstract: The Islamic scholarly literature granted little place to the conversion of the Jews to Islam. Although Christians did so more often for many reasons, many Jews did convert and contributed toward shaping Muslim civilization. The absence of Jewish converts in the collective memory is linked in many cases to Islamic resentment at not having been successful in gathering the Jews, despite the fact that, early on, Muhammad had hoped to find in them an ally on which to build the new religion he was professing. It is therefore the refusal to convert that became a major theme in the Arabic<br>

  The Diverse Reactions to Nazism by Leaders in the Muslim Countries from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Abitbol Michel<br>
  Abstract: Nazi anti-Semitism is alien to Muslim cultures. That said, it would be an offense to history to overlook the fact that during World War II a number of authorities in Islamic territories hoped for the victory of the Axis powers. Apart from a few isolated cases we will discuss, these positions were not reached out of ideological sympathy with Nazism, the substance of which was generally unknown to the population. Rather, these authorities hoped that the defeat of France and England at the hands of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy would precipitate the end of Western colonialism, which the two<br>

  Qurʾan and Torah: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Gobillot Geneviève<br>
  Abstract: For a long time, the historical precedence of the Bible vis-à-vis the Qurʾan polarized the question of their interrelationship, reducing it solely to influence and borrowing, or even, in the case of extreme polemics, to plagiarism and parody. And yet, a simple shift in perspective allows us to view the question in a completely different light. In fact, the Qurʾanic text elaborates a discourse on its own status as scripture and on its relation to previous revelations. By starting with what the Qurʾan says about scriptural context, we find a whole universe of thought opening up to us, one that<br>

  Prayer in Judaism and Islam from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Hawary Mohamed<br>
  Abstract: Prayer holds a central place in both Judaism and Islam. It is at once an eminently spiritual and a very codified rite that places the emphasis on the proclamation of divine unity and the glorification of God. It has its source in the Holy Scriptures and represents an important point of reference for the Jewish and Muslim communities and a factor of unity for believers throughout the world. As is often the case in the two religions, the proximity between the discourses and prescriptions is striking, though major differences also exist. For example, there are parallels in the phases of<br>

  Jews, Islamic Mysticism, and the Devil from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Barry Michael<br>
  Abstract: Texts by Islam’s greatest mystics dealing with Jews, directly or through allusion, generally dismay—at least at first glance. Contrary to usual perceptions of medieval Sufism as somehow more “tolerant,” Jewish figures in actual Classical Sufi texts appear no less devilishly caricatural as any in medieval Christian literature or art. In fact, prevailing views of Jews in either dominant medieval culture—Christian or Islamic—appear luridly similar, with Jews depicted as spiritually blind creatures who rejected Divine Truth’s light as revealed through Jesus or Muhammad. Scorn and sarcasm characterize allegorical depictions of Jews by medieval Muslim poets and also manuscript<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz7m">Nation, Language, and the Ethics of Translation</a><br>
  Author(s) LEGRAND PIERRE<br>
  Abstract: Consider statutes and judicial decisions, two of the most common legal artifacts. If one accepts that statutes are not enacted by legislatures and that judicial decisions are not made by courts with a view to applying to foreign legal cultures, then legal borrowing across legal cultures is the practice of interrupting intention, which is a form of epistemic violence.¹ Statutes and judicial decisions nonetheless regularly find themselves being imported across legal cultures—that is, across cultures and languages—in order to underwrite local reforming agendas. In the process, these texts pass into new semiotic constellations. However, just as there cannot<br>

  Rethinking Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: Explorations of “experience” are never straightforward, however, for once we begin to clarify its nature, we run into a host of problems. The intimate, experiential side of homelessness or any other abjection is just as mythic and just as cultural as the public, horrific side. There are also questions of how one goes about knowing what other people experience and the rhetorical uses to which expressions of experience are put. In turn, any attempt to build effective theories of experience is complicated by the fact that people’s lives can entail very different ways of being. The category of experience is<br>

  Beautiful Ruins from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: For Kant, the “emotional satisfaction” produced by the sublime derives from the realization of the powers of Reason. For Burke, the pain and terror brought by the sublime achieve a catharsis; they “clear the parts, whether fine, or gross, of a dangerous and troublesome incumbrance.”¹ Yet it strikes me that any satisfaction achieved with a more modern sublime relates to the pleasure felt when standing in the midst of ruin. Meaning can tumble like a house of cards, the loss of a solid perceptual footing can undermine one’s identity, a building can fall apart. While one can witness or facilitate<br>

  How to Do Things with Feeling from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhjmz">Shelter Blues</a><br>
  Abstract: In the State Service Center, feeling was ensconced in rhetoric. The shelter was a place for all things psychological. A great deal of talk involved comments on or indications of states of feeling—such as when Carla said, “I just feel wretched. I really do,” at a group meeting. Although I did not keep count, overt references to feelings seemed more numerous in the shelter than in most other contexts. The high frequency of glossings had a lot to do with the fact that shelter life evolved around therapeutic care. Niko Besnier points out that “in probably all speech communities,<br>

  Abstract: In his study of the European conquest of America, Tzvetan Todorov asks how we are “to account for the fact that Cortés, leading a few hundred men, managed to seize the kingdom of Montezuma, who commanded several hundred thousand.”² According to Todorov, a sizeable European advantage lay in their ability to impose their own versions of truth on people who were epistemologically naive and who thus quickly “lost control of communication” to the invaders (61). Whereas indigenous Americans understood primarily a ritual use of language to maintain the status quo within a cyclic cosmological order, the European invaders were imperialists<br>

As women who commoditize their voices and bodies in contexts of public celebration (both outdoors at saint’s festivals, and indoors at wedding celebrations) shikhat (pl.) are often associated with the marketplace. In fact, women without moral scruples may be compared to shikhat who are “lost in the suq.”<br>

  3.  The Structure and Representation of the Cosmos from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhz90">Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</a><br>
  Abstract: Avicenna possessed an extraordinarily systematic vision of the structure of the cosmos—and of how it should be studied. Appreciating this fact is crucial if we are to understand his intellectual accomplishments; but it must also be kept in perspective. His passion for cohesiveness and completion led to the preoccupation with detail and demonstration that characterizes his logos writings: everything must fit, everything must hang together logically.¹ This being the case, it is not surprising that many later students of Avicenna, attracted by these very attributes of system, detail, and logical coherence, tend to view his philosophy through the prism<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fhz90">Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)</a><br>
  Abstract: Psychology, the study of the soul, held a particular fascination for Avicenna. That the subject clearly lies near the heart of his concern for philosophy is indicated by the fact that he devoted numerous major and minor tracts to the subject and returned repeatedly to its elaboration throughout his life.¹ Avicenna’s psychological doctrines are stable in their general parameters, but his individual presentations of them differ according to considerations of philosophical intent, generic format, and audience of address.² Like any psychology aspiring to comprehensiveness, Avicenna’s theory addresses four considerations:<br>

But where exactly does it begin, and where does it end? Should it include western Tanzania and southwestern Sudan? Should the Maniema and north Katanga be factored in as well?

No other region has experienced a more deadly combination of external aggression, foreign-linked factionalism, interstate violence, factional strife, and ethnic rivalries. Nowhere else in Africa has genocide exacted a more horrendous price in human lives lost, economic and financial resources squandered, and developmental opportunities wasted.

  Author(s) Black Joel<br>
  Abstract: It’s customary to credit Poe with elaborating all the conventions of detective fiction that subsequent practitioners of the genre have followed to a greater or lesser degree.¹ Yet Poe’s privileged role as founder or father of a literary genre—a role perhaps unique in literary history—has obscured the fact that he marks what can now be recognized as a first phase of the genre’s development. Key works of detective fiction in the twentieth century, especially in its latter half, represent a distinct departure from Poe’s “tales of ratiocination” and, indeed, from traditional hermeneutics.² Before we can delineate this later<br>

For this project, I will draw on the elective affinity between detective fiction and psychoanalysis, which is based—at least partly—on the fact that, like the criminal case, the psychoanalytic case is a knotty problem with death at its center. Jacques Lacan, in fact, defines human reality in general as “The Case of the Borromean Knot,” the structure he draws upon to describe the interrelated realms of the symbolic, the<br>

  Abstract: What does it mean, in Thoreau’s terms, to “suppose a case”? “To suppose,” as Stein suggests, is to substitute some faraway, remotely possible “instance” for one’s real position. (“Suppose” derives, in fact, from the roots of 
                  substitute and position.) A “case” is a set of circumstances or conditions. Supposing a case, then, must mean thinking in the subjunctive mood: imagining scenarios, developing hypotheses, speculating that “if this were the case,” or “in that case,” or even “in any case….” But “case” also has another meaning: a crime that requires investigation.¹ Indeed, the best way to solve such a case, according<br>

  Author(s) de Vries Marlene<br>
  Abstract: As a consequence of granting full civil rights to Jews in the European nation-states around the beginning of the nineteenth century, a difference between Jewish religion and Jewish culture could start to develop. In the Netherlands, or rather, the Batavian Republic as it was known at that time, civil emancipation became a fact in 1796. Once promoted to Dutch citizenship (or French or whatever), Jews no longer had to rely on the

Between 1996 and 2003, the immigrant contingent quadrupled to nearly 50,000 people, and the trend seems to point towards an even faster increase in years to come. Still, almost as important as this substantial increase in the numbers of immigrants is the fact that a vast majority of Basque people (88 per cent) have the impression that the foreign population has ‘skyrocketed’ in the last<br>

  Abstract: Postmodern and post-colonial discourses have praised hybridity and ambivalence as enriching traces of identity-building in our age of multidirectional migrations as if only travelling between and across cultures through transnational dislocations could provide the experience of developing diasporic, hyphenated or deterritorialised identities. But some authors are beginning to challenge what may be too narrow a perspective of the social conditions from which such identities can spring. The Portuguese sociologist Santos recently highlighted the fact that since its inception Portuguese colonialism has always been an experience of ambivalence and hybridity in the relationship it promoted between the coloniser and the colonised.<br>

  The Associational Attractions of the Musical from:

  Author(s) Jaques Pierre-Emmanuel<br>
  Abstract: In use again in the 1980s, the concept of attraction first provided a way to analyze the discourse features of early cinema. However, since his first article on this concept, Tom Gunning has not failed to note that attractions, far from disappearing with the development of integrated narrative cinema, continue to exist within certain genres: “In fact the cinema of attraction does not disappear with the dominance of narrative, but rather goes underground, both into certain avant-garde practices and as a component of narrative films, more evident in some genres (e.g. the musical) than in others.”¹ In the same article,<br>

  Abstract: In 1927, Boris Eichenbaum claimed for theory the right to become history.³ In 1969, in this very same room here in Cerisy, Gérard Genette affirmed it was more a necessity than a right: “a necessity,” he said, “that originates from the movement itself and from the needs of the theoretical work.”⁴ In his paper, Genette tried to explain why what he calls the “history of forms” took so long to establish itself. Along with a number of circumstantial factors, Genette stressed two causes that we would like to take into consideration. Let’s let him speak: “The first of these causes<br>

  Author(s) Gatti Hilary<br>
  Abstract: Giordano Bruno was born in Nola, near Naples, in 1548, and died in Rome in 1600, burnt at the stake as a heretic. That means he was born only five years after the first publication of Copernicus’s
                  De revolutionibusin 1543, and only thirty-odd years after Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic church had divided Europe and its culture into two militantly hostile factions.

  Abstract: There is probably no

However, the pre-history of such a turn – the turn itself consisting of a host of simultaneous intellectual processes rather than an abrupt moment of revolution – is a vaguer and largely unwritten story.¹ This vagueness in itself may be challenging and a key to such slow processes that cannot easily be detected in scientific manifestos, axioms or groundbreaking innovations.

  Abstract: If the humanities focus in some way on “the human,” including its meanings, diversities, constructions, and possibilities, then it would be curious to neglect the third of human beings who happen to be under the age of eighteen. This situation would appear all the more peculiar if the humanities are charged, as many argue, with challenging normative assumptions and investigating historically marginalized voices. Yet to a large extent children and youth do in fact occupy the periphery in contemporary humanities scholarship, arguably more so than any other social group. The oddness of this situation is compounded by the fact that<br>

  Abstract: If one is not born a woman, as Simone de Beauvoir and Monique Wittig so famously argue, then one is not really born a girl or boy either.¹ In fact, one is not necessarily born a child. Ever since Philippe Ariès posited childhood as an invention of modernity, childhood studies has argued for recognizing the state of prolonged protection (and sometimes fetishization) generally ascribed to Western youth as relatively constructed, class bound, and historically varied. Most of the world’s young can’t afford what many in affluent nations take for granted as universal: early years of total dependence, security, innocence, extended<br>

  Abstract: After seventeen years at a university in central Texas, I accepted a position in southern New Jersey. This fact is not so very surprising or even particularly interesting; academics relocate frequently and for a host of reasons. Two things, however, made this move somewhat unusual: I left a conventional, well-established discipline at the center of liberal arts curricula—English—to join a nascent multidisciplinary department in an emergent field, childhood studies. In what follows, I reflect on what this move has meant for me as a scholar of children’s literature. I also outline the creation of the Department of Childhood<br>

  Abstract: As a poet, I’ve always hated the fact that poetry often intimidates people. Many people I know feel that poetry is a test they can only pass if they are smart enough or sensitive enough, and most fear they will fail. Many refuse the test altogether—never read poetry—for fear of failure. Somehow something has gone wrong with poetry in our culture. We have lost touch with its value and purpose, and in doing so, we have lost contact with essential aspects of our own emotional and spiritual lives.<br>

  Author(s) RYDEN KENT C.<br>
  Abstract: The line between the idea of cultural region, generally delineated according to human criteria, and ecological region and bioregion, defined by natural factors, would seem to be fairly sharp and clear. Sometimes, though, that line becomes blurred in ways that force closer examination of these spatial concepts and the ways that they relate to each other. For example, northern New England can be seen as a distinct literary subregion distinguished by the differences that writers more or less self-consciously draw between dominant tropes of New England regional identity as a whole and the ways of life that they feel characterize<br>

  Abstract: A disclosure: in proposing “critical bioregionalism,” I assume that diverse bioregions are 
                  functionally homogenous. In other words, claims about the cultural life of bioregion X must be significant and meaningful to those who live in bioregion Y. As Pavel Cenkl observes in his essay in this collection, productive labor is one such function common to all bioregions; he argues that the qualities of that labor make the North both distinct from and comparable to any other bioregion. Absent the assumption of functional commonalities, one could only speak responsibly of a bioregional culture by celebrating its cultural artifacts and practices without<br>

  Author(s) Schneider William<br>
  Abstract: Years ago, Alan Dundes (1964) pointed out that stories contain at least three elements: text—what the story is about; texture—the way the story is told; and context—the circumstances surrounding the telling. These three elements are not always obvious and clear-cut, but the categories point to the fact that storytelling and comprehending its meaning depend upon an appreciation of what is said, the way it is expressed, and the particular setting that prompted the telling. These considerations have become basic to our understanding of

  Book Title: The Archaeology of Class War-The Colorado Coalfield Strike of 1913-1914<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

(Nevertheless, he removes himself in a very particular sort of way, because the designation is so general—and this is exactly the point—that it inevitably turns back around on the speaker. Since I say that “people are strange,” I include myself in a certain way in this strangeness.)<br>

If the sovereign is truly the one to whom the juridical order grants the power of proclaiming a state of exception and, therefore, of suspending the order’s own validity, then “the sovereign stands outside the juridical order and, nevertheless, belongs to it, since it is up to him to decide if the constitution is to be suspended

  Book Title: The Machine Question-Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Gunkel David J.<br>
  Abstract: One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the "animal question" -- consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the "machine question": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent--patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.<br>

You need look no further than the African American community to find evidence for this claim. As a people, African Americans were not easy converts to Christianity.

The deed was the result of a conflict between her family and another family in her village, belonging to the Mastoi clan. The Mastoi accused Mukhtaran’s twelve-year-old brother of assaulting a woman of their clan (in fact, it seems he had been seen talking to the woman in a field). The boy was therefore kept under lock and key by the Mastoi. In such cases, of conflict between families, Pakistani villagers often have recourse to a local tribal law council, a Panchayat.

  Abstract: After reading the three essays with your respective responses, my head was whirling with ideas. The diversity of approaches to the topic of dignity, family, and violence, to using the Bible, literature, and the complex problem of Assisted Reproductive Technologies as study resources indicate that we are experiencing a true intercultural dialogue. Intercultural and interdisciplinary dialogues are effective ways to become aware of the problems in other contexts, to learn from them, and to reflect on the facts in a critical and self-critical manner. In this regard, the objective has been achieved. However, you have asked for a third voice,<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

  Abstract: For some time now, the theme of discipleship in Mark has attracted my attention, for nowhere in the canon does a text generate in readers as much alienation from the disciples as in this Gospel (Kelber 1972; 1974; 1979; 1983). I continue to view it as a puzzle that admits of no simple or general answer. The very oddness of the theme ought to have inspired creative explorations, whereas, in fact, it has often given rise to evasive maneuvers.

  Abstract: In keeping with developments in the human and social sciences, we have for some time now experienced a recovery and reconsideration of the oral factor in biblical studies.

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: The game’s afoot in institutionalist research. As institutionalists grapple with change, diversity, innovation, indeterminacy, creativity, and surprising assemblages of institutional artifacts, some have come to question the implicit structuralist foundations of their research and turned elsewhere for help. The catalog is big and growing. Among other traditions, institutionalists have turned to social studies of science, action theory, ecology, narrative knowing, poststructuralism, constructivism, postcolonialism, pragmatism, theories of entrepreneurship, religious studies, and economic anthropology. This volume assembles a group of political scientists, whose only obvious commonality is their restlessness with structuralism and their commitment to alternative intellectual traditions to animate their research.<br>

  Chapter 3  Governance Architectures for Learning and Self-Recomposition in Chinese Industrial Upgrading from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Voskamp Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: For most of its post-1992 rapid industrialization, Chinese manufacturing excelled in global markets as a platform for high-volume and low-cost, export-oriented production.¹ Since China’s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, however, the fruits of rapid industrialization have been creating home market conditions for very different manufacturing strategies. Successful export-led industrialization has created more sophisticated domestic Chinese demand for a broad array of manufactured goods. In an effort to capture this emergent demand, Chinese producers are shifting their focus toward more advanced production and away from what was traditionally needed (or possible) within the framework of export processing relationships.<br>

  Chapter 6  Creating Political Strategy, Controlling Political Work: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Sheingate Adam<br>
  Abstract: A central theme guiding this volume is that politics is marked by everyday forms of innovation, what Gerald Berk and Dennis Galvan refer to as creative syncretism.¹ Focusing on this creativity, they argue, offers key insights into the nature and conduct of politics. What at first may appear to be fixed and rigid structures, such as rules and roles, interests and institutions, are in fact multiple and malleable elements of political life. This diversity allows actors to combine and recombine elements in pursuit of their political goals. The payoff from such an analytical move is twofold. First, attention to the<br>

  Chapter 10  The Trouble with Amnesia: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjkqq">Political Creativity</a><br>
  Author(s) Bruyneel Kevin<br>
  Abstract: In politics, time is a structuring force that shapes collective and individual identities, subjectivities, and imaginaries. We can see the role of political temporality in sweeping historical narratives, such as those a nation tells itself about its founding moment and subsequent arc of development, an arc that almost always legitimizes the status of the contemporary social and political order. We can see it in more quotidian forms such as the calendars that organize people’s lives and in so doing habituate citizens into annual practices of remembrance, memorialization, and obligation. These examples point to the fact that political time is a<br>

  Abstract: Several authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa were taken down in 2011, but this wave of challenges to strong states missed Algeria. In Algeria, large demonstrations in January 2011 and new efforts at political mobilization were overwhelmed by state security and could not continue. What Algeria lacked were the alliances built in other nations. Algeria’s civil war (1993–2000) left deep rifts and mistrust between groups.¹ Profound dissatisfaction with the state and desire for change could not take the place of the political work, underground or in open, of bridging interests and shaping alliances among democratic forces,<br>

  Abstract: If existence is indeterminate, open-ended and not predictable, then we dance as unfinished metaphysical artifacts in much the same way as phenomenology and evolutionary science explain how life is ongoing.
                     We are works in progress, in other words, and like works of art we live between content and process. Our living metaphysical reality does not mount to heaven, but spreads into our everyday dances—of auspicious being and indeterminate becoming.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjq68">Dancing Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: My experience tells me something quite different from the texts and dances of classicism and metaphysical dualism—that our transcendence is not won at the expense of flesh and body, nor is mind higher than matter: mater, matron, matrix, mother, the land. Rather, we pierce reality through the body, and we transcend downward as well as upward. The “descendental,” a word we do not use as much as its “transcendental” opposite, is that which descends to the matter-of-fact.¹<br>

When science developed better explanations for disease and more effective treatments, personal stories of illness were displaced from clinical settings in the United States and surfaced elsewhere. With the growth of the publishing industry, changed attitudes toward personal disclosure, patient activism about women’s health and AIDS, and the rise of the Internet, more people turned to the

  CHAPTER THREE  Unreal Stories: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vj9nz">A Self-Conscious Art</a><br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that Modiano is a ‘realist’. One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Being Playful: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vj9nz">A Self-Conscious Art</a><br>
  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes.

  CHAPTER THREE  Unreal Stories: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vj9nz">A Self-Conscious Art</a><br>
  Abstract: It is often assumed that Modiano is a ‘realist’. One reason for this is that his prose is representational, full of small and precise details in the manner of the Barthesian ‘effet de réel’. Many of these facts, moreover, have been discovered to be real; they are precise locations in Paris, or a particular brand of cigarette commonly smoked in France. Their authenticity has convinced some readers that the narrative which contains them must be a mimetic one. Another commonly held reason for considering Modiano a ‘realist’ is the combination of readability and alleged non-experimentation which characterises his novels; in<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Being Playful: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vj9nz">A Self-Conscious Art</a><br>
  Abstract: We have now seen numerous instances of Modiano at his most subversive. The apparently unremarkable first-person narrator, chronological narrative and realist representation have all turned out to be postmodern subversions of these familiar narrative tropes. So too has his use of historical facts: far from adding up to a historical novel, they result in an uneasy mixture of fact and fiction which has a morally disturbing effect on the reader. This leads us to a question of classification. Modiano’s novels are not what they seem, so we know what they are not: but what exactly are they? To what subgenre<br>

  4  How Europe Became Diverse: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbpw">The Cultural Values of Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Borgolte Michael<br>
  Abstract: The editors of this volume have commissioned contributions extending from the axial age in the sixth century b c to the present day. This is the first to mention Europe by name in its title.¹ This volume has been conceived in such a way that the question of how Europe became diverse is to be answered by a medieval historian. It is in fact possible to take the view that Europe, as the historical entity familiar to us, first emerged in the Middle Ages; on this view, despite the fundamental achievements of Greco-Roman Antiquity and the ongoing impact of the<br>

  8  The Affirmation of Ordinary Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbpw">The Cultural Values of Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Reinhard Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: When I consider all the unsolicited emails I receive every day, it seems to me that there are two main values for our contemporaries, money and sex, both quite everyday things. Now the world does not, of course, consist solely of spam, but on a somewhat higher level, in the case of professional and economic success measured in monetary terms, and in the case of love, we are in fact dealing with core values of Western culture and society. But they are so normal and everyday that they are scarcely perceived as values that function as guides to action.<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  Babel-babble: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjcgf">Ciaran Carson</a><br>
  Abstract: Translation is a longstanding and recurrent component of Ciaran Carson’s work, not only as practice, process, and artefact – as his recent book-length versions of Dante’s
                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  The Sorcerer and the Quimboiseur: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjd80">American Creoles</a><br>
  Author(s) Tamby Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: Édouard Glissant’s writing is deeply rooted in a strategy that challenges a hegemonic form of language use,¹ as described in detail by Celia Britton, with particular reference to his essays and novels (Britton, 1999). Miles Davis’s music, too, can be interpreted as a counter-discourse. The literature of the Caribbean and jazz music in the United States belong in fact to areas of cultural activity which have comparable histories despite their dissimilarities. A comparative approach to Glissant’s writing and the trumpet player’s improvisations can therefore allow us to reflect on the connections between strategies of resistance and, on the other hand,<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Maryse Condé: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgn6">Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World</a><br>
  Author(s) Leservot Typhaine<br>
  Abstract: How does one introduce Maryse Condé to the uninitiated reader? Condé’s centrality to Francophone studies and her popularity outside academic circles make this question more than merely rhetorical. Indeed, her fame has spread beyond the academic circle of scholars and students in Francophone studies – far beyond, in fact. English, German, Dutch, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish translations of her work testify to her growing global audience. Her oeuvre has earned her a number of accolades that reflect her widespread appeal: the French government named her Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2001 and Chevalier de la<br>

  CHAPTER 10  V. Y. Mudimbe’s ‘long nineteenth century’ from:

  Author(s) Fraiture Pierre-Philippe<br>
  Abstract: The concept of cultural conversion, understood in terms of its multifaceted intellectual significance but also in its concrete manifestations, lies at the heart of Valentin Yves (or Vumbi Yoka) Mudimbe’s oeuvre. Whether as a novelist, a poet, or an essayist (see Coulon, 2003), Mudimbe has dedicated a major part of his creative energy to tracing the emergence of Western modernity in sub-Saharan Africa and to the factors, epistemological and otherwise, responsible for the gradual transformation of the Congo where he was born on 8 December 1941 (in Jadotville, which became Likasi after independence).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjgn6">Postcolonial Thought in the French Speaking World</a><br>
  Author(s) Stovall Tyler<br>
  Abstract: Questions of immigration, diversity and race have dominated the social, cultural and political life of France since the late twentieth century. Even before the widespread uprisings in the
                  banlieues(France’s deprived suburbs) in the autumn of 2005, the question of how the French might conceive of themselves as a nation that could (or could not) embrace peoples of different origins and traditions fuelled seemingly endless debates among intellectuals, politicians and people of all walks of life. The riots themselves focused attention as never before upon the fact that large numbers of French citizens not only resented police harassment and lack<br>

  Book Title: The Poetry of Saying-British Poetry and its Discontents, 1950-2000<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHEPPARD ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: In The Poetry of Saying Robert Sheppard explores an array of ‘experimental’ writers and styles of writing many of which have never secured a large audience in Britain, but which are often fascinatingly innovative. As a published poet in this tradition, Sheppard provides a detailed and thought provoking account of the development of the British poetry movement from the 1950s. As well as analysing the work of individual poets such as Roy Fisher, Lee Harwood and Tom Raworth The Poetry of Saying also examines the influence of the Poetry Society and poetry magazines on the evolution of British poetry throughout this period. The overriding virtue of the poetry of this period is its diversity, a fact that Sheppard has not ignored. As well as providing a fascinating into the work of these poets, The Poetry of Saying offers an ‘insider’s’ commentary on the social, political and historical background during this exciting period in British poetry.<br>

  Author(s) WAWN ANDREW<br>
  Abstract: On 7 September 1871, a middle-aged Englishman stood on the railway station in Edinburgh. He was short, fat, red-faced, bull-necked, bush-bearded and ‘quite bewildered’.¹ He had been away from Britain for the whole summer; everything now looked very strange and he hardly knew where to buy a ticket for. He had been to Iceland and enjoyed it. The last words of his journal account of that visit leave us in no doubt about this: ‘Iceland is a marvellous, beautiful and solemn place ... where I had been in fact very happy.’ He was still happy enough when he arrived home<br>

  2  Visualizing the Famine: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: If twentieth-century attempts to give visual form to Famine memory are to be understood within a tradition of Famine image-making, the obvious antecedents lie in the visual representations of the Irish Famine from the nineteenth century. How was the Famine visually represented and interpreted in its own time, and what meanings do such images communicate? The evolution of the visual culture and representational history of ‘the Famine’ has yet to be satisfactorily mapped, and the relationship of its nineteenth-century iconography to latter-day visualizations both troubles and intrigues. This central question of how ‘famine’ (conceptually and historically) might be represented in<br>

  Book Title: French Studies in and for the 21st Century-  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Worton Michael<br>
  Abstract: French Studies in and for the 21st Century draws together a range of key scholars to examine the current state of French Studies in the UK, taking account of the variety of factors which have made the discipline what it is. The book looks ahead to the place of French Studies in a world that is increasingly interdisciplinary, and where student demands, new technologies and transnational education are changing the ways in which we learn, teach, research and assess. Required reading for all UK French Studies scholars, the book will also be an essential text for the French Studies community worldwide as it grapples with current demands and plans for the future.<br>

This unilateral africanisation of the Paris-born phenomenologist compels the reader to pause and think about the many fault lines but also intellectual and imaginary overlaps between Africa and Europe. Where does the former start and where does the latter stop? There are of course objective geographical facts and undeniable ethnic markers to corroborate the idea that Africa and Europe are distinct entities with neatly defined boundaries.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjnd2">Thresholds of Meaning</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the last thirty years or so, critics and cultural commentators in France and elsewhere have regularly – often with irritation, sometimes with gloomy defeatism and occasionally with a touch of
                  Schadenfreude– drawn attention to what they believe to be the current ‘crisis’ or even decline of the French novel. These comments are, of course, part of a much more general context in which France has seen its cultural influence in the world undermined by among other factors: competition from the New York and London art markets, the impact of American cinema on French box-office receipts, the popularity of<br>

  Author(s) Kissling Paul J.<br>
  Abstract: Although most traditional scholarship, situated as it has been in militaristic societies, describes the battles depicted in Joshua as a “conquest,” in fact the two major phases of that “conquest” are self-defense, first against an attack by a coalition of kings from the south of Canaan against the Gibeonites, who had recently joined Israel, and then defense against an attack on all of Israel by a coalition of kings from the north. The absorption of outsiders preceding an anticipated battle, the hyperbolic language of total destruction, the rules regarding the spoils of war, the extraordinary (divine) interventions, and the self-defensive<br>

  The Invention of Language in the Poetry of Job from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjz47">Interested Readers</a><br>
  Author(s) Greenstein Edward L.<br>
  Abstract: The book of Job, particularly its poetic core, appears to contain more unique words and linguistic usages than any comparable work from the ancient Near East. The distinctive language of Job has been attributed to a number of literary factors. For one thing, the characters and events are set in a much earlier, legendary period—the time of the patriarchs.¹ Not only does Job enjoy a lifestyle that is reminiscent of the rural, sheep-and-goat-herding Hebrew patriarchs, but the description of Job and his situation in the narrative framework of the book features language and allusions to the stories of Genesis.²<br>

  Abstract: Many reflective persons today continue to investigate the deceptive nature of language. In the particular case of philosophy’s perennial struggles with religion, language continues to be at the centre of much critical attention. For without sustained and careful attention to the vagaries of language, taking the critical measure of the sense and significance of the dynamic relations between religious experience and its quite various reflective articulations cannot be satisfactory.²<br>

For without sustained and careful attention to the vagaries of language, taking the critical measure of the sense and significance of the dynamic relations between religious experience and its quite various reflective articulations cannot be satisfactory.²<br>

  Author(s) Leighton Denys P.<br>
  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics. The increasingly ahistorical philosophical hermeneuticists, in turn, usually prioritize exposition and internal analysis of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkgzz">Mindscapes</a><br>
  Author(s) Nida-Rümelin Martine<br>
  Abstract: According to some philosophers qualitative experience cannot be naturalized in the following sense: There are facts to be known about experiences that can only be expressed in phenomenal terminology. One candidate is the fact expressed by “the sky appears blue to Peter” or the fact expressed by “the pig feels pain.” Let us call a fact that can only be expressed in phenomenal terminology and that thus cannot be expressed in physical terminology a non-physical fact.² There has been a controversy about whether there are such non-physical facts.

  Author(s) van Gelder Tim<br>
  Abstract: After connectionism burst into prominence in cognitive science in mid-1980s, one of the most popular questions among philosophers of cognitive science was: what implications does it have for the philosophy of mind? (See, e.g., Horgan and Tienson 1991; Ramsey, Stich, and Rumelhart, 1991). Ten years later, it seems that the verdict is in. If we suppose that the term
                  connectionismrefers to some reasonably coherent research program standing as an alternative to mainstream computational cognitive science, then connectionism hasnointeresting implications for cognitive science. This is because there is, in fact,no suchthing. There are lots of connectionist<br>

  Abstract: The city would not exist as a modern urban society without the urban public domain. This is the central claim of a large number of theories of urban culture.¹ After all, urban life is defined by the fact that we are forced to share the city with a multitude of strangers from disparate backgrounds and with diverse identities and interests. For this reason it is of great importance that there are public spaces where we encounter these “others”, are confronted by them and must relate to them.

Since the 1960s, in which the word “ludic” became popular in Europe and the United States to designate playful behaviour and artefacts, playfulness has increasingly become a mainstream characteristic of our culture. Perhaps the first thing that comes to mind in this context is the immense popularity of computer games, which, as far as global sales are concerned, have already outstripped Hollywood.

What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits.

The “tragic feeling of life” results from the most difficult question ever to face philosophy: how to justify its pursuit of reason as a worthy facet of a life well lived.

  On Three Early Incidences of Hebrew Script in Western Art from:

  Abstract: Though some have theorized that the Hebrew script in the trilingual titulus of the fourteenth-century
                  Crucifixionby Giotto is the first appearance of Hebrew in Western art, the script in fact began to appear in that circumstance at least two centuries earlier, at the beginning of the twelfth century. Major changes in the Church’s relationship with the Jews occurred between these earliest appearances. For purposes of understanding the significance of the earlier date, the most important change was the renewal (following Jerome [347–420]) of Hebrew study among Christians.

Her relationship to Jesus was unusual and out of line within the context of Carmelite spiritual practice. She saw Jesus as a Jew before Christian theologians took this fact seriously, but her mystical marriage to him reveals that she advanced in her interior life an unambiguous supersessionism that demands the replacement of Judaism with Christianity. For Stein, this interior devotion to her husband, Jesus the Jew, was a form of spiritual resistance<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet is re-emerging as a major figure in twentieth-century intellectual history. As the person who introduced Russia to phenomenology, he has had a powerful impact on a wide range of intellectual debates in Russia and beyond. This impact, however, was ignored or consciously downplayed in the USSR. Starting in the 1930s, Shpet became largely invisible in official Soviet scholarly discourse, a tendency that was only exacerbated during the decades after his execution in 1937. This tendency is one of the factors that contributed to Shpet's being so little known in the West today.<br>

Whereas the two methodologies and discursive practices may not appear commensurable on the surface, there emerge beneath important philosophical convergences between Shpet and Voloshinov.

  Abstract: Motoori Norinaga, the preeminent scholar of the early modern nativist movement known as
                  Kokugaku,was born to a cotton wholesaler in the town of Matsusaka. In 1852, he went to Kyoto to study medicine, where he also enrolled in the school of the Confucian scholar Hori Keizan (1689–1757). Through the course of his studies, which included native poetic and prose traditions, Norinaga was informed by two hermeneutical approaches. The first was that of Ogyū Sorai*, who advocated a return to the study of the original, primary texts of Chinese Confucianism in order to ascertain the “true facts” of the<br>

  Ienaga Saburō 家永三郎 (1913–2002) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqg76">Japanese Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Saburō Ienaga<br>
  Abstract: Historian and philosophical critic, Ienaga Saburō is one of those modern thinkers who defies classification. He is especially well known for his open criticisms of Japanese narratives of World War II. In 1953 he wrote a Japanese history textbook, which was censored by the Ministry of Education due to “factual errors,” and Ienaga filed a lawsuit against the Ministry in a well-publicized case. The selection below focuses on another side of Ienaga and offers in translation an excerpt from the second chapter of his ambitious first book,

  Abstract: The stereotype holds that practitioners abandoned society to pursue their esoteric arts, but as we have seen their relations with local communities were, in fact, exponentially more complex than that. They functioned in society as a type of holy person, in part by absenting themselves from normal patterns of social interaction and taking up instead the behaviors identified with the role of
                     xian-hood-seeker, but these behaviors included many relations with others. We now turn to the social relations of practitioners with their own families and with representatives of the imperial bureaucracy.<br>

  Abstract: As a century and, indeed, a millennium draw to a close, we stand today perhaps at the most open moment in the history of humankind. The cultural synthesis that it has taken the West well over four hundred years of the departing millennium to forge and which brought power and wealth to the West, but also a pervasive improvement in the material condition of humankind at large during the waning century is losing its once matter-of-fact validity and persuasiveness. The world a hundred years ago was in a very fundamental sense one. The world was ruled by the West—which<br>

  Abstract: As imperial designs on the world expanded their scope in the latter half of the eighteenth century, and more of the earth’s surface was subjected to scientific description, so geographical knowledge also spread. This enlarged field of facts did not, though, exercise any great influence over the way geographers conceived of the foundations of their discipline. Their aim remained much the same: to use the tools of inductive reasoning to reduce the variety of the earth’s natural features to certain universal principles. Movement was a prerequisite of geographical knowledge. But it formed no part of geography’s representation of the world.<br>

  Abstract: It is extremely difficult to determine exactly when the writing script of ancient China began to diverge from speech. Bernhard Karlgren estimated that Chinese writing and speech started to part ways at the beginning of the Christian era, which was roughly equivalent to the end of the Western Han period (206 b.c.–a.d. 22): “In the written language from the pre-Christian era right down to our own day, people have continued to use the original short and concise word material; in other words, the authors have continued to write classical Chinese, regardless of the fact that the spoken language had<br>

The discussion, I hope, helps elucidate the fact that much of the narrative discourse indeed took shape in an oral milieu, with many elements characteristic of oral literature intact or discernible in its present textual form. Of course, the voice of the storyteller is gone forever, and it is only in the form of the printed text that the narrative exists today. The current chapter addresses the issue of the textualization of the work. My argument here<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1870s when Chinese Protestant literature began making inroads into Korea and especially since the 1880s when missionaries from the United States began arriving in the peninsula, Protestantism made rapid progress in Korea. By the end of the twentieth century, as Donald Baker and Timothy S. Lee discuss in this volume, every fifth South Korean was a Protestant. Many a factor—ranging from the sociopolitical to the religious—has been proffered to explain this rapid growth. This is all good and proper: no relevant factor should be neglected if we are fully to appreciate the complexity and richness of<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Book Title: Literature and Subjection-The Economy of Writing and Marginality in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Legrás Horacio<br>
  Abstract: Through theoretical, philosophical, cultural, political, and historical analysis, Horacio Legras views the myriad factors that have both formed and stifled the integration of peripheral experiences into Latin American literature. Despite these barriers, Legras reveals a handful of contemporary authors who have attempted in earnest to present marginalized voices to the Western world. His deep and insightful analysis of key works by novelists Juan José Saer
      (The Witness),Nellie Campobello(Cartucho),Roa Bastos(Son of Man),and Jose María Arguedas(The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below),among others, provides a theoretical basis for understanding the plight of the author, the peripheral voice and the confines of the literary medium. What emerges is an intricate discussion of the clash and subjugation of cultures and the tragedy of a lost worldview.<br>

  Abstract: In this article an instrumentalist conception of action interpretation will be developed. This conception shall be suitable for interpreting moral actions as well as other actions. The approach’s instrumentalism consists in the fact that interpretations here are conceived as means for fulfilling a certain function, in particular for providing a certain type of information about the action. After these preliminary remarks it will be explained which kind of information we expect from action interpretations (section 1). In the subsequent section it will be discussed which model of action and action interpretation in principle could provide this information (section 2). In<br>

  Abstract: Reflection on olfactory and gustatory perceptions and their epistemological status has not been playing a major role in the philosophical tradition. Most classical philosophers deal with the senses of smell and taste rather parenthetically and with a sense of flippancy—if at all.¹ Sometimes philosophical texts cite phenomena of smell and taste where exemplification in factually unrelated, particularly abstract contexts is needed²—as if the difficulties of abstraction might be evened out by choosing examples from an area of life that is surrounded by a sense of light-heartedness and concreteness.

      Listening Long and Late.With refreshing authenticity, Everwine weds playfulness to practice, lyricism to narrative, pathos to the ordinary. Indeed, he has listened 'long and late' to the music of such venerable masters as Tu Fu, the hidden genius on the street, and the anonymous Aztec poets of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Everwine writes with the same 'deified heart' that divines the mystery of his quotidian subjects in a language that is at once plain and poetic. His own work seamlessly segues into his translations from the Hebrew and Nahuatl, as if all the poems belonged to the same poet, which they in fact do, as the glorious multitudes of Peter Everwine, one of the masters of our age."-Chard deNiord<br>

  Abstract: The ecological damage that has led to an emerging sixth world extinction event may not be derived entirely from Western modernity.

  Abstract: Radović ultimately argues for the power of literary imagination to contest the limitations of geopolitical boundaries by emphasizing space and place as fundamental to our understanding of social and political identity. The physical places described in these texts crystallize the protagonists' ambiguous and complex relationship to the New World. Space is, then, as the author shows, both a political fact and a powerful metaphor whose imaginary potential continually challenges its material limitations.<br>

  Abstract: Caribbean discourse and literature open a unique possibility for an innovative rereading of spatial and postcolonial theories in conjunction. The Caribbean has always been contested space, historically fought over and swapped among various colonial powers while conceptually cast as either the abyss of the slave plantation or the garden of worldly paradise. Engaging with various discursive representations of this ambiguity of Caribbean space, I address in this chapter the polarized visions of Caribbean postcoloniality between brutal colonial facts and powerful images of their contestation. These gestures of creative resistance, often formulated through spatial metaphors, offer deliberately provisional “third” solutions against<br>

Gershom Scholem’s classic essay “Redemption through Sin” remains one of the most influential essays written not only in Jewish Studies but in the History of Religions more generally.¹ It was a tour de force, serving at once as programmatic seed, historiographic manifesto, research agenda, and transvaluational breakthrough. Even after many translations and republications, this essay remains positioned in Scholem’s corpus as a vital synthesis of his innovative creativity. But the paradoxical morality articulated by Scholem in “Redemption through Sin” only appears to be utterly novel. In fact, it emerges more and more clearly<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  J. A. Hobson as a Political Theorist from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rh6k">Liberal Languages</a><br>
  Abstract: J. A. Hobson was one of the half-dozen most influential political thinkers in late-nineteenth—early-twentieth-century Britain, a fact that even the partial revival of his fortunes has infrequently brought to light. The main reason for this oversight has two complementary facets: Hobson’s contribution lay chiefly in his formulation of a liberal version of British welfare thought, an ideological genre that until recently was accorded insufficient recognition; and, conversely, recourse to conventional modes of political theorising, utilising existing traditions, or referring to the constructs of leading individuals, was not paramount in his work. It is symptomatic that in the various reading<br>

  2  BEGINNINGS TO 300 B.C.E.: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rk2m">Birth of the Symbol</a><br>
  Abstract: When porphyry refers (repeatedly) to Homer’s cave of the nymphs as a σύμβολου of certain hidden meanings, he is using the term in a sense that appears only in the postclassical period in ancient Greece. The early Greek term meant something quite different—so different, in fact, that we will be forced to wonder just how it developed a literary sense at all. These earliest manifestations of the Greek symbol provide insights into the trajectories the notion later follows. Of course, they do not and cannot be asked to provide some authentic glimpse of the “true” or “real” symbol, as<br>

  III  Anti Anti-Relativism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rkn7">Available Light</a><br>
  Abstract: A scholar can hardly be better employed than in destroying a fear. The one I want to go after is cultural relativism. Not the thing itself, which I think merely there, like Transylvania, but the dread of it, which I think unfounded. It is unfounded because the moral and intellectual consequences that are commonly supposed to flow from relativism—subjectivism, nihilism, incoherence, Machiavellianism, ethical idiocy, esthetic blindness, and so on—do not in fact do so and the promised rewards of escaping its clutches, mostly having to do with pasteurized knowledge, are illusory.<br>

  Abstract: The death of Thomas Kuhn—“Tom” to all who knew him, and considering his principled refusal to play the role of the intellectual celebrity he clearly was, an extraordinary number of people did— seems, like his professional life in general, on the way to being seen, in these days of pomos and culture wars, as but another appendix, footnote, or afterthought to his

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rkn7">Available Light</a><br>
  Abstract: Political theory, which presents itself as addressing universal and abiding matters concerning power, obligation, justice, and government in general and unconditioned terms, the truth about things as at bottom they always and everywhere necessarily are, is in fact, and inevitably, a specific response to immediate circumstances. However cosmopolitan it may be in intent, it is, like religion, literature, historiography, or law, driven and animated by the demands of the moment: a guide to perplexities particular, pressing, local, and at hand.<br>

  Abstract: Hamlet’scentral position as a moment of transition between the early period of Shakespeare’s more brilliant and happy mood toward the years of his mature tragic art can be considered as an acquired fact in almost any modern reading of his best known and most celebrated play. Those who wish to underline Shakespeare’s position in the course of British history between the end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth, whenHamletwas written and acted for the first time (1600–1601), often explain this dramatic change of mood by pointing to the final years of the<br>

  9  BRUNO AND THE STUART COURT MASQUES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rmc2">Essays on Giordano Bruno</a><br>
  Abstract: It has long been known that Bruno’s fourth Italian dialogue,
                  Lo spaccio della bestia trionfante, written and published in London in 1584, was used as a source by Thomas Carew for his masqueCoelum britannicum.¹ This was Carew’s only masque but it was by no means a minor event within the Stuart calendar of court entertainments. However, in spite of general agreement on the quality ofCoelum britannicumas one of the major entertainments of the Stuart Court, the use by Carew of Bruno’s dialogue has never been extensively or satisfactorily commented on. Both Bruno and Carew scholars have clearly<br>

  15  BRUNO AND METAPHOR from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rmc2">Essays on Giordano Bruno</a><br>
  Abstract: Giordano bruno was born only five years after the first publication of Copernicus’s
                  De revolutionibusin 1543, and only thirty-odd years after Martin Luther’s excommunication from the Catholic Church had divided Europe and its culture into two militantly hostile factions. Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities. This chapter will primarily be concerned with his thinking about language, and especially with his thoughts about metaphor, thus aligning itself with an interpretative model of early<br>

  Book Title: A Theory of the Trial-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burns Robert P.<br>
  Abstract: Anyone who has sat on a jury or followed a high-profile trial on television usually comes to the realization that a trial, particularly a criminal trial, is really a performance. Verdicts seem determined as much by which lawyer can best connect with the hearts and minds of the jurors as by what the evidence might suggest. In this celebration of the American trial as a great cultural achievement, Robert Burns, a trial lawyer and a trained philosopher, explores how these legal proceedings bring about justice. The trial, he reminds us, is not confined to the impartial application of legal rules to factual findings. Burns depicts the trial as an institution employing its own language and styles of performance that elevate the understanding of decision-makers, bringing them in contact with moral sources beyond the limits of law.<br>

  Abstract: This book grew out of a long attempt to understand an epiphany, one I have experienced and that seems often to occur in American trial courts. In the course of trial there emerges an understanding of the people and events being tried that has a kind of austere clarity and power. This experience surprises and “elevates” the participants, including the jury.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rnt9">A Theory of the Trial</a><br>
  Abstract: What is a trial? The simplicity of the question is deceptive. Since Socrates began posing such “What is . . .” questions about human practices, we have learned that these apparently straightforward factual questions quickly open out into an ideal realm whose limits are always indeterminate. We do not really
                     understandwhat a trial is unless we understand the interrelation between what we may only provisionally call “what a trial is” and “what a trial can aspire to be.” For us, “factual” questions become practical questions, such as, “How should we shape our public life?”<br>

  II  The Trial’s Linguistic Practices from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rnt9">A Theory of the Trial</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the fixed points of the social scientific study of the trial is that the juror makes his or her decision after an intense encounter with the evidence, and it is the evidence in the case, more than any other factor, that determines the outcome.³ The juror performs his or her task only after this highly structured language-centered event: the trial itself. The trial is usually over immediately after this encounter, since jury deliberation “changes” the result in fewer than one in ten cases. The initial majority almost always prevails.⁴ Before we focus in greater detail on the

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rnt9">A Theory of the Trial</a><br>
  Abstract: The trial makes possible different levels of normative judgment. Some are closely connected to factual accuracy, though not in the way that the Received View suggests. Other levels of judgment recognize that the trial is a public event, and that its task is not only to do justice but to preserve the conditions for the doing of justice. Thus the key task in most trials is to identify what is most

  Abstract: The sense in which a verdict can be said to be correct under the Received View seems relatively straightforward:¹ a verdict will be correct if it is based on accurate fact-finding followed by legal categorization that respects the meanings of the key terms in the instructions. From that perspective, it is difficult even to think of a verdict as “true.”² “Justified” or perhaps “correct,” but never quite “true.” I have proposed another understanding of what, concretely, the trial has become for us that I argue is fair to the different sources of evidence, and have invoked “the mutual support of<br>

  CHAPTER EIGHT  From Ritual to Askēsis from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rs06">Reading Renunciation</a><br>
  Abstract: In some quarters, the study of ritual has shifted emphasis in recent decades. Scholars have gradually abandoned the functionalist view that ritual serves to create social unity,¹ stressing instead its marking of social difference. In part, this shift signals a dissatisfaction with functionalism’s inherently conservative emphasis on “societal balance,” on the preservation of the
                  status quo.² Informed by a more sharply critical analysis, theoreticians now note the gaps, the distinctions, the discrepancies of a society that ritual, far from healing, instead underscores and maintains. Differentiation is here seen as an activity that can be examined through a focus on ritual.³<br>

It is a voyage intersected by other voyages; each time the pilgrim meets a soul, his lifeline intersects another lifeline. In hell he encounters failed voyages, journeys that have ended in failure. Ulysses’ special stature within the poem derives in no small measure from the fact that his lifeline concludes with a literal voyage that has literally failed, so that he, alone among<br>

  Abstract: We turn now to the
                  Paradisoand to the problems of recounting the unrecountable. Due to our habit of conflating theCommedia’sform with its content, the exegetical tradition has produced a theologized reading of the third canticle that portrays it as cloyingly serene (no doubt a factor in its undeserved reputation as boring). In recent years, the old critical commonplace of a serene and problem-free third canticle has been given a metapoetic twist; we hear now about the difficulties of writing theInferno, difficulties that presumably lessen as the poem proceeds. As indicated earlier, such readings unacceptably theologize the<br>

  Abstract: We have just been exploring the contrasting but related activity of the poem’s two protagonists, Son and Satan, in Book 10. This opposition, which is essential to the combat myth Milton is retelling, is actually signalled very early in the poem and pervades it from then on. But so many things are happening in the first few lines of
                  Paradise Lostthat we are in danger of missing the wood for the trees. Thus we may miss the fact, obvious enough when we think about it, that the narration places two symbolic animals close to the beginning. First, as the<br>

  Author(s) Morrison Rebecca<br>
  Abstract: This article offers several preliminary views on the sources of Soviet authoritarianism, which I seek to locate within the popular culture of the prerevolutionary peasantry. The essence of my hypothesis rests on a fundamental reality of life in the prerevolutionary Russian countryside: authoritarian relations served as the basic model for all interpersonal relations among peasants, including social relations. This was a result of the fact that the peasantry’s primary social institutions—the family and the commune—were authoritarian, cultivating, through socialization, authoritarian personalities. The Russian peasantry (which accounted for more than 80 percent of Russia’s population in 1917) and Russian<br>

  Abstract: It is an unquestionable fact,” wrote an anonymous American observer in 1893, “that in Russia all the principal outward adjuncts of modern civilization—large towns, factories, railroads, hotels, etc.—exercise a blighting effect on the beautiful old folk-song. This disappears at the sound of the steam whistle, and is gradually superseded by commonplace melodies with stupid words, not seldom of doubtful propriety.”¹ Similar expressions of concern at the alleged demise of traditional folk music were being voiced at the same time in Russia itself in the course of an extended public discussion that lasted from the 1870s until the early<br>

  Eight  The Biology of Traumatic Memory from:

  Abstract: The birth of PTSD followed a historical transformation in psychiatric knowledge making. Out of these changes emerged an invigorated psychiatric science that identified progress with the accumulation of facts by means of testable hypotheses: “Hypotheses prove themselves superior … by surviving strenuous attempts at disconfirmation. Science advances by the replacement of falsified theories by yet to be falsified ones” (Wallace 1988:140). Psychiatric writers associate “testability” with Karl Popper’s epistemology of falsificationism (Faust and Miner 1986). There are important differences between Popperian falsificationism and knowledge making in psychiatric science, though, and I will use the term “fallibilism” when I refer to<br>

  Abstract: In 1994, the American Psychiatric Association published a fourth edition of its official nosology. The new manual,
                     DSM-IV, perpetuates the Kraepelinian framework established byDSM-III. Disorders are generally represented as monothetic categories, each one bounded by a distinctive list of criterial features. The manual’s most obvious departure from the previous editions is rhetorical and concerns the definition of its eponymic subject, “mental disorders.” InDSM-IIIandDSM-III-R, the term is defined in a way that includes all of the factions and orientations that were then represented in the American Psychiatric Association:<br>

  Abstract: This book is proposed as a meditation on Michel Foucault’s claim that “equipment is the medium of transformation of logos into ethos.” A good deal of work is required, however, to grasp what such a claim might mean. The difficulty in part lies in the fact that the terms “equipment” and “meditation” are used in a distinctive technical sense. Furthermore, why one would want to transform “logos” into “ethos” equally requires explanation. Hence the reader is alerted that reading this book will require a certain patience. Additionally, and unexpectedly, the book addresses the reader as a friend. Initially this appellation<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fruit-Counterfactuals and International Relations<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lebow Richard Ned<br>
  Abstract: Could World War I have been averted if Franz Ferdinand and his wife hadn't been murdered by Serbian nationalists in 1914? What if Ronald Reagan had been killed by Hinckley's bullet? Would the Cold War have ended as it did? In
      Forbidden Fruit, Richard Ned Lebow develops protocols for conducting robust counterfactual thought experiments and uses them to probe the causes and contingency of transformative international developments like World War I and the end of the Cold War. He uses experiments, surveys, and a short story to explore why policymakers, historians, and international relations scholars are so resistant to the contingency and indeterminism inherent in open-ended, nonlinear systems. Most controversially, Lebow argues that the difference between counterfactual and so-called factual arguments is misleading, as both can be evidence-rich and logically persuasive. A must-read for social scientists,Forbidden Fruitalso examines the binary between fact and fiction and the use of counterfactuals in fictional works like Philip Roth'sThe Plot Against Americato understand complex causation and its implications for who we are and what we think makes the social world work.<br>

They are readily inspired by disconfirmed expectations and failed actions and the regrets they evoke.³ In these circumstances, counterfactual scenarios can empower us by making us believe that we could have brought about better outcomes.⁴ When people invent counterfactuals for any of these<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 5 revealed a strong correlation between worldviews and openness to contingency. Across diverse contexts, the more credence foreign policy experts, historians and international relations scholars place in the ability of laws and generalizations to describe the social world, the stronger their cognitive-stylistic preference for explanatory closure. In making judgments about contingency, they are more likely to be guided by what they believe to be valid laws and generalizations than information provided to them on a case-by-case basis. Experts with a preference for lawlike understandings of history tend to resist counterfactuals that “undo” events or outcomes on which their preferred<br>

Although civil society in the past largely coincided with the boundaries of the state, it is now being reconstructed internationally in ways that strain the capacity of any government to order, guide, or control.

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Autobiography and the Structures of Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t2zt">Touching the World</a><br>
  Abstract: IN THE PRECEDING chapters I have been investigating various dimensions of the world of fact to which autobiographies characteristically refer: biographical (chapter 2), social and cultural (chapter 3), and historical (chapter 4). At the same time, following the paradox intrinsic to the very nature of autobiographical discourse, I have had occasion to emphasize the fictive dimension of autobiography, especially in my analyses of William Maxwell in chapter 1 and Patricia Hampl in chapter 4. There I presented the making of metaphor as a response to the otherwise unacceptable testimony of the facts of experience: the death of the mother, the<br>

  Abstract: In his monumental history of India (1817), British philosopher James Mill devotes more than two-thirds of the preface to refuting the charge that a man who has never visited the subcontinent or learned its languages is unsuited to the task of writing Indian history. Mill insists that what some might regard as parochialism is in fact a virtue, for his critical faculties and judiciousness require insulation from the ʺpartial impressionsʺ and distortions characteristic of firsthand sense perception.

  Abstract: Border talk is everywhere—literal and figural, material and symbolic. The “cartographies of silence” pioneered by feminists like Adrienne Rich in the 1970s have morphed into the spatial practices of third wave feminism as national boundaries and personal borders become ever more permeable in the face of rapidly changing cultural terrains and global landscapes. Borders have a way of insisting on separation at the same time as they acknowledge connection. Like bridges. Bridges signify the possibility of passing over. They also mark the fact of separation and the distance that has to be crossed. Borders between individuals, genders, groups, and<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: The last twenty years have seen very significant changes in the pattern of economic activity around the world, including major increases in the manufacturing capacity of various countries in Asia. In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union initiated a process of political restructuring in Europe which has not perhaps yet reached its final stage. For citizens of the European Union it might seem timely to think again about what attitudes we wish to adopt toward some of the new political constellations that seem to be emerging in the world.

  Abstract: The collecting and exhibiting of natural objects and of artifacts has a long history. There are different kinds of collections, and they have varying origins, and serve a wide variety of different human purposes. Thus, for instance, in the ancient world temples sometimes served as repositories of various offerings, some of which were durable objects, such as the bloody armor of successively defeated opponents. The reasons the victors had for depositing these trophies are probably very complicated; the desire to thank a divine patron and commemorate a signal success may have played an important role, but also perhaps the desire<br>

  Abstract: Jane addams’s decision to become a volunteer also forced her to become an advocate of social justice. The girl from rural Illinois moved to Chicago with the hope of helping disadvantaged individuals. She quickly discovered that caring for individuals could go only so far. To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government. With the help of labor unions and social-reform organizations, she was able to institute juvenile-court laws, the first “mother’s pension” law, tenement-house regulations, an eight-hour workday law for women, factory-inspection laws, and workers’ compensation.<br>

  Author(s) MCLARTY COLIN<br>
  Abstract: It is a fact and no myth at all that one small puzzling proof by David Hilbert in 1888 became the paradigm of modern axiomatic mathematics. Hilbert knew it was that important. He wrote a series of papers on applications and, as we now know, vastly underestimated them: a preliminary series of three went to the
                  Göttinger Nachrichtenand a longer, polished version went to the maximally prestigiousMathematische Annalen. He consciously made it his emblem as he became “the Director General” of twentieth-century mathematics, in the very practical image offered by his friend Hermann Minkowski (1973, 130). With time,<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a world without narrative: In our individual lives as well as in the history of humankind, narratives and storytelling are omnipresent. None of the other modes of symbolic communication “feels” as innately human as the synthetic sequencing of causally related events along a time line. In fact, as the French literary theorist and philosopher Paul Ricoeur argued in his seminal three-volume

Like all new collectivities, Quebec had to ensure its survival and development on a continent yet to be discovered and tamed, alongside long established inhabitants, Aboriginal peoples with whom it invariably had to reckon. As elsewhere, the formation and transformations of the new collectivity occurred in a context of colonial dependency. In fact, in Quebec’s case, at least four types of dependency appeared simultaneously or successively between the seventeenth and the mid-twentieth centuries: political (France, Great Britain), religious (France, the Vatican),<br>

  Abstract: This essay in comparative history has led me to consider the collective imaginary as a social fact, the transformations of which are directly or indirectly linked to other social facts. In turn, the study of these changes themselves not only discloses the logic of discourse but also the social dynamic to which it belongs and of which it is an important driving force. In this sense, the cultural and social are two sides of a common history. I have chosen to give priority to the first because of the question that served as my point of departure: self-representations are constituted<br>

  Abstract: The
                  Origin of Specieswas the culmination of Darwin’s theorizing of the previous twenty years. Its unique role in delineating the subsequent debates over all aspects of evolution account for the enduring interest in the construction of theOriginand the intellectual and other factors that helped shape its final form. We know from Darwin’s correspondence that he saw himself as constantly engaged in “species-work” during the period from 1840 to 1854. It was “far-distant work” but he did indicate to several of his correspondents that he intended to write a book on the species question, though he would “not<br>

  Author(s) Kohn David<br>
  Abstract: However strongly we may see scientific ideas as socially and culturally contingent in their origin and expression, we must acknowledge that they are also the products of individuals. Hence even if we all consider scientific activity to be the reworking of prior scientific activity, the dynamics by which individual scientists develop their theories is a subject integral to the history of science. If we accept the proposition that knowledge grows by public and critical dialogue, we should not ignore the fact that important phases of the dialogue may occur within an individual. Such is the case for Charles Darwin, who<br>

  Abstract: It is a fact familiar to all historians of science that Darwin was extremely slow to put his most important ideas into print. Having become a convinced transmutationist in 1837, he made such rapid progress over the next few years that he soon foresaw the prospect of writing a work that would revolutionize natural history. Yet it was not until 1844 that he produced an essay that was suitable for publication by his family in the event of his death; and fourteen years later, the unexpected arrival of Wallace’s short paper “On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from<br>

  Abstract: This note is a brief comment on Herbert’s interpretation of Darwin’s first chosen field of serious scientific research, the field in which he first earned respect as a highly competent “gentleman of science”. Herbert takes as her text a published comment of mine about what I termed the “dominant cognitive goal” of geologists at the period when Darwin joined their company (1979, pp. 10–11). I want to explain why this did not in fact imply a “narrow definition” of geology, and why there is therefore no paradox in identifying Darwin (and of course his older mentor Lyell) as central<br>

  Abstract: It strikes me that there should be little need for this paper. Only positivists believe that scientific facts and theories are separate from human meanings and values, and even they, inconsistently, set out to extrapolate human and social conclusions from putatively decontextualized facts. Only religious fundamentalists believe that a belief in God cannot be reconciled with science, and that true religion is based on the literal truth of Scripture. This is a sort of religious positivism, as is the notion of creation science, which the ultra-right is currently deploying in opposition to a vulnerable, neo-Darwinian scientific orthodoxy, as part of<br>

  Abstract: In recent controversies on evolution one frequently finds references to “Darwin’s theory of evolution”, as though it were a unitary entity. In reality Darwin’s “theory” of evolution was a whole bundle of theories, and it is impossible to discuss Darwin’s evolutionary thought constructively if one does not distinguish the various components of which it consists. But quite aside from the fact that it helps understanding of the structure of evolutionary theory, to carry the analysis to the level of the subtheories Darwin adopted, it is important to call attention to the composite nature of the Darwinian theory for three very<br>

It is also said that modern philosophy began with Kant’s critique of traditional metaphysics and his critical amalgam of empirical and rationalistic factors in his epistemology as a “prolegomenon to any future metaphysics.” We have seen that, in any event, it was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that conceptual specification of aesthetics and of religion emerged, as an aspect of the new critical philosophy and the enlarged senses of history and culture engendered by the Enlightenment<br>

  Abstract: Archilochos is the first lyric poet whose transmission to us benefited from the literate revolution. Although evidence for the chronology of both poet and alphabet is uncertain, it is most plausible that, educated in the oral tradition, he encountered the new technology of writing at some point in his career and adapted himself to it.

  Abstract: Imagination is the core of desire. It acts at the core of metaphor. It is essential to the activity of reading and writing. In the archaic lyric poetry of Greece, these three trajectories intersected, perhaps fortuitously, and imagination transcribed on human desire an outline more beautiful (some people think) than any before or since. We have seen what shape that outline took. Writing about desire, the archaic poets made triangles with their words. Or, to put it less sharply, they represent situations that ought to involve two factors (lover, beloved) in terms of three (lover, beloved and the space between<br>

The facts are that eros changes you so drastically you seem to become a different person. In conventional thinking, such changes are best categorized as madness. What is the best thing to do with a mad person? Write him out of your novel, is Lysias’ answer. It is an answer that would make some sense to his contemporaries, for his version of eros proceeds from thoroughly conventional premises. It conceives of<br>

  Abstract: It is not easy to summarize the twenty-five years of Spanish decentralization, because it was an exercise of great political and legal complexity that included several factors and many nuances. It is therefore a very difficult subject to deal with in a satisfying manner within the framework of a conference, where this chapter originated. Moreover, every assessment is always tainted by some subjectivity that is inevitably dependent on preconceived political ideas, as well as inescapable cultural sensibilities. Finally, the time when a study is conducted can influence the evaluation of a historical period, which is the case today, since Spain<br>

In this paper, therefore, I want to explain how Dinesen illustrates the reading of British Victorian literature and vice versa.

  Book Title: History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Twelfth-century writers assimilated and transformed a tradition of the conceptual unity of all the arts and attributed that unity to the fact that art both conceals and discloses. Recovering that tradition, especially the methods and motives of concealment, provides extraordinary insights into twelfth-century ideas about the kingdom of God, the status of women, and the nature of time itself. It also identifies a strain in European thought that had striking affinities to methods of perception familiar in Oriental religions and that proved to be antithetic to later humanist traditions in the West.<br>

  Abstract: Teaching and research in the humanities are shaped by various factors, not all of which are immediately evident either to the public or to humanities scholars themselves. This essay examines the role of some of those silently acting but nonetheless effective agents in remaking the world of higher education. The focus will be on the intersection of two major structural trends: the ever-progressing democratization of higher education and the less certain but nonetheless potentially momentous decline in the status of the humanities. How are these trends connected to each other? More generally, what are the likely consequences of demographic changes<br>

I shall discuss the various strategies of narrative and persuasion by which the novel achieves a certain dandylike countenance of impassiveness and superiority. I do not believe that Musil consciously set about constructing fortifications around his work in order to defend against scandal, yet it is as ifYoung Törlesshad in fact been constructed that way.

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Friedman Barton R.<br>
  Abstract: At the same time, this work explores questions about narrative strategies, as they are shaped by, or shape, events. Narratives incorporate the ideological and metaphysical preconceptions that the authors bring with them to their writing. "This is not to argue," Professor Friedman says, "that historical narratives are only about the mind manufacturing them or, more narrowly yet, about themselves as mere linguistic constructs. They illumine both the time and place they seek to re-create and, if by indirection, the time and place of the mind thinking them into being."<br>

  Abstract: Most readers naturally assume that all autobiographies are based on the verifiable facts of a life history, and it is this referential dimension, imperfectly understood, that has checked the development of a poetics of autobiography. Historians and social scientists attempt to isolate the factual content of autobiography from its narrative matrix, while literary critics, seeking to promote the appreciation of autobiography as an imaginative art, have been willing to treat such texts as though they were indistinguishable from novels. Autobiographers themselves, of course, are responsible for the problematical reception of their work, for they perform willy-nilly both as artists and<br>

  Abstract: Reading James Frazer’s

Frazer has been made the subject of anthropological “contempt and ridicule . . . abhorrence and denunciation”—his own estimate of the only acknowledgment that a “savage forefather” is likely to get from a modern (Frazer [1922], 307). This intention is further accommodated by the opening of the work itself, which is characterized, first, by particularly “fine” writing—a sudden access ofstyle;second, by the display of a work of fine<br>

His thesis is that ongoing fragmentations of knowledge are not reflections of the real world but “artifacts of scholarship.”<br>

  Abstract: The experiential process may well appear future-oriented insofar as it remains recalcitrant to seamless integration within prior expectations and insofar as it perturbs routinized perceptions, actions, and attitudes. Yet it also involves the
                  retrospective revision, and not the outright dismissal, of the earlier orientations it disrupts. Experience harbours two temporal maneuvers: an initial disruption of the given is followed by a retrospective revision of the past so as to accommodate the new and reestablish continuity. At hand in dialectical experience is what can be called – what has in fact already been called by Kristeva, Heidegger, Luhmann, and others –<br>

  Book Title: In Search of Elegance-Towards an Architecture of Satisfaction<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Beauprè-Lincourt Louise<br>
  Abstract: Michel Lincourt calls for a dignified architecture, centred around the concept of elegance, that will provide satisfaction to both its users and the surrounding society. Elegance, defined as the symbiosis of excellence and magnificence, is the ultimate attribute of any creative endeavour and achieving it is the architect's prime motivation. Using this concept, Lincourt develops a set of archetypes for designing a more satisfactory architecture and provides an in-depth analysis of three examples of architectural elegance: the Palais-Royal and the Fondation Rothchild Workers' Residence in Paris and the Municipality of Outremont in Montreal.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt8002k">In Search of Elegance</a><br>
  Abstract: The journey towards an enlarged awareness of the architectural phenomenon necessitates the conducting of two successive epochès. The first suspends all existing theoretical knowledge in order to uncover the architectural phenomenon as it presents itself to our consciousness. The second probes the architectural phenomenon through the removal of the successive veils that drape its factual reality, uncovering its eidos.<br>

  Abstract: The preceding epochès and constitution were attempts to grasp the essence of architecture. Using three examples, we explored the symbiotic idea of high quality and great beauty as the necessary conditions for producing an architecture of satisfaction. But our inquiry is not yet finished. We have not taken the final step of the epochès. This step might involve a fuller formulation of the essence of architecture and lead to a respectful, successful design. And we have developed only one constitution; more are required.<br>

  Section 3  Return to Opacity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80283">Distant Relation</a><br>
  Abstract: Carpentier discovers that writing, in fact, distills the authorial voice through the duplication and multiplication of voices opened by the repetition of texts that have preceded the author’s own. In this way, no text (indeed, no system of signification) can purport to be the one unique text, the text that could, through its own unity, lead us towards a unified totality. The notion of a unified literary tradition in which a singular voice could take on the value of the whole is therefore constantly dissolved in the multiplicity of voices that tradition is constituted by.

  Author(s) Boundas Constantin V.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche’s influence upon deconstruction has been well-documented.¹ Yet, what has been left relatively unexamined, is the fact that his impact has often been responsible for the internal differentiation of the deconstructive paradigm into discordant theories and practices. We know of course that between the dominant, Derrida-inspired deconstruction and the “minoritarian deconstruction,”² led by G. Deleuze, F. Guattari, F. Laruelle, T. Negri and N. Bolz, there exist antagonistic and mutually displacing tendencies. But not much attention has been paid to the fact that these tendencies, at least in part, are motivated by different inscriptions of the “Nietzsche-effect” upon deconstructive palimpsests. Based<br>

  Abstract: In the immense secondary literature on Nietzsche relatively little attention seems to have been paid to the influence of kynic motives and ideas on both the form and substance of his philosophy.

A close examination of the main philosophical project of Nietzsche, the transvaluation of values, moreover, reveals his kinship with the intention of Kynism to<br>

In a work which is replete with exaggeration couched in poetic, figurative, and metaphoric language, one fact might easily be overlooked. Nietzsche is making this claim literally and takes this claim very seriously: “Body am I entirely.” Within the context ofZarathustra, a book which is addressed to “all or no one,” Nietzsche attempts to persuade those few who are capable of actualizing<br>

  On Being “the Last Kantian in Nazi Germany”: from:

  Author(s) CLARK DAVID L.<br>
  Abstract: “The last Kantian in Nazi Germany”: this is how Emmanuel Levinas (1990b, 153) describes “Bobby,” the dog who befriends him during his “long captivity” in a slave-labour camp. Thirty years after the fact, Levinas briefly tells the story of his terrible days in Camp 1492, days whose numbing inhumanity is momentarily relieved by the arrival of an animal that offers a semblance of respect. I say “semblance” because Levinas’s experience of Bobby is informed by conventional assumptions about animality that make it impossible for him straightforwardly to attribute dutifulness to a creature that is not human.

  Abstract: During the second half of 1941 the École Nationale des Cadres d’Uriage was, for its admirers, the flagship of the National Revolution, the first school in the land, the training centre of France’s new elites. But was Uriage during its heyday in fact the truly national institution its title implied? Who was studying and teaching there? What was their daily life, and their real relationship with the Vichy government? What was the actual agenda of Dunoyer de Segonzac and his staff — for example, with regard to Vichy’s youth movements, or toward modern women? How should history judge the Uriage experience?<br>

The École Nationale des Cadres d’Uriage was dominated by devout and idealistic Catholics whom the “realists” around Admiral Darlan considered naive (patronizingly referring to them as “sacristy fleas”), while the hard-line proto-fascists at Vichy like Gaston Bergery or Pierre Pucheu made more and more disparaging remarks about “scoutish and churchy (

  Abstract: The grandiose triumphalism of the Grande Fête at Uriage in the summer of 1942 masked the fact that the school, by that time, had serious difficulties with the government, fuelled by powerful rivals and critics. One sign of trouble had been the successful pressure exerted on the school the previous summer, apparently by Henri Massis, to do without the Abbé de Naurois and Emmanuel Mounier; another was the fact that Mounier was abruptly incarcerated in early 1942 on suspicion of Resistance activities. The government’s concern over the youth movements led to a summons to Vichy of their leaders, including Segonzac,<br>

  Author(s) Verdon John<br>
  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition? It is the translation of the biological into social/cultural experience that is the heart of an epistemology of gender. An elaboration of the<br>

  8  ANDROGYNOUS REALISM IN HEINRICH VON KLEIST’S “DIE HEILIGE CÄCILIE ODER DIE GEWALT DER MUSIK (EINE LEGENDE)” from:

  Author(s) Bohm Arnd<br>
  Abstract: Relatively neglected by critics in comparison to others of his works, Kleist’s story with the elaborate tripartite title, which can be approximately translated into English as “Saint Cecilia, or the Power of Music (A Legend),” has begun to attract increasing attention. To some extent, this is due to the fact that the other works have been examined and reexamined with such exhausting intensity that a turn to lesser-known texts is inevitable. But it is also the case that, among Kleist’s puzzling prose, this story stands out for its strangeness. What is it about? What is its “message”? In this case,<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Maurice Schumann: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80x6j">Political Ecumenism</a><br>
  Abstract: Of all those who transmitted the Free French message of defiance, resistance, and hope to those living in Vichy France or in the German-occupied zone, none was more eloquent than the journalist-turned-broadcaster Maurice Schumann. Schumann was born in Paris on 10 April 1911 to upper-middle-class Jewish parents who were so thoroughly assimilated that they felt only the most nominal link to their ancestral faith.¹ Schumann
                  pèrewas a successful corset manufacturer; like his wife, he was devoted to the Republic and to the memory of the Revolution which had given it birth. Patriotism came naturally in this environment: Schumann tells<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: If cosmology, as a product of human activity, pretends to deal with the universe in its totality, assuming this totality in the natural attitude of mind as omni-spatiality and omni-temporality, it must exercise bravery in combination with a healthy skepticism in making pronouncements about the whole, by being only a tiny part of this whole. In spite of the fact that the philosophical mind, that is, a critical mind, accounts for its own incomprehensibility of this totality on the grounds of the finitude of humanity, this finitude is at the same time counterweighted by its alleged infinitude. For example, Kant,<br>

  3  Constituting the Universe from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0sq9">The Sense of the Universe</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we analyze the general epistemological conditions for knowability and explicability of the universe as a whole. Both knowability and explicability imply an anthropological dimension in cosmology, for both these requirements have human origin: to speculate about the universe one must experience its presence through the instantaneous synthesis associated with conscious life. It is argued that the cosmological principle acts as reduction of this synthesis to a mental spatial uniformity of the universe. However, the contingent facticity of the cosmological principle leads to the necessity of its explication in terms of generative steps required to grasp the sense<br>

  Abstract: It is a matter of common understanding nowadays that with all respect to the grandiose achievements of modern science and cosmology in particular, scientific discourse in general, being efficient in interpreting the most nonhuman aspects of reality, feels helpless in advancing the understanding of the mystery of human persons who are those agencies that make the universe palpable and act as its voice. This hidden predicament lies in the fact that cosmology is being constructed from within the

  2  Pagan Oratory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t0m">Augustine's Theology of Preaching</a><br>
  Abstract: Augustine holds a foundational place in the development of the Christian sermon. This is partly due to the fact that he began life as a professional teacher of rhetoric. His conversion led to him being changed from a professor of rhetoric into a Christian preacher. His unique experiences put him in the position of being able to offer self-conscious reflection upon the nature of preaching and its relationship to oration. The fruit of this is seen in
                     De Doctrina Christiana, which will be considered in a subsequent chapter.<br>

  Author(s) Perkins Miriam Y.<br>
  Abstract: Meaningful understanding, often called “interpretation” in academic contexts, is vital throughout seminary education. Interpretation is deliberative exploration and creative expression of fruitful encounter. It is essential to understanding scripture texts, historical sources and artifacts, theological writers across time, and real-time conversations about ethical, spiritual, and pastoral matters. The finding and sharing of insight involved in interpretation is always shaped by encounters between ourselves and what we read, ourselves and other people, and our own life experiences and the presence of God.<br>

  Abstract: The most important challenge when interpreting any parable is recognizing its function: How is it intended to convince its audience? Only thus can its meaning or message can be accurately perceived. Together with the story line, contextual factors such as the speaker, the audience, and the exigency determine the function of a parable. The argumentative structure is just as important. This chapter presents a comprehensive unplugged analysis of every Lukan parable told by Jesus, focusing on these issues.<br>

Recent allusions to history as the ‘new gardening’ by a BBC representative¹ or its characterization as the ‘new cooking’ by historian Justin Champion (2008a) suggest that in Britain history-related television programmes are on their way to outdoing the highly successful gardening or cooking formats in terms of popularity.

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

  Abstract: In endeavoring to explain the fact that the Durkheimian religion cluster primarily wrote about primitive societies while other important members of the Durkheimian team, e.g., Maurice Halbwachs and François Simiand, concentrated on Western society, W. Paul Vogt argues that the religion cluster studied primitives in part because they had an attitude of “despair” regarding the modern world. They perceived something troubling about the contemporary situation in the West and attempted to use primitive societies as a means for pointing to what had been lost in the move to modernity (Vogt 1976: 43). According to this account, the religion cluster believed<br>

The goal there was to respond to a pressing question: why this near total abandonment of an intellectual and political position that was one of the more powerful and promising ones during the middle Third Republic? Although Terry Clark’s (1973) claim for a general shift in temperament in the Latin Quarter from cartesianism to spontaneism is less an explanation than a description of the effects of some other causal factors, it seems indisputable that a<br>

  11  Being a Poststructuralist Intellectual from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcrr1">Godless Intellectuals?</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the central ideas that emerged from the discussion of the development of the personal identities of the Durkheimians (in Chapter 7) has to do with what might be called their minoritarian
                  habitus. The Jewishness of Durkheim, Mauss, and Hertz is the most obvious element here. A related fact had to do with the manner in which the mystic Durkheimians Hertz and Mauss pursued a particular kind of transfigured political project that was fundamentally tied to their minoritarian identities. In this chapter, I will explore the ways in which the poststructuralist group is similarly operating from minoritarian positions, if<br>

  Abstract: At the conclusion of
                  Formes élémentaires, Durkheim posed a question: What shape will religion take in the future, as secularization, already well underway in his time, continues its expansion? I have argued that he was posing this question for the intellectuals as much as for everyone else, and that the echoes of that fact resounded in some ways that have not been fully understood. Mystic Durkheimianism, in its incarnations among the youngAnnéemembers, in the Collège de Sociologie, or in some varieties of the poststructuralism that emerged in France in the 1960s, constitutes a fascinatingly nuanced intellectual response to<br>

  Author(s) Pfeil Gretchen<br>
  Abstract: Attempts to discuss the central ritual forms of American Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity, among them conversion narrative and sermon, are troubled by a seeming conflict. They seem to be ritual forms, and at the same time, to be something more, even opposed to ritual action. The urgency and personal quality of these forms of devotional practice lead, sometimes, to readings of them as transparent statements of fact. Conversion narrative, for example, is both clearly a form of devotional practice and also “real,” compelling as autobiography and a source of information about practitioners’ lives. This chapter unpacks this paradoxical quality to<br>

At the outset, the main line of production consisted of custom, handmade, luxurious (luksuzni) pieces of carved wood that required lengthy manufacturing time and cost a significant amount of money.

  Abstract: It need not be stressed that, in film-historical terms, the road movie is predominantly a man’s genre. It also goes without saying that, because of this fact, the genre has come in for its fair share of criticism. Much of the discourse around the road genre that focuses on its notionally unreconstructed masculinity (and which gives rise to the generic inversions we witness in a number of road movies) can be seen as part of a wider questioning of the dominant fiction of patriarchy, and therefore also of mainstream cinematic narrative; the two of which come together as a target<br>

  Abstract: If what we understand by ‘transnational cinema’ is to a large extent still a definition in progress, the connection between mobility and travel within the terms of the transnational has assumed critical currency. To suggest that this is a necessary connection is really to beg the question, in fact, of what transnational means, and more specifically what is at stake in the process of naming it. This is an important task, given that the recent topicality of transnational cinema, as far as its academic study is concerned, is based less on its status as a cinematic trend, than on the<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book has been to historicize and understand French cinema’s exploration of the road movie. As I suggested in my introduction, this is not a straightforward task. As the road movie is dif-fi cult to identify in culturally specific terms, and is therefore always a genre in search of its identity, a French road movie is engaged in a constant negotiation of its own physical and conceptual boundaries. In fact, as I hope to have shown, analysing the ‘French road movie’ ultimately begs the question of its ‘French-ness’. If the road movie, to an extent, resists being<br>

Clearly, there are as many ways of experiencing history as there are histories to experience’.¹ Such an experience and understanding of history, however, was never a part of my growing up; history books meant an immersion in drudgery, a laborious saunter down a thick slush of facts and a wrestle with the imminent prospect of comeuppance in the event of forgetting some details while writing tests.

  Abstract: Rhetoric has its own definitions for terms, not to say concepts, that often crop up, as if by themselves, in other disciplines. In fact, one of the enduring features of rhetoric is, as Aristotle would have it, that it is a “technique” that cannot aspire to be a science because it does not have an object of its own. Rhetoric is by essence latitudinarian and the price to be paid is that of being pillaged by the human sciences, which own their objects, or believe that they do. Rhetoric has many Others.

In fact, one of the enduring features of rhetoric is, as Aristotle would have it, that it is a “technique” that cannot aspire to be a science because it does not have an object of its own. Rhetoric is by essence latitudinarian and the price to be paid is that of being pillaged by the human sciences, which own their objects, or believe that they do. Rhetoric has many Others. It is a way to preserve what has<br>

  Abstract: The coming together of Europe has multiplied both opportunities and constraints for societal actors from the new member states to pursue their interests within the multi-level settings of the European Union (EU). On the one hand, European integration has been seen as an essential factor affecting the structures, strategies, and visibility of these actors by opening new opportunity structures and providing supplementary access points that can be used in complementary ways to the pre-existing national ones. At the same time, however, this process is also creating new constraints for participation and collective mobilization and is seen to favor some societal<br>

  Abstract: With few exceptions in academic literature concerning violence in Northern Ireland (Bell 1990; Jenkins 1983; Roche 2008; Roche 2007; Roche 2005a; Roche 2003), young people and their violent interplay have not held much appeal for social scientists. This is so even despite the fact that throughout urban, enclaved, and economically deprived working-class housing areas in Northern Ireland, young people, and particularly young men, are reported as consistently participating in “low-level” violent activities. While no formal definition of this notion of “low-level” violence exists, its use in the Northern Irish context is widespread. Thoughts vary on the origin of the expression<br>

  Abstract: There is hardly any doubt that migration was a major factor that contributed to the reshaping of post-1945 European societies. Labour migration was a central component of the Fordist production system and a cornerstone of the ‘golden’ postwar decades, and migration was one factor that transformed social and demographic structures.¹ Furthermore, migration, flight, and expulsion constituted central experiences in many Europeans’ lives. For others, the denial of the opportunity to migrate across borders may have been a key experience. Nevertheless, in many general national histories migration is still largely neglected.

                  Dukhov den v Toledo(All Souls’ Day in Toledo), was staged apparently only once, on 23 March 1915, at the Moscow Kamerny Theater under the direction of Aleksandr Tairov. The pantomime had in fact been commissioned by Tairov so that the season in which it was performed would have at least one pantomime, given the contemporary interest in nonverbal drama.

  Abstract: Photography and museum studies have recently entered into dialogue, as historians and anthropologists begin to deal with that peculiar class of museum artefacts: the photographic archives. Roughly three types of approach can be distinguished. First there is the approach that sees photographic collections as the basis for historical discourse on a specific social group at a specific point in time, such as Geary’s (1988) work on Bamum. Then there is the line that sets out from the transformation of views about a specific group, constructed through time by several different authors, who may or may not have known about each<br>

  Abstract: In December 1994, the Tiwi Land Council, representing the ‘Traditional Owners’ of Melville and Bathurst Islands in northern Australia, paid a considerable amount of money for an old spear and club at a Sotheby’s auction. The Tiwi artefacts were purchased to be put on display in a local museum on the islands (Tiwi Land Council 1995: 10). The reappropriation of indigenous objects raises the question of how early collectors obtained them, and what they then meant in terms of cross-cultural exchange.<br>

  Abstract: I believe there is an anti-Muslim wind blowing across the European continent. One factor is the perception that Muslims are making politically exceptional, culturally unreasonable or theologically alien demands upon European states. Against that, I wish to say, that the claims Muslims are making, in fact, parallel comparable arguments about gender or ethnic equality. Seeing the issue in that context shows how European and contemporary is the logic of mainstream Muslim identity politics. Additionally I shall argue that multicultural politics must embrace what I call a moderate secularism, and resist a radical secularism.<br>

  Abstract: Behind the

That his verses had disappeared (or –horribile dictu– been cancelled) from Sura 53 ‘The Star’ of theQur’ândoes not take away from the fact that they had been ‘there’. Muhammad was their mental receiver and scribe, unaware of their being inspired by the devil and not, as usual, by Gibreel. Their actual absence only bears witness to their one-time presence. In this way, Iblis has had his negative share in the editing of theQur’ân.<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Manuscripts in Transition-Tradition and Creative Recycling<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): VERBEKE Werner<br>
  Abstract: Manuscripts constitute the source material par excellence for diverse academic disciplines. Art historians, philologists, historians, theologians, philosophers, book historians and even jurists encounter one another around the codex. The fact that such an encounter can be extremely fertile was demonstrated, during an international congress in Brussels on November 5-9, 2002. A record of the discussions can be found in this volume of the Mediaevalia Lovaniensia. The editors selected those lectures that focused on the historical, literary-historical, philosophical and theological aspects of the congress theme as opposed to those with an explicit art-historical perspective. The common thread, however, is always the codicological aspect: what can the study of manuscripts contribute to the literary-historical interpretation or the insight into the functioning of a text in its original context. The various contributions testify to a fearless and unrestrained interdisciplinary approach to the material. The subjects broached cover a broad domain: from the development of classical themes to the transmission of lyrical models, from visual material giving evidence of the reception of literary texts to the artes-literature used as a vehicle for a love story.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdxv4">Medieval Manuscripts in Transition</a><br>
  Author(s) ARBUTHNOT Sharon<br>
  Abstract: ‘Compilation’ is a largely self-explanatory term. Used of a medieval literary activity, it refers to a recycling process whereby extracts culled from a variety of manuscript sources are cobbled together to create new texts. In a crude, although convenient, analogy, one might suggest that compiling is the textual equivalent of creating a mosaic – the fragments originally belong to very different contexts, a certain amount of compiler-provided ‘grout’ holds the entirety together, and the end product is a quite distinct artefact in itself. In the twelfth and thirteen centuries, learned Irishmen expended a great deal of energy in this direction,<br>

  Abstract: Books make great gifts. In fact, a book is always a double gift: an object, and a text. These days such a gift is a relatively straightforward affair, in the sense that there are plenty of books on offer, which is evidently not to say that giving a book is always a cheap option. Beautifully bound volumes printed on high-quality paper can cost an arm and a leg, not to mention the time and brainspace that has to be invested in selecting a book whose worth the recipient will be able to properly appreciate.<br>

  The Ultimate Causes of Paranoia: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdz7w">Origins and Ends of the Mind</a><br>
  Author(s) de Block Andreas<br>
  Abstract: Griesinger and Kraepelin qualified paranoia as one of the three major psychotic disorders, together with schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis (Griesinger 1845, Kraepelin 1915). In psychoanalytic thinking, paranoia even became the paradigmatic form of psychosis. Freud’s only case-studies of psychotic patients, for instance, were devoted to paranoid individuals (Freud 1911, Freud 1915). Jacques Lacan (1988), and to a lesser degree Melanie Klein (1946), pursued this line of thinking by considering paranoia as the essence of the psychotic process (Roudinesco & Plon 1997). Contemporary psychiatric nosography, however, handles schizophrenia as the central taxon. In fact, schizophrenia has become a more or less generic<br>

  Abstract: The use of digital technologies in the reproduction of texts has profoundly transformed attitudes toward books and also the production and format of books themselves. Remarkably, at a time when it is often suggested that digital books may soon supersede conventional books, there has been a lot of rethinking about what a book is, as both object and artifact (Boutcher 2012, 59). In addition it is often assumed that digital technologies will lead inexorably to a universalization and standardization that will override cultural differences and local identities. The way in which digital technologies are used in relation to books appears,<br>

In doing so, they emphasize that new media are interesting and important inasmuch as they combine three main elements: artifacts or devices, practices, and the arrangements and social forms built around practices. “Today, a lively and contentious cycle of capture, cooptation and subversion of information, content, personal interaction, and system architecture characterizes the relationship between the institutionalized, mainstream center and the increasingly interactive, participatory and expanding edges of media culture” (Lievrouw 2011, 2).<br>

  Abstract: The sources responsible for the expansion and transformation of the law and economics movement of the 1970s and 1980s have never been adequately explained. One fact remains clear: this movement coincided with the rise of interdisciplinary legal studies and the growing disenchantment with the legal process and fundamental rights schools. In the midst of the disintegration of and disillusionment with mainstream jurisprudence, legal scholars looked outside law to economics for law’s missing authority and the autonomy of legal discourse. Of all the social sciences, economics was the most promising candidate offering “right answers” for law’s problems.<br>

In the field of child protection, as indeed in other areas of welfare, the roots of current policies are to be found in those of previous New Labour administrations, but the trends predate them.

  Author(s) Segovia Fernando F.<br>
  Abstract: Latino/a biblical criticism has from the beginning raised the question of critical task: the identity and role of the critic. This problematic it has pursued in recurrent fashion through the years, with greater intensity in recent times. Such focalization may be viewed as the result of various intersecting factors, social as well as cultural: the striking rise in population numbers within the country; the widening presence of points of origin from Latin America and the Caribbean; and the growing sophistication in matters of method and theory within the field of studies. With exploding demographics, multiplying backgrounds, and expanding discourses, the<br>

  6  The Illusion of Depth of Understanding in Science from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh59s">Scientific Understanding</a><br>
  Author(s) YLIKOSKI PETRI<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers of science have a long tradition of making a connection between explanation and understanding, but only lately have they started to give the latter notion a substantial role in their theories. The reason is because understanding is an even more difficult notion than explanation. To my mind, the recent interest in understanding (exemplified by this volume), springs from the fact that explanation is a cognitive activity, and for too long theories of explanation have dismissed the cognitive dimension with the weak excuse of its being a too “subjective” ingredient for a theory of
                  scientificexplanation. Explanation is connected with<br>

  Book Title: Liberalism at Its Limits-Crime and Terror in the Latin American Cultural Text<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): RODRÍGUEZ ILEANA<br>
  Abstract: In
      Liberalism at Its Limits,Ileana Rodríguez considers several Latin American nations that govern under the name of liberalism yet display a shocking range of nondemocratic features. In her political, cultural, and philosophical analysis, she examines these environments in which liberalism seems to have reached its limits, as the universalizing project gives way to rampant nonstate violence, gross inequality, and neocolonialism.Focusing on Guatemala, Colombia, and Mexico, Rodríguez shows how standard liberal models fail to account for new forms of violence and exploitation, which in fact follow from specific clashes between liberal ideology and local practice. Looking at these tensions within the ostensibly well-ordered state, Rodríguez exposes how the misunderstanding and misuse of liberal principles are behind realities of political turmoil, and questions whether liberalism is in fact an ideology sufficient to empower populations and transition nation-states into democratic roles in the global order.In this way,Liberalism at Its Limitsoffers a critical examination of the forced fitting of liberal models to Latin American nations and reasserts cross-cultural communication as crucial to grasping the true link between varying systems of value and politics.<br>

However, it is clear from international events in the early years of the twenty-first century that concepts of nation and national identity merit careful examination and are still a motivating force engendering significant repercussions.

  Abstract: Using indigenous myth within a work of fiction is an established postcolonial strategy of resistance. The fact that Humphreys made a practice of using classical myth in a variety of narrative techniques in his fiction before he began to use Celtic myths predominantly does not prevent his use of indigenous myth being considered as a deliberately anti-imperial strategy. ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence is perhaps the best, certainly the most complex, example of his use of a variety of tales from
                  The Mabinogion, although the Blodeuwedd archetype has occurred in his fiction throughout his career.² Humphreys has written extensively<br>

While his official biographies note that he studied with Howard Trafton and Gyorgy Kepes (the latter a superstar designer in his own right), the fact was that Bass’s “studies” were limited to a handful of night-school courses. Bass was always very modest on this point, reminding interviewers that there were few opportunities to study graphic design in America at that time because “commercial art” was considered a lowly profession.¹ Though it is true that<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1950s, the views of Thomas McKeown on the causes of the decline of mortality from pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)¹ in Britain have become well known and vigorously debated.² McKeown’s claim that improved nutrition and standards of living were the principal factor in the halving of mortality from the 1830s to the 1900s continues to exercise medical historians, as well as historical demographers and epidemiologists. One reason for this is the corollary of his argument, namely, that the three other factors he identified – medical intervention, public health measures, and changes in the disease – were relatively minor causes in the overall<br>

In chapter 7 I raised that question, but in the years since then, I have learned more about the subject. The main point that I have found out is simple: the Torah in fact portrays God as androgynous.

  Abstract: This paper discusses the implications for the Rastafari movement, of its spread worldwide in the last two decades. It suggests that further opportunities for Rastafari mobilization, which began in Jamaica in the early 1930s, exist outside the Caribbean, especially in North America and United Kingdom. On the other hand, Rastafari communities abroad have to deal with pressures such as racism, criminalization, and commodification in more intense ways than in the Caribbean. The author argues that all these factors influence the shape that Rastafari takes outside the Caribbean, as well as at its point of origin. It suggests that the impact<br>

  Abstract: LATIN AMERICAN-CANADIAN LITERATURE is currently undergoing rapid development. Practically nonexistent, until the second half of the 1970s except for the presence of certain writers, it is now laying claim to a well-defined space within the “Canadian mosaic.” Symptomatic of this trend is the fact that publishing houses such as Coach House, Wallace, Québec Amérique, and others,¹ are publishing Canadian-Latin American authors in English and French translation. Apart from this activity, there are also publishing efforts in the Latin American ethno-cultural sphere itself, characterized by editorial criteria that vary from publisher to publisher; however, all these publishers give priority to the<br>

Some are heroic, some filled with tragedy, some triumphalist, some angry, some resigned. Every one of them is incomplete, in that the visceral experience of combat, what Tolstoy called ʹthe actual killing,ʹ the smell of it, the taste of it, is irreproduceable.

  Abstract: Although the Italians played a seminal role in the development of the Western civility tradition, it was during the reign of the French absolutist monarchs that civil etiquette became substantially associated with the preservation of privilege. The fact that egalitarian Protestantism was a minority movement in France allowed the French monarchs to adhere to an etiquette philosophy based on a social philosophy of distinction and superiority.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442687660">Civility</a><br>
  Abstract: In Part I we tried to show how France, America, and England developed different civility preferences due to the manner in which each nation was affected by a variety of factors, including political philosophy and system of government, religion, intellectual history, geography, economy, familial norms, and the manner in which emotions were restrained and expressed. By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos. The industrialization of the West did not have a substantial levelling effect over national identity or national ideology.<br>

  9  Towards a Cultural Sociology of Civility from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442687660">Civility</a><br>
  Abstract: The study of the historical background of a culture is vital to one’s understanding of its civility practices as well as its ongoing present. Yet, there are other equally important factors that must be considered. Although they may in some measure be the outcomes of historical and moral forces, these factors need to be studied on their own merit because the manner in which they intersect makes for an ‘anatomy of civility’ that is sociological as well as psychological. In this part of the book we will discuss these various factors and show how a ‘cultural sociology of civility’ needs<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442687660">Civility</a><br>
  Abstract: The study of civility is the study not only of the social history of a culture but of the human need for satisfactory social bonds and the problems that emerge when these bonds become too loose or too tight. When they are too tight, we are left with a collectivism that engulfs the individual, drowning out personal needs and aspirations. When they are too loose, the individual is deprived of the safety of communal norms and abandoned to a wasteland of freedom in which interactions between self and others lack meaning and depth.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442693951">Magical Imaginations</a><br>
  Abstract: Twentieth-century Shakespeare criticism has bequeathed us a picture of
                  The Tempestas a document of early British imperialism.¹ Like the interpretations they serve to contest, postcolonial readings of the play usually view Prospero as an analogue of James or his colonial administrator.² Such readings, though, ignore the historical fact that in his political writings and his legislation James represented magicians as traitors who should be tortured and executed without pardon. In his 1597Daemonologie, and again in his 1603Basilikon Doron, James explicitly proclaimed that in using powers given to them by devils, magicians undermine the divine sovereignty of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: The abstract study of language in the previous chapter takes on a concrete basis through Herder’s study of specific cultural communities. Both are central to his ontological position – that is, to those factors he takes as meaningful in accounting for social life.¹ Herder is now commonly credited as one of the first thinkers in the Western tradition to celebrate cultural diversity. Yet the erroneous idea that he fails to grasp sufficiently the diversity that exists
                  withincultures persists among some political theorists. The first section of this chapter begins the task of correcting this misperception by showing that Herder fully<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442695344">Herder's Political Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: It is hardly surprising, given Herder’s views on the state, that he shows relatively little interest in government and administration. But the fact that Herder’s direct engagement with politics in this narrow sense forms only a small part of his extensive intellectual output has meant that it has often been thought that he ‘was not a political thinker in the true sense of the word.’¹ It should be clear that I reject the narrow conception of politics on which this assessment is based, but due to its pervasiveness and misleading nature it needs to be addressed directly.² Viroli in his<br>

  Author(s) JENSEN PHEBE<br>
  Abstract: In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and<br>

  Abstract: The language of tears seen in poem 92, “Piangete, donne, et con voi pianga Amore” (“O ladies weep, and may Love weep with you”), mourning the death of Cino da Pistoia, establishes the act of weeping not simply as a natural part of grief but as a means of prostrating oneself before God together with the community.¹ To weep openly is to break stoic apathy.

  The co-operative ideal from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1gxxrms">The Vigil of Quebec</a><br>
  Abstract: Elites and planning: at first glance, these two terms suggest an irreconcilable opposition. In fact, planning implies co-ordinating activities and defining long-term projects on a basis of technical criteria. The latter should be more or less imposed on the multiplicity and incoherence of individual wants and goals. The elite, on the contrary, represents an authority delegated spontaneously by groups. The leader is not a ‘good talker’ or even necessarily a ‘learned man,’ but he who proposes a representation of his own milieu and objectives for action in which other men may recognize their own viewpoint and desire for change.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt1h1hq7v">Merleau-Ponty and Marxism</a><br>
  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty’s doubts about classical Marxism were nourished by his integrity and the seriousness of his commitment to humanism. Proletarian internationalism and proletarian spontaneity had ceased to be effective factors in politics, and proletarian control of the means of production was grotesquely distorted by the Stalinist regime. Nevertheless the pressure of events compelled him, not to abandon Marx’s teaching, but to reinterpret it. Sartre was right to note that Merleau-Ponty had returned to his inner life, but his refuge was no more than a strategic retreat. In his lectures at the Collège de France he was undertaking an intellectual overhaul that<br>

  Abstract: For some forty years now and since well before his premature death in an automobile accident in 1960, Albert Camus has been considered one of the most significant and influential writers of this century. Eloquent testimony to this fact is furnished by the several thousands of articles and books that have been devoted to the man and his work in countless countries on all five continents and in languages as diverse as Russian, Arabic, and Japanese.¹ That this status as one of the ‘classics’ of French literature would only be disputed precisely within the boundaries of his native land is<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters, I have spoken of the way the Camusian text functions within itself, produces its own reflection, as well as the way it reproduces within itself its relationship to its reader. It remains to consider the manner in which the different texts relate to one another, for here too a mirroring effect can be seen to be at work. The intertextuality¹ in question is of a very special kind since no texts by other writers are concerned. In fact, if one were to consider the whole of Camus’ works as one single text, then one could more<br>

  Abstract: All the existentialists are united in their opposition to idealist philosophies which ignore space and time as necessary conditions of the human existence. In no way is the finiteness of the human creature more evident than in the fact that he must live an earthly existence, and, since things in time have a beginning and an end, that he must be subject to the mysteries of birth and death. Ignoring these fundamental facts, the idealists sought to transcend the time process by rational system and they imposed a rational pattern upon the course of historical events.

  Abstract: The variety of case studies included here should not give the impression that this volume was conceived as a comprehensive overview of the issue of independent documentary in contemporary times. Rather, it aimed at prompting new interest for, and innovative academic perspectives on, the manifold significations of independent documentary production today.¹ Besides demonstrating the complexity, variability, pragmatism and paradoxes that this notion of ‘independent’ documentary entails, this collection of case studies also endeavoured to reveal important similarities among different practitioners in the field.

  Author(s) Spalding Frances<br>
  Abstract: Behind this playful, exuberant image,¹ celebrating Lady Ottoline Morrell and her court at Garsington, lie complex emotions. At an early age, Dorothy Brett had suffered from hearing problems. It first became noticeable while she was a student at the Slade School of Art, then, as now, part of University College, London. The Provost of this prestigious institution, horrified by the fact that Brett and two friends had chosen to picnic on the hallowed lawn inside the courtyard, delivered a severe reprimand. ‘I’m sorry, I’m deaf,’ Brett replied, ‘I haven’t been able to hear a word you said.’²<br>

  Abstract: People come up with all sorts of ideas. Some even think it might be interesting to make a film director meet another film director. How nice would it be for two people to meet who have such a thing in common! In fact, it would be quite burdensome for a filmmaker. This is because we have nothing to talk about.

  Author(s) Brown Precious<br>
  Abstract: An essential (albeit controversial) point should immediately be made clear: the work of Angelopoulos is not ‘modernist’ in the sense that Anglo-Saxon critics have given to this term to qualify, in art history, a time past, but still belonging to modernity.¹ From end to end, Angelopoulos’ work is, in fact, traversed by history. Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

  Abstract: By unfastening Arab identity from conventional cultural stereotypes, Bedouinism and ancient pre-Islamic Arabian bloodlines, this book sought to reveal the complexities and changing nature of historic Arab identity. The book was intended as an invitation to begin rethinking Arabness afresh, and by highlighting the shortcomings inherent in the static, monolithic manner in which historical Arab communities have often been discussed, our analysis sought to reappraise historic Arabness as an ethnicity, tracking its evolution and contextualising its development with close attention to the sociopolitical and ‘cultural stuff’ factors that sustain ethnogenesis.<br>

  Abstract: One piece of information with which we like to startle our students when teaching film and adaptation theory is that at least half of all films produced worldwide can trace their origin to some literary text. Statistically, one out of two movies we watch is not a “film,” but a “book-to-film adaptation.”¹ Usually, we like to add another piece of information that is equally revealing, namely that quite often successful and popular films are based on mediocre and forgotten novels.

  Abstract: In the last section of Chapter 3 I suggested that Sontag and modernism are two interconnected intellectual objects. From the perspective of her visual persona, melancholia transfigures Sontag into a beautiful modernist ruin. This chapter explores the connection from the vantage point of the archive. We shall see how, in the archive, Sontag’s fidelity to modernism becomes, in fact, her relation to theory, and she re-emerges as a mind among the theorists. The chapter illuminates the understudied role and place of Sontag in the critical movement called ‘theory’.<br>

After ’68, there were many groups, very different groups, but necessarily compact ones. It was post-68. They survived; they all had a past.

The problem is not so much that the question is not answered by Deleuze and Guattari or that it is somehow unanswerable; rather the problem is that it has several answers. Unwilling to provide any kind of ‘formula’ or ‘model’ that would enable us to simply ‘do’ schizoanalysis as a tick-box exercise in which everything relates inexorably to one single factor (e.g. the family), which is what they thought psychoanalysis had become, Deleuze and Guattari observe a quite deliberate strategy of providing multiple answers to the questions their work raises.<br>

Over the following days, weeks and months, newspapers and other media the world over contained reactions, responses, comments and obituaries to him. Many of these were surprisingly hostile; they were often irreverent and disrespectful; and often also mocking, joking and scornful. Some were starkly abusive and aggressive. In fact, many obituaries, reactions and responses to the news of Derrida’s death attacked or slandered not only his work but also cast aspersions on his character and personality. A large proportion made crass jokes about whether we<br>

  Author(s) Cronin Ciaran<br>
  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces. In psychoanalysis, this concept also designates<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Blackledge Paul<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘revolution’ was first used in an unmistakably modern sense in the eighteenth century to describe the American and French Revolutions. And although it had begun to gravitate towards something like this modern meaning in England in the wake of her seventeenth-century revolutions (Williams 1976; Hill 1991; Hobsbawm 1962: 74–5), John Dunn is right that ‘in a few short months, in the year of 1789, the people of France set their stamp ineffaceably on a political idea which has loomed over the history of the world ever since’ (Dunn 2008: 17). In fact, as Krishan Kumar points out,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Gillespie Michael<br>
  Abstract: The term ‘nihilism’ has been used to denote a philosophical concept or position, a psychological or sociological state or mood, a doctrine or agenda for political action and a cultural condition or movement. Moreover, the connotations of the term within each of these areas are multiple, complicated and contested. It is thus not easy to define the term or to determine the nature of the phenomenon that the term describes. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that the term has been principally used as a pejorative by opponents to characterise a condition, doctrine, or movement that they fear, disagree<br>

  Author(s) Belsey Catherine<br>
  Abstract: How important is textual analysis in research? What is it? How is it done? And what difference does it make? My contention will be that textual analysis is indispensable to research in cultural criticism, where cultural criticism includes English, cultural history and cultural studies, as well as any other discipline that focuses on texts, or seeks to understand the inscription of culture in its artefacts. And since textual analysis is in the end empirical, I shall set out to exemplify my methodological account with a single instance. The project is to imagine that Titian’s painting of

  Author(s) Hui Victoria Tin-bor<br>
  Abstract: Both Western and Chinese analysts often presume that democracy is unique to Western civilisation and alien to the Chinese. The roots of Western dynamism are, in turn, assumed to derive from the political complexity of Europe, whereas those of Chinese stagnation from political unity. However, as this chapter illustrates, China in fact experienced fluctuations between unification and division in history. Intense international competition in the classical era (770–221 BCE) gave rise to citizenship rights defined as state– society bargains over the means of war. Although the development of Chinese citizenship was aborted by Qin’s successful unification of the Warring<br>

  Author(s) Phillips David J.<br>
  Abstract: The term
                  dēmokratiamost probably dates back to 508/7¹ (Ehrenberg 1950; Hansen 1986, 1991: 69–71; Sealey 1973). At that time in the Athenianpolis(city-state), the aristocratic Kleisthenes ‘took the people (demos) into his faction’ (Aristotle [332 BCE] 1984: 20.1; Herodotus [430 bce ] 1972: 5.66.2). He did so in order to gain the upper hand in his struggle for political power with the aristocratic and Spartan-backed Isagoras who had been elected as the eponymousarchonfor 508/7. These two men contested power in the aftermath of the tyranny of the Peisistratids (545– 511/10), which had curbed the opportunities<br>

  Author(s) Matyszak Philip<br>
  Abstract: Although this chapter takes a broader view, democracy in Rome is generally considered in the context of the mid-to late Republic. The view that the oligarchy exercised
                  de factocontrol of the voting process in this latter period has been challenged from the 1990s onward (Millar 2002). The ensuing debate has exposed extensive deficiencies in what is known about the democratic process in Rome (Sandberg 2001). Recently the focus has shifted to the role of the army, a focus which will be retained in this chapter (Southern 2007). It will also be stressed that throughout the history of Rome, voting<br>

  Author(s) Johansen Bruce E.<br>
  Abstract: Europe did not discover America, but America was quite a discovery for Europe. For roughly three centuries before the American Revolution, the ideas that made the American Revolution possible were being discovered, nurtured and embellished in the growing English and French colonies of North America. America provided a counterpoint for European convention and assumption. It became, for Europeans in America, at once a dream and a reality, a fact and a fantasy, the real and the ideal. To appreciate the way in which European eyes opened on the ‘new world’, we must take the phrase literally, with the excitement<br>

  Chapter 28  Women’s Suffrage from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Sowerwine Charles<br>
  Abstract: Historians have often treated the introduction of women’s suffrage as a narrative of linear progress. In this view, women’s exclusion from the suffrage resulted from ageold prejudices, which, gradually and inevitably, gave way to modern egalitarian ideas. Recent scholarship, however, has complicated this story by emphasising the intractability of the issue. Enlightenment and republican discourse talked in universal terms, but constructed the citizen as public man in opposition to private woman, creating a feminine ‘other’ in order to create a ‘universal’, which was in fact gendered, masculine (Sowerwine 2010: 19). The idea of equal rights and the subordination<br>

  Abstract: Political communication and the means of its production and diffusion have always been a significant factor shaping the nature of democratic politics. From the oral tradition of the
                  Agora, through the pamphlets and newspapers of early modern Europe, to the prevalence of the mass broadcast media in the twentieth century, the communicative power of citizens has been influenced by their access to and use of the prevailing media technologies.

  Abstract: If, as I have argued in this book, the pattern of reading that is found in deconstruction can be understood as an unconditional ethical demand in the Levinasian sense, then is this in itself an adequate response to the question of politics? If deconstruction can provide new resources for thinking about ethical responsibility, then does this also entail a satisfactory account of political responsibility? What is the political moment in deconstruction? Can deconstruction provide an account of justice and a just polity? More precisely, as I asked at the end of chapter 1, what is the relation between the rigorous<br>

  Abstract: In her book 
                  Evil in Modern Thought, Susan Neiman argues that the root of the problem of evil can be found in the fact that the world is not as it ought to be.¹ Around us, we see needless suffering, callous and thoughtless cruelties, monstrous atrocities, unjust punishments and so much more which makes us cry out: This ought not to have happened! Once we utter this cry, Neiman thinks that we are ‘stepping onto a path that leads straight to the problem of evil’.² That is, once we admit that reality is not as it ought to be, that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Streete Adrian<br>
  Abstract: For the nineteenth-century French composer, Hector Berlioz, Shakespeare offered more than artistic inspiration. In fact, the playwright and his works acted as a prism through which the composer understood and rationalized his personal and professional successes and failures, indeed his very identity. Berlioz first discovered Shakespeare in 1827, an event he describes in his 
                  Memoires (1870) with typically Romantic effusion: “This sudden and unexpected revelation of Shakespeare overwhelmed me. The lightening flash of his genius revealed the whole heaven of art to me, illuminating its remotest depths in a single flash” (Berlioz, 1932, 66; see Schmidgall, 1990, 272–9; Cairns,<br>

  Author(s) Scott-Douglass Amy<br>
  Abstract: Children’s Shakespeare is far from being young. In fact, it is more than 200 years old. From the first editions, printed in 1807, to current day adaptations, authors and illustrators have found in Shakespeare’s work ample material for retellings geared to youngsters.¹ This essay will look at the philosophies of children’s Shakespeare, and theories and practices of adaptation over the last two centuries. It will discuss several adaptations by the major figures of children’s Shakespeare: Henrietta and Thomas Bowdler, Mary and Charles Lamb, Edith Nesbit, Marchette Chutte, Leon Garfield, Lois Burdett, Marcia Williams and Tina Packer – along with other, non-canonical<br>

  Abstract: In Chapter 2 we discussed Jaspers’ account of the notion of death and the distinction between death as an objective fact and death that gives rise to a boundary situation. We noted that one’s Dasein perishes at death. 
                     Existenz, one’s true self, however, ‘knows no death’, that is to say, it is deathless.¹ We also noted that the ‘deathlessness’ of Existenz within the Jaspersian framework does not imply immortality in the traditional sense of the term. In other words, there is no continued existence for Existenz after death.<br>

  Abstract: Having constructed a conceptualisation of the mind and its connection to its surroundings as well as having painted a picture of the present environment it finds itself in, the psychological possibility of critique remains to be examined. It is easy to state that the mind is shaped wholly by a combination of neurophysical parameters and social experience, but the very fact that one feels so resistant to this idea shows the merits of deeper examination. Consciousness rebels against the notion that its limits can be so circumscribed and the artistic, cultural and philosophical labour of our species is a record<br>

It would be a caricature to represent the dominant paradigm in contemporary Anglo-American philosophy of mind as holding of all our psychological states, ‘It’s only chemicals.’ Yet this paradigm – functionalism – does hold that each of them is, in fact, a physiological state, but one individuated in terms of its function in mediating between sensory inputs<br>

  Abstract: Several factors converged in the 1770s to bolster interest among Dissenters in their own history. First, in 1767 the long, wearying legal battle between the City of London Corporation and the Protestant Dissenting Deputies came to end when six out of seven Law Lords decided in favour of the Dissenting position.¹ By Lord Mansfield’s judgment, Dissent was legally secured. Dissenting religious worship was, he said, ‘not only exempted from punishment, but rendered innocent and lawful: it is established, it is put under the protection, and is not merely under the connivance of the law’.²<br>

However, I have not tried to do so by showing ‘how, after all, the analytic/Continental distinction [can] be drawn’² but, rather, by showing why, after all, it cannot. Yet so pervasive is the 
                  de facto distinction, so serious the breakdown in communication, that we find it hard to resist the idea that there must be something to the distinction. This is where it gets hard to keep<br>

  Chapter 3  The Other Self as Friend from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r26hc">Philosophy and Friendship</a><br>
  Abstract: Cicero believed that human beings find it hard to make light of power and will cast friendship aside in the interests of attaining power and influence. His most scathing commentary on this tendency is that those who engage in this kind of defection from the duties of friendship assume that their behaviour will not be open to serious criticism; such men take it that others will assume that only an extremely important reason could have led them to cast friendship aside. Cicero presents power, influence, manipulation and weakness as factors both intimately related and antithetical to the practice of friendship.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r288w">The Lacanian Left</a><br>
  Abstract: I started the previous chapter with an observation regarding the importance that questions of identity have gradually acquired. It would be bizarre if the broad field of international relations were to stay untouched by this trend. In fact, no one is surprised any more by the fact that ‘the discipline of international relations (IR) is witnessing a surge of interest in identity and identity formation’ (Neumann 1999:1). The same applies to the sub-discipline of European Studies – affecting both marginal and mainstream approaches. As Anthony Smith has pointed out, one of the fundamental reasons for the current interest in ‘European unification’<br>

  Abstract: In the 1980s, when Hamilton Finlay’s garden was coming to maturity, another Scottish poet created an institution aimed at regaining poetry’s relationship with the natural world. The International Institute of Geopoetics in Paris was launched in 1989 by Glasgow-born Kenneth White, then Professor of Twentieth-Century Poetics at the Sorbonne. Geopoetics was a response to the fact that ‘it was becoming more and more obvious that the earth (the biosphere) was in danger and that ways, both deep and efficient, would have to be worked out in order to protect it’, and that what was required was a return to ‘the<br>

  Author(s) Zeleza Paul Tiyambe<br>
  Abstract: If communication is the lifeblood of human interaction, the media constitute the veins through which it flows. The media have a multiplicity of forms, functions, and impacts. They exist in oral, literary and visual forms; they are transmitted through print, audiovisual, and digital technologies; and they play communicative, creative, and representational roles. As a whole, or in specific artifacts and genres, the media have varied social, economic and political effects that can promote democracy, development, nation building and inclusion as much as they can sustain authoritarianism, exploitation, conflict and exclusion.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r2cd5">The Scots Imagination and Modern Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: The conventional logic of landscape evaluation is that the Romantic Movement was a conservative response to the onset of modernity, emphasising the need to develop ‘culture’ as moral salvation against the instability of urbanisation and industrialisation. Its legacy has seen a supposedly preexisting Arcadia touted as ‘authentic’ for a public that misrecognises fabrication for historical fact. Arguably, alienated from their own acts of creation, cultural producers have reified their own constructions, believing likewise that these reflect a sacred essence of ‘natural beauty’. Icons abound. What more can be said about the social construction of the Scottish landscape?<br>

For Eisenstein, however, the relation between the facts of world and their reproduction on the screen was in some ways more complex.

  Abstract: The immediate post-war period saw the publication of a number of secret service accounts recounting wartime exploits, giving the impression that, with the end of hostilities, these could now be revealed.¹ In fact, as has been clearly demonstrated by Richard J.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I will reread an overdetermined and complex event in the prehistory of psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud’s so-called ‘cocaine episode’ from the 1880s, in which, prior to entering private practice as a psychiatrist, Freud attempted a kind of reputational ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme, staking his scientific credentials on what has appeared to many subsequent commentators as unethical drug experimentation. While I re-examine this event by drawing on the requisite historical facts and secondary literature, my aim is different from that of a standard revisionist account. In fine, I wish to show something quite counter-intuitive: how Freud came to imagine the possibility<br>

The ongoing psychiatric, pharmaceutical and philosophical assault against psychoanalysis is one thing; the loss of its very basis for being is quite another. The first, as I have shown throughout this book, is hardly the threat to psychoanalysis that it is often supposed to be; but the second would be fatal. The second, in fact,<br>

Despite the distinction and importance of his other novels, Flaubert had to reconcile himself to the fact that he became known, once and forever, as the author ofMadame Bovary. The popularity of the novel has increased rather than diminished with time.

  Abstract: A long tradition of research, interpretation, and speculation about international politics goes under the name of realism. Although some dispute the pedigree as simply a “construction” of contemporary analysts, in fact a number of writers whose roster includes Machiavelli, Rousseau, Meinecke, von Gentz, Morgenthau, and Waltz, to name just a few, share a number of common themes such as their images of the world, their understanding of historical processes, the dilemmas and paradoxes that are peculiar to states that exist in a condition of anarchy, and the normative primacy of security in such an environment.

  Author(s) Leng Russell J.<br>
  Abstract: One way to provide an accounting of the state of quantitative international politics at the turn of the millennium is by evaluating its record against the skepticism of its early critics. Traditional international relations scholars, in fact, took a rather jaundiced view of the scientific study of world politics when the subfield was in its infancy at the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century. One of the most skeptical critiques came from the British classicist Hedley Bull who argued that the scientific approach was “likely to contribute very little to the theory of international relations, and in<br>

  Abstract: When Descartes complained that the Ancients had misunderstood the nature and quality of the passions of the soul, in his work of the same name (1649), he drew on the brain’s mechanisms, as well as the fibrous ligaments called nerves, to describe the motion of the body, soul, and passions.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.5339783">The Real and the Sacred</a><br>
  Abstract: Mid-nineteenth-century portraits of Jesus were not as controversial in fiction as they were in realist painting. Whereas John Everett Millais, Nikolai Ge, and Édouard Manet broke with long-standing iconographic traditions, portraits of Jesus in fiction from the same time period were innovative, in large part, by the fact of their existence. Extended literary portraits are not a common feature of premodern imaginative retellings of gospel narrative. The life of Jesus, as the canonical gospels suggest, need not accommodate descriptions of the Christ image. In the 1830s and 1840s, authors of fiction began hesitantly to describe the body of Jesus thanks<br>

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

  Author(s) Kleinman Kent<br>
  Abstract: It is conventional and useful for both architects and archivists to recognize that architecture exists in two distinct modes: first, the built artifact and, second, representations of that artifact. This division is useful precisely because it allows architecture in the second sense to be collected, cataloged, and protected by archival institutions without the necessity of dealing with the messy business of built work. The Le Corbusier Foundation in Paris does not collect buildings by the French master, although it is housed in one; the Mies van der Rohe archive at the Museum of Modern Art in New York contains not<br>

  Abstract: Whether even the most well-intentioned and neutral scholar could ever produce an objective, scientific history has long been the subject of fractious debate among historians, as many archivists are aware. That “noble dream,” as Peter Novick described this quest in an important volume some fifteen years ago, reflects for many historians a quaint legacy of romantic positivism, the failure to recognize how facts and historical truths are accessible only through creative acts of imagination.¹ The issues here are complicated. They range from whether the kinds of presuppositions historians bring to their research necessarily affect their determination of what is “factual,”<br>

  Abstract: Frank Mecklenburg discusses the Leo Baeck Institute (LBI) Archives as an institution initially established for the preservation and generation of social memories among a group whose collective identity—as the much-mythologized German-speaking Jews of prewar central Europe—is rapidly fading, as well as a repository whose contents are increasingly relevant not only to scholarship but to the highly contested production of political culture for both Jews and Germans. The texts, photographs, and artifacts contained in the archives have long provided fodder for well-trodden academic debates about the fate of German Jewry: cultural symbiosis versus failed assimilation, proud legacy of cosmopolitan<br>

  Abstract: In late 2001, the Canadian Council on Archives, a publicly funded agency that oversees archival development in Canada, launched the Canadian Archival Information Network (CAIN), an online network of Web sites and databases designed to bring together intellectually the spectrum of activity taking place in archival repositories across the country. The network aims to provide electronic access to information about archives through searchable fonds-level archival descriptions, along with news and facts about archival programs.

  Abstract: Do all objects tell the truth? Are artifacts essential to the study of history? Can we understand the past by looking and examining the things people used and made, as Henry Ford believed? The study of material culture, which grew out of anthropology and the study of preliterate cultures, has had only a minor influence in the historical profession. Texts and, to a lesser degree, visual evidence have been the primary sources for the reconstruction of the historic past. What can the study of material culture offer the study of history?<br>

  Abstract: Across the globe and within local communities, people suffer from disease, disability, and early mortality at vastly different rates from one another. Some of these differences, such as those that stem from impoverished environmental conditions or a lack of access to health care, strike many observers as unjust; others, such as those that reflect choices to engage in potentially dangerous elite sports, may seem to have little to do with justice. How we understand the relationship between health inequalities and justice is influenced by many factors, including notions of deservingness, choice, vulnerability, luck, cultural and familial practices, and social group<br>

The

  Abstract: Today in France they frequently say that the novel is dying, that the novel is dead. That is one of the leitmotivs of postwar criticism. Nevertheless, if you loiter by the bookshop windows, or prowl among the editors’ offices, you cannot help being struck by the great number of books and manuscripts that flaunt the label “novel.” Nor are they dead works, for many of them are received by the public with enthusiasm.

Measuring change for intangible cultural heritage remains a complicated process, but sociolinguists have found ways to address issues of language shift that may contribute helpful models for assessing music shift as well. Without drawing overly strict, problematic parallels between language and music (Tilley 2014, 487), sociolinguistic and other communication-based models can be modified effectively for measuring change in forms of artistic expression. In addition, these approaches highlight key factors related to resilience, thereby providing strategic insights into encouraging<br>

Quite often, one’s life, including but not limited to one’s reform, was broadly described (for example, one previously enjoyed a “fast” lifestyle that was condemned) but specific crimes were neutralized. Second, desistance, like offending, was attributed to vaguely stated factors. In addition, desistance was conceptualized<br>

  Abstract: In approaching Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) philosophically, one immediately runs into the oldest and most cherished conundrum with respect to female philosophers. It appears to be the case that many female thinkers whose work might be deemed to be philosophical wrote in styles that were somewhat nonstandard, even for their respective times. Thus, arguments have frequently been made that such women are absent from the canon because of the fact that their work was demonstrably nonphilosophical, rather than due to their sex.

I begin in the melancholy and portentous mise-en-scène of the graveyard, the place where the dead lie among the living, where, as Joe Roach provocatively suggests, the tomb functions as a stage on which history is enacted. Roach, who argues that history is a theater of surrogates who stand in place of the dead, makes an intriguing comparison between the grave and performance. “A theatrical role,” he writes, “like a stone effigy on a tomb, has a certain longevity in time, but its special durability stems from the fact that it must be re-fleshed at<br>

  Abstract: If fashion is a language, albeit one marked by a low semantic level, then accessories can be taken as special indicators of the meaning of clothing. Idiosyncratically arranged, they are able to create both stable structures and variations on a theme. As a starting point I would like to use Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of “multiaccentuality” and its appropriation by Stuart Hall, who adopts it as a benchmark for his encoding/decoding model.¹ His analysis of these modes of arrangement reveals decisive turning points in the social history of the tie.² Hidden within this accessory, in fact, is a symbolic potential that<br>

The object of humanities inquiry is the cultural artifact, of which text is almost always a primary component. In the last decade or so, however, with the growth of predominantly digital environments in which the humanities now function, these objects and the approaches used to study them have changed significantly. Apart from texts (in the form of written material), images and audiovisual archival objects have added new dimensions to humanities research, creating potential for unique modes of inquiry while also imposing<br>

  Author(s) TWETEN LISA<br>
  Abstract: The increasing amount of digital projects relating to the field of antiquity is especially promising for the future of traditionally archaic academic fields, including Ancient History, Classics, and Classical Archaeology. An enormous number of fragile, irreplaceable artifacts have survived from antiquity, but only a small number are accessible to the public. The vast majority are housed in storage rooms or isolated collections in museums and universities, as well as private collections around the world. For decades, this global scattering of antiquity resulted in widespread inaccessibility to ancient artifacts for both teaching and research. Through the process of digitization and the<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we describe three experiences of collaboratively reverse engineering historical electronic artifacts at the University of Western Ontario’s Lab for Humanistic Fabrication, a setting that supports hands-on fabrication and experimentation, programming and computer-aided design, and traditional historical research. Our first case study comes from Elliott’s work on the re-creation of wireless effects designed by early-twentieth-century magicians to simulate mind reading. These effects depended on electromagnetic induction, a technique that has recently come to prominence for its applications in radio-frequency ID tagging, wireless charging, and near-field and secure wireless communications, largely driven by interest in the Internet of Things.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter develops a brief historical and theoretical overview of hardware hacking within the context of electronic music instruments, suggesting how component-level analysis of some specific artifacts can help scholars to appreciate accelerating shifts in musical production as well as larger cultural trends. The chapter does not promote hardware hacking as an optimal solution for every musician. Rather, it recognizes hacking as a long-lasting and self-sustaining technocultural practice. This recognition is achieved in part by developing an adapted understanding of Anthony Dunne’s “post-optimal electronics” (2005). Such understanding investigates what makes electronic instrument design unique, how each artist bends the traditions<br>

This is flattering, and in seeking to differentiate the dynamics of the meeting place from their larger theorizations of a politically emancipatory intercultural domain, the object is not to prove either priority or superiority.

It creates scope for solitude: not everyone is lonely in the crowd. Even in the meeting place meeting is exceptional. In fact, in a way, the intention of the informal choreographies that characterize the collective movement form of the public is to avoid a face-to-face encounter.

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

Archival photographs are brought into the light by someone preparing a monograph, research report, calendar illustration, slide show, exhibit, article, or argument, and then circulated and seen in ways that neither the camera operator nor the photograph’s subjects could ever have anticipated.

Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state.

Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

Psychoanalysis ventured forth without an alibi—with no excuse, as it were. This is one of Derrida’s recent themes: that psychoanalysis met head-on with unbearable examples of suffering, but took no recourse to theology.

  Abstract: While outlining a philosophy of “fine art,” Hegel offered some advice to the nascent discipline of art history. It could be summed up, more or less, as “stick to the facts.” Of course philosophy would forge the aesthetic-theoretical hardwiring of the field. If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned<br>

  Abstract: Ever resisting the temptation to be born again, even today, as we mark the one-hundredth anniversary of its initializing text, psychoanalysis was from the start just about the only one to confront human cruelty, the punishing aspects of the psyche, without a theological alibi—in fact, with no alibi or safety net. Psychoanalysis ventured forth without an alibi—with no excuse, as it were. This is one of Derrida’s recent themes: that psychoanalysis met head-on with unbearable examples of suffering, but took no recourse to theology. It may have scanned monotheism, or even served as witness for Dr. Schreber when<br>

  Author(s) McNamara Andrew<br>
  Abstract: While outlining a philosophy of “fine art,” Hegel offered some advice to the nascent discipline of art history. It could be summed up, more or less, as “stick to the facts.” Of course philosophy would forge the aesthetic-theoretical hardwiring of the field. If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy Beside Itself-On Deconstruction and Modernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The writings of French philosopher Jacques Derrida have been the single most powerful influence on critical theory and practice in the United States over the past decade. But with few exceptions American philosophers have taken little or no interest in Derrida’s work, and the task of reception, translation, and commentary has been left to literary critics. As a result, Derrida has appeared as a figure already defined by essentially literary critical activities and interests. Stephen Melville’s aim in Philosophy Beside Itself is to insist upon and clarify the distinctions between philosophy and criticism. He argues that until we grasp Derrida’s philosophical project as such, we remain fundamentally unable to see his significance for criticism. In terms derived from Stanley Cavell’s writings on modernism, Melville develops a case for Derrida as a modernist philosopher, working at once within and against that tradition and discipline. Melville first places Derrida in a Hegelian context, the structure of which he explores by examining the work of Heidegger, Lacan, and Bataille. With this foundation, he is able to reappraise the project of deconstructive criticism as developed in Paul de Man’s Blindness and Insight and further articulated by other Yale critics. Central to this critique is the ambivalent relationship between deconstructive criticism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Criticism—radical self-criticism—is a central means through which the difficult facts of human community come to recognition, and Melville argues for criticism as an activity intimately bound to the ways in which we do and do not belong in time and in community. Derrida’s achievement has been to find a new and necessary way to assert that the task of philosophy is criticism; the task of literary criticism is to assume the burden of that achievement. Stephen Melville is an assistant professor of English at Syracuse University, and Donald Marshall is a professor of English at the University of Iowa.<br>

  Abstract: There is one incessant history: the history of the body, the history of its adventures and misadventures. Throughout the life of their country, Colombian writers have narrated the history of the body, invoking different words and thus weaving this history in quite diverse ways. We propose here to narrate the history of these words, a more modest history, as are all those written in modern times.¹ This would have been impossible were it not for the extraordinary and sad atmosphere that has enveloped Colombia for many years.

  Abstract: There are few topics in contemporary cultural production that are more controversial, that more divide individuals into entrenched positions, than pornography. While pornography may be a central fact of human artistic expression, as archaeology and historical studies have amply demonstrated (cf.
                  The Invention of Pornographyfor its relationship to modern culture in general), there is yet no adequate resolution as to how to interpret its role in a global conception of cultural production. For some, typically today such implausible bedfellows as religious fundamentalists (Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography—the so-calledMeese Report)and politically correct, interventionist feminists (paradigmatically, Dworkin and Dworkin,<br>

  Author(s): KRISHNA SANKARAN<br>
  Abstract: This ambitious work explores the vexed connections among nation building, ethnic identity, and regional conflict by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military intervention in the ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. Postcolonial Insecurities counters the perception of “ethnicity” as an inferior and subversive principle compared with the progressive ideal of the “nation.” Krishna, in fact, shows ethnicity to be indispensable to the production and reproduction of the nation itself.<br>

  Abstract: At least since Benedict Anderson breathed new life into the thought of Walter Benjamin, Ernst Renan, and Victor Turner, nationalism has constituted a prominent conceptual feature of contemporary literary and cultural studies. Following the lead of Perry Anderson, Anthony Giddens, and others, academics in English literary studies, by and large, have restricted their analyses to artifacts produced since the late eighteenth century, when the American and French revolutions launched the processes that gave rise to both a modern state founded on popular sovereignty and the appearance in the lexicon of the word “nationalism” (Anderson,

  Abstract: Time and again the United Nations has deployed peacekeeping missions in trouble spots around the globe: Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda. Has peace ensued? Have these missions, in fact, made any difference in the disorder and destruction they are purported to forestall? Or are they, as François Debrix contends in this critical revisiting of UN interventions, an illusion-more virtual peacekeeping than actual interventions in international affairs?<br>

  Abstract: The United Nations intervention in Somalia from January 1992 to April 1995 offers itself to us as a movie. Reading Somalia as a cinematographic fiction is not only made possible by the explosion of visual media that this post–cold war intervention triggered.¹ It is also influenced by the actors themselves, the level of reality at which their actions take place, and the staged scenarios that they try to follow. In fact, Somalia is one of the first locations where the United Nations has actually been given the opportunity to demonstrate its acting talents. Reinvested by George Bush’s post–Gulf<br>

  Abstract: Fiction lies at the intersection of two fundamental modes of thinking. One is narrative, the set of cognitive operations that organizes and explains human agency and experience. Fiction does not necessarily fulfill all the conditions of narrativity that I have spelled out in chapter 1, but it must create a world by means of singular existential propositions, and it must offer, to the very least, an embryonic story.¹ The other mode of thinking is what we may variously call “off-line thinking,” “virtual thinking,” or “non factual thinking”: the ability to detach thought from what exists and to conduct mental experiments<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I propose to revisit a question that has split, but also animated and energized, the young academic discipline of video game studies: is the concept of narrative applicable to computer games, or does the status of an artifact as game preclude its status as narrative? This dilemma has come to be known as the ludology versus narrativism (or narratology) controversy. But the terms are slightly misleading, because the ludology camp enrolls the support of some influential narratologists, while the so-called narratology camp includes both straw men constructed by the ludologists to promote their position and game designers<br>

  Abstract: Music permeates the Quay Brothers’ studio. The rafters and corners are imbued with compositions from Eastern European composers, madrigals, violin sonatas, avant-garde instrumentals, more contemporary minimalist jazz, and shortwave recordings from distant lands. There is so much music, in fact, that the small lavatory functions as a “musithek,” the walls lined with hundreds of music tapes whose replaced covers are embellished with the Quays’ calligraphy and illustrations. Music is convoluted in discussions, gestures, and replies. On the topic of music in a 1996 interview, the Quays regarded themselves as “failed composers.

In the above passage from Jean Brunhes’ major work,

  Book Title: Modernist Commitments-Ethics, Politics, and Transnational Modernism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berman Jessica<br>
  Abstract: Jessica Berman demonstrates how modernist narrative connects ethical attitudes and responsibilities to the active creation of political relationships and the way we imagine justice. She challenges divisions between "modernist" and "committed" writing, arguing that a continuum of political engagement undergirds modernisms worldwide and that it is strengthened rather than hindered by formal experimentation. In addition to making the case for a transnational model of modernism, Berman shows how modernism's play with formal matters, its challenge to the boundaries between fact and fiction, its incorporation of vernacular and folkways, and its engagement with embodied experience and intimacy offer not only an expanded account of modernist texts and commitments but a new way of thinking about what modernism is and can do.<br>

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: This book tackles an obvious yet profound problem of modern political life: the disorientation of intellectuals and activists on the left. As the study of political history and theory has been usurped by cultural criticism, a confusion over the origins and objectives of progressive politics has been the result. Specifically, it has become fashionable for intellectuals to attack the Enlightenment for its imperialism, eurocentrism, and scientism, and for the sexism and racism of some of its major representatives. Although the fact that individual thinkers harbored such prejudices is irrefutable, Stephen Bronner argues that reducing the Enlightenment ethos to these beliefs is wholly unsustainable.<br>

  Abstract: Human rights is the global expression of a demand for civil liberty. Its origins derive from natural law and the European Enlightenment. Opposition to “rights” from the 
                  ancien régime was fierce, however, and it took a few hundred ideas for the idea to permeate the mainstream discourse. Human rights only gained currency after Auschwitz and Hiroshima and, in fact, it became popular in the United States only during the presidency of Jimmy Carter in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.

  Author(s) EDER KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: The theory of social evolution plays a key role in the foundation of Habermas’s theory of communicative action. Since Marx, the evolutionary perspective has struggled with the fact that the position the observer occupies must necessarily be, at the same time, the endpoint of the process in question—and therefore a point of teleological narrowness restricting the scope of social theory. Over time, this problem has lost none of its actuality for projects that seek to address processes of societal development.

  Abstract: Key to the social philosophy of Jürgen Habermas is his deeply held conviction that social evolution represents a history of progress in principle while at the same time—and as a matter of actual fact—being the cause of grave social ills. His project is shaped, then, by an awareness of suffering and crisis—matters that do not even occur to neoconservative and neoliberal modernizers, entranced as they are by technical and economic development.

  Abstract: Must utopia remain utopian, or can it be achieved without at the same time announcing its own end? This question helps to orient an examination of Fredric Jameson’s engagement with utopia and the critical insights about society that come with it. In early work such as “Reification and Utopia in Mass Culture” (1979), Jameson articulates how cultural artifacts contain twin utopian and ideological components, with the latter never managing to preclude the former. In more recent work such as “The Politics of Utopia” (2004), Jameson claims that utopian thinking flourishes when we find politics has been suspended. This raises a<br>

Some of these changes were the result of gene mutation, the prime factor in natural selection, as over time alternative procedures aided their users to survive and reproduce and were thereby passed along to their descendants. Other innovations, learned by imitation, were transmitted through cultural evolution. Nonhuman animals show little or no capacity for innovation. Our nearest evolutionary cousins, the chimpanzees, for example, have the innate ability to hurl things, yet they cannot learn how<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/ingr16110">Radical Cosmopolitics</a><br>
  Abstract: At its classical origins, we saw in the last chapter, cosmopolitanism was first of all matter of consciousness and conviction. Even today, it belongs first and foremost to the field of ethics, especially if we take the latter in its etymological sense. As among the eighteenth-century 
                  philosophes, the most common use of the term cosmopolitan today is to describe how people live (or aspire to live)—their ethos, culture, worldview, or way of life. The rise of cosmopolitanism in this sense was seized on in the 1990s as one of the most striking facts about the contemporary world, and the<br>

  Abstract: Reality has been
                  communistfor a few years now. The Cold War was won by capitalism, but current events are imposing problems that place care for thecommunalrather than care for the individual at the center of our concerns. Globalization is often associated with privatization (with economic liberalization or the movement of certain goods and services toward the marketplace), but it can also be understood as an increase in what is public, the fact that societies are more interdependent. The political agenda is now full of common problems, of universal public goods. I am not talking about a battle<br>

  Book Title: Harmattan-A Philosophical Fiction<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

  Book Title: Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon-A History of the Internationalization of Communal Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Khalaf Samir<br>
  Abstract: Lebanon's fragmented political culture is a byproduct of two general features. First, it reflects the traditional forces and political conflicts caused by striking differences in religious beliefs and communal and sectarian loyalties that continue to split the society and reinforce its factional character. Second, and superimposed on these, are new forms of socioeconomic and cultural stress caused by Lebanon's role in the continuing international conflicts in the region.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/khal12476">Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon</a><br>
  Abstract: A defining element in Lebanon’s checkered sociopolitical history, one that has had substantive implications for the character and magnitude of collective strife, is the survival and reassertion of communal solidarities. In fact, the three overarching and persisting features—(1) foreign intervention, (2) the reawakening of primordial identities, and (3) the escalation of protracted violence—are all intimately related. This is, after all, what informs the major thrust of this study. We will, in subsequent chapters, identify and account for the various forms foreign intervention has assumed. More explicitly, an effort will be made to explore how the unresolved regional and<br>

  Abstract: For almost two decades, Lebanon was besieged and beleaguered by every possible form of brutality and collective terror known to human history: from the cruelties of factional and religious bigotry to the massive devastations wrought by private militias and state-sponsored armies. They have all generated an endless carnage of innocent victims and an immeasurable toll in human suffering. Even by the most moderate of estimates, the magnitude of such damage to human life and property is staggering. About 170,000 people have perished; twice as many were wounded or disabled; close to two thirds of the population experienced some from of<br>

  Abstract: Recently, Charles Taylor, among others, has written about the different meanings that are attached to the concept of secularization.¹ It seems clear from his analysis that we have only just become aware of the difficulties and problems that the term 
                  secularization suggests. The apparent separation of church and state and the ways we think about how religion and politics might interact are now open questions. Indeed, it is no longer unusual to see that political theorists from both the left and right are prepared to give up what we once took for granted, namely, the fact that, in modernity, religion<br>

  Abstract: It is worth noting that prior to this, however, the Japanese colonial period received relatively little academic attention (Chang 1983:15–16).

  Book Title: Contemporary Romanian Cinema-The History of an Unexpected Miracle<br>
  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): NASTA DOMINIQUE<br>
  Abstract: Over the last decade, audiences worldwide have become familiar with highly acclaimed films from the Romanian New Wave such as
      4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days(2007),The Death of Mr. Lazarescu(2005), and12:08 East of Bucharest(2006). However, the hundred or so years of Romanian cinema leading to these accomplishments have been largely overlooked. This book is the first to provide in-depth analyses of essential works ranging from the silent period to contemporary productions. In addition to relevant information on historical and cultural factors influencing contemporary Romanian cinema, this volume covers the careers of daring filmmakers who approached various genres despite fifty years of Communist censorship. An important chapter is dedicated to Lucian Pintilie, whose seminal work,Reconstruction(1969), strongly inspired Romania's 21st-century innovative output. The book's second half closely examines both the 'minimalist' trend (Cristian Mungiu, Cristi Puiu, Corneliu Porumboiu, Radu Muntean) and the younger, but no less inspired, directors who have chosen to go beyond the 1989 revolution paradigm by dealing with the complexities of contemporary Romania.<br>

As was the case with other auteurs, his work has only been partially shown to non-domestic audiences and still needs to be reconsidered for a number of reasons.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

Let me begin with the most visible phenomena surrounding the renewal of religion, which are also the most vaguely defined. This is what we might call, following the title of a book published in France a few years ago, the triumph of God. The current Catholic pope has an extraordinary audience among non-Catholics and nonbelievers, in part because of his contribution to the collapse of the<br>

  Abstract: All the various bodies of scriptures evoked by the name “Buddhist canon”—such as the Pali canon, the Tibetan canon, the Mongolian canon, and the Chinese canon, just to mention those surviving in a more or less complete form—are in fact very different things from the viewpoint of their internal structure and formative principles. They were shaped by different historical forces, in response to different cultural and political conditions. All these differences are partly masked by the use of unifying terms such as “canon,” “Tripitaka,” etc., to refer to these collections.

  Abstract: Nowadays the term “modernization” has lost much of the popularity it once enjoyed during the 1950s in the heyday of American modernization theory. In recent academic discourse, the place of “modernization” has been taken over by a number of “posts” beginning with “postmodern.” It is significant to note, however, that as early as the 1970s, some of the leading modernization theorists already found it necessary to reformulate the original thesis by way of clarification or modification. As a response to a widespread dissatisfaction with many of the assumptions of initial modernization studies, Daedalus devoted a whole special issue in 1973<br>

Las guerras de guerrillas y los acuerdos de paz, en parte, determinan la naturaleza de los regímenes políticos, al alterar la relación que existe entre el Estado y la sociedad. Abordar las relaciones entre estos tres factores es importante, porque considerarlos en forma independiente ha sido una fuente de confusiones analíticas.

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

  Abstract: Apart from the fact that they were both prominent architects in socialist Yugoslavia, at first sight, Vjenceslav Richter (1917–2002) and Bogdan Bogdanović (1922–2010) do not seem to have much in common. The former was an avantgardist known for light, cool, geometricized structures that explored the limits of modernist tropes of abstraction, technology, and space. The latter created exuberant, allusive, symbolically charged monuments, often rustically hand-carved out of stone, which evoked a distant history rather than projecting the visions of a brave future. Even at a second look, there is not much that connects them, as they emerged out<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Earthly Things-Aztec Gods and God-Bodies<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

Recognizing the fragility and importance of the artifacts, we recorded and published detailed descriptions, including knot types and placement, cord and space measurements, and colors, for each khipu we studied (Ascher and Ascher 1978, 1988).

Another such example is the closely related activity of talking; that is, we

For words themselves are always efforts at explanation, yet insofar as words, spoken or written or printed or processed electronically, never provide total explanation, they invite further interpretation, the completion of the business they have left unfinished. Utterance of any sort is always in some sense un-finished business. One can conclude verbal exchange quite satisfactorily and arrive at truth when what is at stake in a given situation is cleared up.

  Abstract: Our text-centered mentality, and especially our print-centered mentality, can and does create special illusions about the nature of “facts” which affects concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics. By habituating us to visually fixed representations of spoken words texts can lead us to overvalue fixity itself. We tend to think of a “fact” as in some sense something fixed. Yet its fixity is paradoxical, for a fact can only be identified by the use of words. And words are not fixed, for they are events in time. Moreover, there is no one thing to say about anything—a fact which seems to<br>

  Abstract: Our text-centered mentality, and especially our print-centered mentality, can and does create special illusions about the nature of “facts” which affects concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics.

  Prologue. from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1xx5gp">Inconceivable Effects</a><br>
  Abstract: A book including the word “ethics” on its cover invokes, for better or for worse, a certain professional affiliation with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, the philosophical branch of ethics. This book, however, is neither written 
                  by a philosopher, nor is it, strictly speaking, written for philosophers. As a matter of fact, philosophers, especially those who professionally concern themselves with questions of ethics, will likely perceive this book to be a great disappointment. The book will disappoint professional philosophers because it conceives ethics in an extremely flexible sense as it arises out of the reading of individual texts<br>

  Abstract: When explaining what she was doing, Hannah Arendt typically provided the term “storytelling.”¹ The storyteller, Arendt writes in the essay “Truth and Politics,” confronts the seeming arbitrariness of the facts presented, constructing certain configurations of “brutally elementary data” that eventually transcend the “meaning” of the chaos of sheer events; the task is to “tell…a story.”² The writer and the historian share this task of bestowing meaning—the art of interpretation: “The transformation of the given raw material of sheer happenings which the historian, like the fiction writer (a good novel is by no means a simple concoction or a figment<br>

  Abstract: Less than half a year before Russia’s relations with the United States were soured by the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Russian State Duma began a war of words about an issue of no apparent significance, although its subject was literally earth-shattering: the Hollywood blockbuster 
                  Armageddon, whose depiction of a Russian cosmonaut wearing a fur hat as he frantically repaired the decrepit Mir space station was perceived as an unforgivable insult to Russian national pride.

Clearly, the penetration of the Russian market has been a success. To make an analogy unlikely to grace the pages of a college entrance exam, Stryker’s member is to the Russian sex industry as Snickers is to snack foods: while both guarantee “satisfaction,” the organ is a naked demonstration of the barely hidden erotic connotations of post-Soviet Russia’s humiliating status as a weakened, passive importer of prepackaged cultural and<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: In
         Paradigms for a Metaphorology, originally published in 1960 and here made available for the first time in English translation, Hans Blumenberg (1920-1996) approaches these questions by examining the relationship between metaphors and concepts. Blumenberg argues for the existence of "absolute metaphors" that cannot be translated back into conceptual language. These metaphors answer the supposedly naïve, theoretically unanswerable questions whose relevance lies quite simply in the fact that they cannot be brushed aside, since we do not pose them ourselves but find them already posed in the ground of our existence. They leap into a void that concepts are unable to fill.<br>

  Abstract: In our investigations into truth metaphors, we have proceeded so far by placing 
                  longitudinal sections, or rather—to emphasize the deficiency of our material (which of course can only be measured against the inevitable deficiency of all historical material)—we have provided a series of points through which a curve may be drawn. Even if we disregard the factual density of the material offered in evidence, this procedure is as contestable as it is indispensable for the development of a metaphorology. But we want to illustrate what makes it contestable by seeking to satisfy the ideal postulate of a complementary<br>

  Book Title: Artifice and Design-Art and Technology in Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALLEN BARRY<br>
  Abstract: In an intriguing book about the aesthetics of technological objects and the relationship between technical and artistic accomplishment, Barry Allen develops the philosophical implications of a series of interrelated concepts-knowledge, artifact, design, tool, art, and technology-and uses them to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. This may be seen at the heart of
         Artifice and Designin Allen's discussion of seven bridges: he focuses at length on two New York bridges-the Hell Gate Bridge and the Bayonne Bridge-and makes use of original sources for insight into the designers' ideas about the aesthetic dimensions of their work. Allen starts from the conviction that art and technology must be treated together, as two aspects of a common, technical human nature.<br>

  Abstract: There are many books about art, many about technology, but few about art 
                     and technology—about their affinity and the relationship of both together to human experience.¹ It is this relationship that is my topic here. I develop philosophical concepts of art, artifact, knowledge, technology, and tool, which I use to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. The result is a work of interdisciplinary philosophical research, with concepts and arguments drawn from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, science studies, aesthetics, and the history, philosophy, and anthropology of art and technology.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v967">Artifice and Design</a><br>
  Abstract: The theory of tools and technical action is poorly developed in Western philosophy. There has been little advance over the ideas of Aristotle, which contain serious errors. Another source of misunderstanding is the “well-known fact” that lots of species use tools, especially chimpanzees. This chapter is partly a critique of prevailing ideas about tools and artifacts. I want to show the need for a new take on the basic concepts of technological civilization, including 
                  artifact, artifice, technique, and tool. One topic I will not be discussing is “modern” or advanced, scientific technology. I leave that to chapter 4. This chapter<br>

  Abstract: In common parlance the terms “historical interpretation” and “historical representation” are often used interchangeably. The historical text can alternatively be described as an “interpretation” or as a “representation of the past.” Nevertheless, the two terms do not have quite the same meaning. This is clear from the fact that language, either spoken or written, is the prototypical object of interpretation, whereas the object of representation is reality. Texts are interpreted, and landscapes or still lives are represented in paintings made of them. It makes no sense to speak of the “interpretation” of the landscape we see through the windows of<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapters it was argued that representation leaves no room for propositional truth. This raises the question whether this should be our last word about historical truth. Since historians themselves do not hesitate to apply the notion of truth to historical writing and since the practice of historical writing amply supports their confidence in historical truth, we cannot leave this issue undiscussed. Perhaps we can think of an alternative to propositional truth that agrees with the relevant facts about historical representation.¹<br>

  Book Title: Studies in Medievalism XXIV-Medievalism on the Margins<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: This volume not only defines medievalism's margins, as well as its role in marginalizing other fields, ideas, people, places, and events, but also provides tools and models for exploring those issues and indicates new subjects to which they might apply. The eight opening essays address the physical marginalizing of medievalism in annotated texts on medieval studies; the marginalism of oneself via medievalism; medievalism's dearth of ecotheory and religious studies; academia's paucity of pop medievalism; and the marginalization of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and literary characters in contemporary medievalism. The seven subsequent articles build on this foundation while discussing: the distancing of oneself (and others) during imaginary visits to the Middle Ages; lessons from the margins of Brazilian medievalism; mutual marginalization among factions of Spanish medieval studies; and medievalism in the marginalization of lower socio-economic classes in late-eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Spain, of modern gamers, of contemporary laborers, and of Alfred Austin, a late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poet also known as Alfred the Little. In thus investigating the margins of and marginalization via medievalism, the volume affirms their centrality to the field.

  Abstract: Today, the Middle Ages might be conveniently defined as the study of the events and artifacts in Europe (more or less) between 500 and 1500 (more or less) that still survive, and our interactions with them. Countless medieval acts of various kinds have been incorporated, and survive as what Bruno Latour has called “actants,” in our present institutions, artifacts, and gestures, but they are so combined with so many other actants that it is impossible to disentangle the medieval actants from the others, and meaningless to do so, since in these cases their value lies not in their historical difference,<br>

  Author(s) Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: In histories of German lyric poetry, Herder has no place. Also, his narrative and dramatic works are rarely mentioned in histories of German literature. It is true that he contributed in an extraordinary way to the evolution of a “new” poetry in the 1770s, but through theoretical stimulation rather than in his own creative practice. Herder started early to write poems, and cultivated the genre his entire life. The fact that he did not publish volumes of his own poetry seems to indicate his own doubts about its quality.

  Abstract: The above quotation, taken from a 1934 novel by Enid Dinnis, the main character of which is based loosely on the figure of Julian of Norwich, speaks volumes for the ‘industry’ of imaginative projection which Julian has become during the course of the last century or so. The very fact that this now obscure novel reached its sixth imprint in 1934 attests to its contemporary popularity and to a burgeoning fascination with Julian and the anchoritic life which she embraced. Since that time, Julian has become an increasingly familiar figure within both literary and non-literary circles, and both religious and<br>

  Abstract: Given the prominence of Julian of Norwich’s writing in the canon of English literature, it is surprising how little we know about her audience in general. Neither historical nor manuscript evidence reveals much about her contemporary audience. To determine who read or heard her work, either as a written or oral composition, we need to consider such questions as who Julian was, who wrote down her story in its short form and then in its longer and more considered version, for whom she intended these versions, and who actually received them. Despite the fact that these questions yield only fragmentary<br>

  Abstract: Historians of the modern and pre-modern worlds have often sought to make connections between the boundaries of states and the shape of their respective historiographies; in recent years they have scrutinised archival processes and the preservation of artefacts of the past, and they and their literary peers have examined the historical narratives which imposed order on the past and gave meaning to its remains.¹ National historiographies are thus commonly ascribed active properties, as means by which elites might recognise and realise a collective future for their nation, stifle opposing views and assert a common will.

  Book Title: Cultural Performances in Medieval France-Essays in Honor of Nancy Freeman Regalado<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Burns E. Jane<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays pays tribute to Nancy Freeman Regalado, a ground-breaking scholar in the field of medieval French literature whose research has always pushed beyond disciplinary boundaries. The articles in the volume reflect the depth and diversity of her scholarship, as well as her collaborations with literary critics, philologists, historians, art historians, musicologists, and vocalists - in France, England, and the United States. Inspired by her most recent work, these twenty-four essays are tied together by a single question, rich in ramifications: how does performance shape our understanding of medieval and pre-modern literature and culture, whether the nature of that performance is visual, linguistic, theatrical, musical, religious, didactic, socio-political, or editorial? The studies presented here invite us to look afresh at the interrelationship of audience, author, text, and artifact, to imagine new ways of conceptualizing the creation, transmission, and reception of medieval literature, music, and art.

  Author(s) Solterer Helen<br>
  Abstract: In the murky climate of Paris 1413, on a Mayday when king Charles VI had gone mad, noble factions were killing each other off, and the city in revolt, the major chroniclers focused on one episode. Each narrated the arrest of women attending the queen, Isabeau of Bavaria.¹ Jean Le Fèvre’s account presents a menacing break-in (75–79). A crowd of commoners, led by butchers known as the Cabochiens, penetrated the
                  Hôtel particulierof the dauphin demanding that he hand over all traitors in his residence. Next stop: the queen’s own Hôtel Saint-Pol where a roll-call of traitors was read<br>

  Abstract: Writing in 1982, the photographer and curator Janos Frecot claimed that “die Stunde Null in ihrer Offenheit scheint aktueller denn je” (the Zero Hour in its openness seems more urgently contemporary than ever).¹ If, given the manifold continuities in societal and political structures that followed the end of the war, particularly in West Germany, the caesura of the “Zero Hour” (or “Stunde Null”) is a myth rather than a historical fact, its value as the emblem of a missed opportunity was nevertheless something that was invoked, as here by Frecot, in attempting to imagine an alternative German society.

  Abstract: In the essay “Ruysdael als Dichter” (1816; Ruisdael as Poet), Johann Wolfgang Goethe argues that Jacob van Ruisdael’s images seem to move, and in fact to enact a narrative. Goethe notes that the seventeenth-century painter’s technique is impeccable, but the essay focuses on Ruisdael “as a thinking artist, even as a poet” (als denkenden Künstler, ja als Dichter).¹ “Ruysdael als Dichter” implicitly disputes the conclusions of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s
                  Laokoon(1766; Laocoon), which states that painting and sculpture can only imitate plots or narratives, not convey them.² Ruisdael, counters Goethe, indeed can portray movement through time in his painting: his<br>

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Author(s) Sikora Justin<br>
  Abstract: When considering community engagement at historic battlefields, there are no clear-cut, easily definable parameters as to who or which entities could be considered the sole ‘community’ at this kind of heritage site. One of the key reasons for this is that many battlefields do not have easily defined boundaries, resulting in confusion not only over who is responsible for their care and management but also over who values unidentified, and sometimes misidentified, spaces. Compounded by the fact that these are often empty fields devoid of even cursory manifestations of memorialisation, one could conclude that these are forgotten sites buried under<br>

  Author(s) Garloff Katja<br>
  Abstract: Kafka’s “A Report to an Academy” (“Ein Bericht für eine Akademie,” 1919) has often been read as a parody of Jewish assimilation into German culture, in part because it was first published in Martin Buber’s acclaimed Jewish monthly 
                  Der Jude. In this reading, the text would suggest a problematic convergence between racial antisemitism and a Zionistinspired critique of assimilation. The parable of the African ape that becomes an almost-human European intimates that biological differences set the Jews apart despite all their efforts at acculturation. The fact that “A Report” ends by describing the ape’s nightly encounters with a creature of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt1x732q">Interconnections</a><br>
  Author(s) May Vivian M.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars of intersectionality, historically and presently, start from the premise that both lived identities and structures of power and privilege should be understood as interwoven and not as additive factors or as separable dynamics. Intersectional approaches therefore entail a significant shift in epistemological, ontological, and methodological frames: fundamentally emphasizing simultaneity, scholars of intersectionality employ “tactics, strategies, and identities which historically have appeared to be mutually exclusive under modernist oppositional practices.” Because this alternative mode of reasoning can readily lead to charges of illogic, as Kimberlé Crenshaw has discussed at length, those who employ intersectionality frequently confront being misread or misunderstood.¹<br>

  Abstract: In 2003 I stood for nomination by the Democratic Party for the presidency of the United States. That this is a little-known fact doesn’t bother me much: it was a very personal exercise that I hoped then and believe now helped shape attitudes about the proper place to be occupied by women and people of color in American society. From that experience, and many others in my personal odyssey, I can say without reservation that in America, gender is more of a cultural barrier than is race.<br>

  Abstract: In the first chapter, I studied the various ways in which a narrator produces a magical realist effect in the text. One important point that emerged from the passages being analysed was the centrality of communal belief for adopting a perspective upon reality that is regarded as valid. Disbelievers are frowned upon while storytellers are seen to embellish and exaggerate their accounts on many occasions. The confusion that arises for the reader creates the impression that two points of view upon a given reality are battling with one another. In fact, there are frequent examples within both texts where events<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I examined the claims of Latin Americanists that magical realism emerged from their continent due to its unique history, geography and racial mixing. It was demonstrated, by the analysis of key passages in García Márquez’s novel and Ovid’s poem, that there are many factors that can explain the use of magical realism, ranging from political and cultural to literary traditions. In this chapter, I continue to examine the claims of Latin Americanists, in this instance, focusing upon the aesthetic effect of magical realism, rather than the reasons for its appearance.<br>

  Abstract: This volume investigates and illumines the German sixteenth century—the age of the Renaissance, Reformation, 
                  and Faust. Bringing old and new research together, this book structures its study of that era around the figure of Faust. The stories about him address a number of definitive issues for his century, in particular, the intersection of Renaissance humanism and Reformation theology, the practice of magic and diabolism, the interplay of fact and fantasy, the juxtaposition of good and evil (or of the spirit and the world), and the submission to or transgression of the moral code.

  Author(s) van der Laan J. M.<br>
  Abstract: For many reasons, we can consider the sixteenth century a Faustian age. One way to define the era in Faustian terms, and probably the most obvious, involves a particular individual, part fact perhaps, but almost entirely fiction, who emerges full blown in the sixteenth century and has been with us ever since as a dynamic figure laden with meaning. That person or character is Faust himself, who embodies the zeitgeist or spirit of the age. If we survey the century, we find that Faust receives more and more attention as the years go by and transforms from a cipher, from<br>

  Abstract: While God has certainly been one of the most important subjects of Western literature, the devil matches that popularity in a Manichaean-like symmetry. Indeed, the good and evil they incorporate are among the fundamental issues of literature. A detailed probing of the ways individual writers in any particular period reflected those polar opposites would be an inexhaustible undertaking. Nevertheless, we can observe a remarkable increase in the interest in, fascination with, and fear of the devil during the late Middle Ages and the early modern period. The increase is parallel to the growth of widespread superstition.¹ In fact, the curious<br>

  Book Title: Christians and Jews in Angevin England-The York Massacre of 1190, Narratives and Contexts<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

Thousands of ordinary people experienced profound changes, their life experiences and personal stories etched into their physical remains and threaded through the trappings of their death. The pressures of modern development mean that many recent burials are disinterred from their ‘final’ resting place and reburied elsewhere.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt5vj7vz">War and Literature</a><br>
  Author(s) WRIGHT TOM F.<br>
  Abstract: How does the role of public speech evolve in an age of technological transformation? Two literary and visual artefacts from the wars of nineteenth-century America pose this question, and offer insights into a chapter of media history that is still poorly understood. In the first, Richard Caton Woodville’s
                  War News From Mexico(1848), the ambivalent place of wartime voice takes centre stage. This most iconic of genre paintings records a foundational scene of US imperialism, and captures the public drama of national expansion. Its broader subject, however, is the social life of information. Woodville’s image depicts news of Mexican surrender<br>

  Does Tolstoy’s War and Peace Make Modern War Literature Redundant? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt5vj7vz">War and Literature</a><br>
  Author(s) RAWLINSON MARK<br>
  Abstract: The concept of redundancy employed in this essay is the one used in mathematics and linguistics to designate symbols that do not add information to a sequence. One of the hazards of teaching twentieth-century war literature is the tacit inference of redundancy by readers, namely that the representational conventions as well as the facts and values represented are ‘predictable from … context’.
                  90The claim that twentieth-century war writing is made superfluous byWar and Peace(1869) is polemical, but it is also intended to do serious work: to draw attention to representations of war which are not predictable from context,<br>

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81fsr">Love and Death in Goethe</a><br>
  Abstract: Goethe’s 
                  Faust expresses Romanticism’s agony over the fact of individuation and the individual’s distance from its origin and destiny. Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

  Abstract: In Quebec, the massive sociopolitical and cultural changes of the 1960s and the consolidation of the liberal État-providence in the 1970s saw a great overlap of culture and politics. The linkage was, in fact, so significant that in the 1980s, after the failure of the referendum for independence, many intellectuals and writers would reflect nostalgically on the previous two decades. They detected a general disengagement in the literature of the 1980s.

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers face social disapproval for spending too much time on activities that do not conform to socially prescribed gender roles—men are mocked by coworkers for taking paternity leave, while working mothers are chastised for leaving their children to the care of others. Fighting for Time challenges assumptions about the relationship between time and work, revealing that time is a fluid concept that derives its importance from cultural attitudes, social psychological processes, and the exercise of power. Its insight will be of interest to sociologists, economists, social psychologists, business leaders, and anyone interested in the work-life balance.<br>

  Abstract: Harrison White:In describing the fierce competition of the new German university system, Ben-David spoke of the fact that one of the things going for the experimentalists was, after all, that they were doing lab work, and he seemed to take it for granted that lab work was more communicable. I found that a fascinating puzzle because in my own experience, lab work is one of the least communicable things in the world. It is not at all easy to replicate experimental work or lab work. I would argue that the advantage of experimentalists is a paradox. You have to<br>

  Abstract: Large American manufacturing firms have widely adopted some form of decentralization or divisionalization in past decades (Chandler 1962; Vancil 1979; Haspeslagh 1983). Why? Our argument will be a crosssectional one; it explains, without depending on imitation or history, why decentralization makes sense here and now for current executives of large manufacturing firms. Our argument also is a structuralist one: For both the innovators and later adopters, divisionalization must be interpreted with special reference to the context of what the other firms in a sector of the economy were doing.<br>

  Abstract: Ever since the pioneering empirical work of Alfred Chandler, the investigation of multidivisional firms has been transforming our understanding of what organizations are and of how they operate. Williamson began the theoretical task by undermining the classical Weberian dichotomy between markets and hierarchies. Through his transaction cost analysis of contracting systems, Williamson underlined the fact that current business management is a mixture of market and hierarchy principles. Hybrid organizational forms such as diversification, profit centers, performance evaluation, transfer pricing, subcontracting, joint ventures, and conglomerates all point to the pervasiveness both of profit-oriented exchange relations within economic units and of overtly<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Abstract: Officially, I left the University of Texas for Paris in the summer of 1966 as a fulbright scholar. What I wanted in fact to learn was how to make a revolution—or at least to understand the Marxist theory that had been identified with this skill. I had taken part in the civil rights movement, and demonstrated against the war in Vietnam; but both of these movements seemed to be caught in the trap of using the language of liberalism against the liberal system.

The balcony scene on August 21, 1968, when Nicolae Ceauşescu, general secretary of the RCP, addressed a crowd of over 100,000 from the Central Committee building in one of Bucharest’s main squares and vehemently condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia a few hours after the Warsaw Pact intervention, a scene that became a national-communist legend, was eulogized by many as a gesture of heroic proportions: the Romanian david valiantly defying the Soviet Goliath. it was in fact nothing but a skillful masquerade, but it worked: a power-obsessed neo-Stalinist<br>

Levski’s biographer Stoianov also had never met Levski and suffered profoundly from this “deficiency.” His first attempt at biography (moving away from the memoirist genre) was Levski, and he was adamant that it was true to facticity and resisted the temptations<br>

Insofar as Stambolov had become a symbol of independent national policies, directed against Russia in particular, the newly restored democracy in Bulgaria marked its exit from the Soviet sphere of influence with this monument. The irony is that by vindicating Stambolov, in fact, by giving official sanction to a process that had begun already under communism,<br>

  Abstract: Trials against former leaders of a dictatorial regime are symbolic moments in the founding of a new political order. Beyond the classic functions of criminal justice (punishing the guilty, preventing similar deeds in the future and reinforcing respect for the law), these trials can also play an epistemic role in societies in transition.¹ They constitute important processes of narrative construction, understood as “storytelling” (
                  mise en récit) about injustice. The selection of the relevant facts at the trial, their legal characterization, and the assignation of blame by sentencing may constitute public affirmations of an official and normative version of events,² which<br>

This sense of protection pertains to divinely sanctioned exegeses, concerned with human origins and behaviour and in particular, with the Manichean distinction between good and evil, right and wrong. Orthodoxy as a signifier of collective representation, crystallises rules, symbols, behavioural inducements and consequences for actions, whose justification is also reflected in the internal necessities and functional core of the Serbian society.

  Abstract: Writing more than ten years hence, one cannot overstate the fact that 1989 represents a historical watershed of immense proportions. History either ended or began again. The defining twentieth-century struggle—between liberal democracies with their apparently superior market economies and authoritarian communist regimes with their ossifying and crumbling command economies—came to a sudden and unexpected demise. The former emperors of the Soviet Bloc were left shivering and cold in their newly-revealed nakedness; the vast political and security apparatus of the party-state crumbled like a house of cards.

First, Polish experiences are seen unique in the region: peculiar factors such as an institutionally strong and independent Catholic Church; the survival of private ownership of land and de-collectivization of agriculture; a history replete with both anti-Russian, anti-Soviet and working class uprisings (in 1831, 1863, 1944, 1956, 1970, 1976, and 1980–1981); the relative power and prowess of intellectuals and the intelligentsia; and the weakness of party-state institutions and elites (Schöpflin, 1983; Ekiert and Kubic, 2001).

This country's former status as superpower and the suspicious attitudes of the "reformed" elites toward every foreign project or initiative, as well as the resistance to Westernization traditional for this culture are among many factors that have imposed limits both theoretical and practical (or policy-making) on the neoliberal paradigm of democratization and modernization.

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: In the course of the book, no real convergence is achieved; each one ends where he started, asserting his own beliefs, visions, and concerns. Has anything been gained in the process? The intense and occasionally pointed dialogues bring forth an incremental, but substantial clarification of the issues at hand, the issues at stake, and their potential (but not actual) interaction. The fact of the matter is that neuroscience has no privileged bearing on human affairs simply because it deals with the brain. Why push it to realms in which it does not belong?<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”
            Theological Studies47 (1986): 44–45.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

Interestingly, this work also comes from a Columbia scholar, however much it is openly acknowledged to have derived largely from his experience at the New School for Social Research.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender. The international context thus suggested is obviously central to the half [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 59He explicitly recognizes the issue of intergroup relations, but he equally explicitly indicates that such is not his aim here.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic.

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M.

The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 450 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh between orthodoxy as the missionaries perceived it and African prophetic innova- tion were fluid and could be crossed in both directions, explaining the anxiety of white missionaries to bring Christianity back under control. In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 451 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne colonial worlds are apprehended and narrated?"43 I think this is a genuine point of tension for the Comaroffs, and quite rightly for many others. Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L. Comaroff, "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," Public Culture 12, no. 2 (2000): 334.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Mrozik,  Susanne<br>
Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: This book is a very original and important contribution to both the study of autobiography and that of historiography. In addition to his analysis of autobiographies of historians, Popkin gives new insights about the relationship between narrative and history. Maybe every historian should write an autobiography at some stage as an essential step in his or her professional development.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that Emily Dickinson’s poetry intervenes in the broad cultural assessment of epistemology provoked by the evolutionary debates of the 1860s. While scholars have begun to explore the thematic correspondences between Dickinson’s poetry and some aspects of this cultural conversation, this essay examines the ways in which her intervention occurs at the level of poetic form and is in fact profoundly dependent upon form. Specifically, it analyzes a set of her poems from the early 1860s through the early 1870s in which she uses the dual structure of metaphor to elicit a way of thinking about truth that is aligned with the empirical methods of research that were widely embraced in the mid nineteenth century; however, in the face of an increasingly contingent notion of truth, Dickinson’s way of thinking significantly revises cultural assumptions about what those methods might yield. The metaphors examined here amplify the distinctions between two material entities—lightning and fork, or sunset and lilac, for example—rather than merging them or leaping beyond them to stable, transcendent meaning. What Dickinson plays with is the possibility of a revised version of revelation or truth, one that is not only derived from the observation of material difference through the two parts of a metaphor, but that is more radically contingent on the perpetuity of such dual perception. Altogether, Dickinson’s metaphors are both critical and recuperative, as they contribute to the dismantling of fixed truth while embracing the limited revelations made possible by—
         onlymade possible by—sustained process.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:The fact that classical and early medieval allegorical personifications were exclusively female has long perplexed literary scholars and rhetoricians. Although arguments have been made about this gendering using grammatical formalism for the most part, an examination of rhetoric's own deep structure—that is, the discursive metaphors it has always employed to talkabouttropes and figures—promises to better articulate the gendered bases of the figure. Using analytical tactics drawn from Paul de Man's discussions of prosopopeia, this essay re-examines some of the rhetorical record along with programmatic imagery from patristic writings in order to demonstrate how women theinselves could serve as the "figures of figuration."<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts by Aboriginal groups to preserve and promote their culture are associated with dramatic reductions in rates of youth suicide. In the final study we show that different default strategies for resolving the paradox of personal persistence and change-Narrative and Essentialist strategies-distinctly characterize Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth.<br>

Abstract: The introduction of entrepreneurial education (EE) in the Israeli education system is discussed in this article as an example of the introduction of new curriculum. We argue that this introduction should be construed as a consequence of major ideological changes in Israel and its education system, a change from collectivist to individualistic values. We open with an analysis of a Ministry of Education publication that introduces the EE program and find that it is loaded with references to Zionist myths. We suggest that relying on references to these myths in promoting EE reflects a need to disguise the discontinuity between the social values behind the new curriculum and the traditional collectivist values of pioneering Zionism. We note that the Israeli programs exercise EE in groups, whereby the responsibility for the new ventures is shared by the group members. We suggest that adopting the group method indicates a compromise between a completely individualistic and competitive approach to entrepreneurship and a collectivist approach to coping with new tasks-which is more in line with traditional Zionist values. We argue that the change of atmosphere from collectivism to individualism is a result of demographic and economic processes that have occurred since the establishment of the Israeli state, and that these processes may be exposed through observing the Israeli youth movements and the public discourse. We believe that the gradual shift from collectivism to individualism is a central factor in explaining the timing of EE's introduction in Israel.<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Abstract: This article discusses how T. S. Eliot's long poem, Four Quartets, employs the thematics of time, self, and history in an autobiographical work of literature. The article approaches autobiography primarily as an intellectual concern, rather than as a factual account of the author's life, in examining a work that is difficult to subsume under available interpretive paradigms. The first part of the article emphasizes how Augustine's Confessions, when considered as a meditation on time and religious experience, illuminates the hermeneutics of Four Quartets. The second and central part of the article provides close readings of key passages in this poem, which inscribes Greek cosmology and medieval epic in a narrative of literary development and spiritual change. The third and concluding part of the article explores how the author's later poetry and criticism highlight major tendencies in twentieth-century literature and anticipate the postmodern interpretation of history. / تعالج هذه المقالة قصيدة ﺇﻟﻴﻮﺕ الطويلة أربع رباعيات من منطلق جديد وبالرجوع إلى تيمات الزمن والذات والتاريخ في السيرة الذاتية الأدبية٠ وتتعامل المقالة مع السيرة الذاتية لا باعتبارها سجلاﹰ لما جرى في حياة صاحبها من أحداث، بل ابعتبارها سجلاﹰ مضمراﹰ للتطور الذهني لكاتبها٠ يقوم الجزء الأول من المقالة بتوظيف البعد ﺍﻟﺘﺄﻣﻠﻲ في الزمن وفي التجربة الدينية كما ورد عند القديس أوغسطين في سيرته الذاتية الاعترافات، لإضاءة المدار التأويلي لقصيدة أربع رباعيات٠ ويقوم الجزء الثاني بتحليل مقاطع رئيسية في القصيدة، مبرزاﹰ ما تتضمنه وما تلوّح به من معتقدات كونية إغريقية وملاحم وسيطية٠ أما الجزء الثالث والأخير فيتوصل إلى أن ذهنية إليوت، بالإضافة إلى كونها تعكس التوجه العام للأدب في القرن العشرين، تمهد للتفسير ما بعد الحداثي للتاريخ٠<br>

Abstract: An attempt is made in this paper to arrive at a typology of teachers within the specific context of two forms of discourse, ideological and educational, which constitute a particular school in India. It is suggested that the mode of recruitment, the teachers' perspectives on and adaptations to the particular ideology and the role, and their commitment to the same are significant factors contributing to the shaping of a teacher typology. In this particular context, the teacher is thus both defined by and perpetuates the two forms of discourse in the school. The data on which this paper is based was collected in 1981 through the use of questionnaires, interviews (both structured and unstructured) and observation.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: The title of this essay comes from contemporary hermeneutics, a branch of philosophy devoted to interpretation. It refers to the domain between a human artifact and a beholder. Brought to architecture, this worldly concept implicitly questions the conventional role of the individual amidst historical works. It also offers a common ground on which products of architectural interpretation (performances or fictions) may begin to engage our normally independent territories of history and design. This essay examines the concept of the world in front of the work and speculates on its implications for architectural education. The illustrations portray interpretive projects by the author's students.<br>

Abstract: Hans Fallada has suffered from a poor political reputation affecting his position in the literary canon. Instead of straightening out this political and canonical maladjustment, the essay argues for Fallada's significance as a bad example for those looking for moral and political lessons in mid-century German letters. "Der Alpdruck", his 1947 novel about a Soviet-installed mayor, depicts his wrong-headedness, first, as the autobiographical protagonist fails to adopt a satisfactory affect toward postwar guilt and innocence, and second, as he eyes two would-be benefactors, fictional counterparts to Gottfried Benn and Johannes R. Becher, with a wily realism that serves as a foil to their cultural or political responsibility.<br>

Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important positive functions of its own) begets as an unfortunate byproduct this tendency to spin out a causal account of the first evil, with the conceptual confusion resulting from it.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first meaning. This event, really never-ending, is a basic condition of life; it stimulates the spirit in a posture of perpetual emergence.<br>

Abstract: The new scientific cosmology which has emerged over the past forty years seems to be forcing philosophers and theologians alike to rethink the traditional theistic conception of God in which God is pictured as a First Cause designer of the universe in favor of what Joseph Campbell more mystically calls an "immanent ground of being, transcendent of conceptualization." The central thrust of these reflections is that we encounter that "immanent ground of being" through the experience of wonder and awe. Since actual experience is involved, then a phenomenological description of exactly what it is in the new cosmology (and the universe) which induces such wonder is possible. The basic thesis is that we experience wonder in the face of the remarkable and transcendent (beyond finite predicates and understanding) coming-into-being of nature over twelve to fifteen billion years. Wonder is the human reaction to and appreciation for the astounding fact that nature and all of its parts actually are. It is; we are; such is the ineffable beyond in our midst.<br>

Abstract: In recent years a number of writers have defended and attacked various features of structural, or neo-realist theories of international politics. Few, however, have quarrelled with one of the most foundational features of neorealist theory: its assumptions about the nature of science and scientific theories. In this essay I assess the views of science underlying much neorelist theory, especially as they are articulated in the work of Kenneth Waltz. I argue not only that neorealist theories rest on assumptions about science and theory that have been questioned by postpositivist philosophers and historians of science, but also that the failure to consider the work of these writers yields theories of international politics that are deficient in several respects: they are "weak" theories in the sense that they cannot illuminate crucial features of international politics, they presuppose and sustain a narrow view of power and power relations, they reify practices and relations in the international arena and they offer little promise of producing the sort of "Copernican Revolution" for which Waltz called (or, more modestly, even a minimally satisfactory theory of international politics). In light of these shortcomings, I sketch an alternative approach to the study of international affairs, one that has been termed "prototype studies." I contend that such an approach provides scholars with a rigorous way of studying international politics, without being a theoretical science.<br>

Abstract: It has recently been claimed (1) that mental states such as beliefs are theoretical entities and (2) that they are therefore, in principle, subject to theoretical elimination if intentional psychology were to be supplanted by a psychology not employing mentalistic notions. Debate over these two issues is seriously hampered by the fact that the key terms 'theoretical' and 'belief' are ambiguous. This article argues that there is only one sense of 'theoretical' that is of use to the eliminativist, and in this sense some kinds of "belief" (dispositional states, infra-conscious states and the Freudian unconscious) are indeed "theoretical" and hence possible candidates for elimination, while others (consciously occurring thoughts like judgements and perceptual Gestalten) are not theoretical and hence not candidates for elimination.<br>

Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Abstract: In this article I consider "narrative mind reading," the practical capability of inferring the motives that precipitate and underlie the actions of others. Following Jerome Bruner, I argue that this everyday capacity depends on our ability to place action within unfolding narrative contexts. While Bruner has focused on narrative mind reading as a within-culture affair, I look to border situations that cross race and class lines where there is a strong presumption among participants that they do not, in fact, share a cultural framework. Instead, interactions often reinforce actors' perceptions of mutual misunderstanding and cultural difference. Drawing on a longitudinal study of African American families who have children with severe illnesses, I examine narrative mind reading and misreading in one mother's interactions with the clinicians who treat her child. I further explore how narrative misreadings are supported through chart notes and "familiar stranger" stories. The focus on miscommunication grounds a theory of the reproduction of cultural difference in interactive dynamics and brings Bruner's emphasis on narrative into dialogue with contemporary anthropology of cultural borderlands.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of being out of place and not quite right.<br>

Abstract: Unquestionable as history may seem, there are all the same quite different readings and disparate inferences despite the same series of facts. This goes to show that even professional historians can sometimes be overcome by meditations on past possibilities of bifurcations. As to "alternatives to actual history," is serves well to bear in mind that few are plausible, but that belief in a predeterminative universe of necessities would certainly be misplaced. Whereas some occurrences are clear-cut enough to make us understand which components would have had to be changed in order to get a different outcome, others are of such a high degree of complexity that attempts to imagine an alternative course and divergent results remain rather illusory: the examples of Midway (the former type) and the defeat of France in 1940 (intricately overdetermined) clearly show that it pays in any case, in defiance to all complexities, to consider past potential. It is prerequisite for choosing between future options in more reasonable and efficient ways than hitherto.<br>

Abstract: Drawing attention to the complex reciprocal relationship between commercialized leisure and commercial literature in the so-called "Age of Wit," this essay reconceives of the witty and witless in two important ways. Taking for granted, first of all, that wit is usually analyzed in terms of the efficacy of verbal language, the essay examines how and why debates concerning true and false wit were played out in physical terms—in this case, through the motions, gestures, and attitudes of the dancing body. Second of all, the essay attempts to account for the enduring, if unwitting, attractions of "false wit" by likening it to the tricks and transformations of contemporary English pantomime. Satirists of the 1720s, 1730s, and 1740s frequently invoke the unmeaning motion of Harlequin as a visual way of proscribing the verbal excesses of extravagant language. At the same time, apologists for pantomime associate Harlequin's "dumb Wit" with truth, reason, and the pattern of nature, claiming that the genre's corporeality allowed it to transcend the limitations and equivocations of words. The essay concludes that the popularity of pantomime contextualizes the Augustan reaction against false wit, in that it identifies a source of aesthetic pleasure in the public's eagerness to be duped by apparent sameness in difference. Early eighteenth-century readers enjoy luxuriant, illogical, and mixed metaphors, forced similes, and trifling jibes and quibbles for the same reason that early eighteenth-century spectators delight in the unexpected turns of pantomimic entertainment: in a world under the sway of Harlequin's magical slapstick, audiences derive satisfaction from being deceived.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a comparative study of the tributes paid to the American philosopher John Rawls, in France and the United States, after his death in November 2010. Whereas in the U.S. tributes to Rawls appeared in scholarly journals, in France they did in political magazines and general interest media. Besides, the focus in U.S. journals on Rawls's philosophical commitments is at odds with the emphasis placed by the French media on the political interpretations of his theory of justice. The contrast between Rawls's French and U.S. "funerals" is a consequence of the way intellectual fields in France and the U.S. differ in their relation to politics. While Rawls conformed with what was expected of him in the American academia by staying away from politics almost all his life, he was seen in France as an intellectuel engagé, the typical figure of intellectual life since the Dreyfus case. The contrast between the French and American reactions to Rawls's death is also related to the fact that those who first got interested in his theory of justice in France were supporters of the anti-totalitarian left or center-right, rather than academic philosophers.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Abstract: Death and futility are among a cluster of themes that closely track discussions of life's meaning. Moreover, futility is thought to supervene on naturalistic meta-narratives because of how they will end. While the nature of naturalistic meta-narrative endings is part of the explanation for concluding that such meta-narratives are cosmically or deeply futile, this explanation is truncated. I argue that the reason the nature of the ending is thought to be normatively important is first anchored in the fact that narrative ending qua ending is thought to be normatively important. Indeed, I think futility is often thought to characterize naturalistic meta-narratives because a narrative's ending has significant proleptic power to elicit a wide range of broadly normative human responses on, possibly, emotional, aesthetic, and moral levels towards the narrative as a whole.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mankind: The discovery of the unreality of man's existence apart from God, is the discovery at the same time of the fact that God is the ultimate ground of the unity of mankind. According to Jaspers the fact of life are to conform to the principle of that wider order of reality disclosed to us in the experience of communication in which the reality of each person's likeness to the image of God finds its practical application. The development of communication depends on the principle of correlation of Existenz and Transcendenz which is the property of no finite existential self, but manifests itself alike in all. Though we may be confronted with the question "Is it God or the devil who governs the world?", it remains equally true that even "failure is no argument against the truth that is rooted in transcendence". 3) Ultimate Dignity of Man: Jaspers' unequivocal emphasis on freedom, stating that "Freedom and God are inseparable" serves to assure this ideal its place in human society. Thus man's exercise of freedom knits him up into the transcendental design. The claim that certain facts and experiences yield a basis for the recognition of the ultimate dignity of man is justified precisely by this evidence that through God, as inseparable from freedom, we discern the ultimate significance of both man and humanity.<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in confusing motives with causes; irrationalism, which advocates a "liberté d'indifférence", basing itself on the same premise as rationalism, and confusing motives with causes, is wrong in seeing the negation of the very existence of motives as the one way of saving human freedom. Both views disregard the fact that human action is impossible and cannot be understood without motives and that this, in turn, does not mean a determination of man in a mechanical way, for motives are not a part of nature but rather an organic element in a specific human situation—voluntary action. Human freedom is the freedom peculiar to a finite being immersed in time. Both those who stress passivity and receptivity and those who stress the dynamic creating ability of the self are wrong; both those who thought that freedom is possible only on the basis of clear and distinct motives and that action is nothing but the end of deliberation (St. Thomas) and those who thought that freedom is possible only by an irrational emergence of the vital ego (Bergson) or by negating the existence of any previous determination of the self (Sartre) are mistaken. A true human decision is composed of two elements; given motives and values on the one hand, and non-intellectualist spontaneous choice on the other. Duality is peculiar to human action. This is made more explicit in dealing with the more fundamental involuntary elements; character, sub-consciousness and life. Man acts freely from a finite and determined point of view; he acts in a clear and transparent way on the basis of confused and amorphous data; he lives his freedom when thrown into life. Necessity is inherent in man; it is one of his modes of being. There is no "inner freedom" on the one hand and "objective" causal necessity on the other. This conception of human action as both activity and passivity is reminiscent of Merleau-Ponty's statement in his "Philosophie du perception": "Le monde est déjá constitué, mais aussi jamais complètement constitué.... Il n'y a donc jamais déterminisme et jamais choix absolu, jamais je ne suis chose et jamais conscience nue". There is no dilemna between determinism and irrationalism, just as there is none between extended substance and thinking substance; there is dialogue.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: "La dérive d'une vie," that of the hero in En rade, is metaphorized by the dérive of narrative, composed of a complex network of metaphors. In 1893, Paul Souriau proposed that metaphor makes a fleeting representation pass into the unconscious. Dreams and hysteria, states in which the unconscious holds sway, are of considerable importance in this text. An analysis of the way that metaphor works will shed light on the relationships between dream and reality, and between consciousness and the unconscious in general. The double fil of extended metaphor is also metaphorized as a bifurcating road, the road of narrative and the labyrinthine path the hero's thoughts take. In fact, route or chemin is not only a metaphor for the text and for extended metaphor itself, but also for the complex pathways of the nerves and brain. If the road or path of narrative is also a representation of nerves/brain, then retracing these pathways of metaphors would be a way of following the text's attempt to dissect the brain and uncover the links between dream and reality, the double sphere of activity that characterizes this novel.<br>

Abstract: This paper, a reply to Professor R. S. Downie's criticisms of our paper 'A Political Critique of Kantian Ethics in Social Work', both appearing in BJSW 19, 6, tries to answer the main charge against us of illegitimately bridging the logical gap between statements of value and statements of fact. In addition to this, we explicate further our original arguments that language and power are indissolubly bound to each other, and that a Kantian approach to social work theory and practice fails in trying to dissolve that relationship by finding a neutral, universal ground from which to derive ethical principles and judgements.<br>

Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that a religious perspective on South African writing (the term is defined as including any cultural artefact, spoken or written, which uses language(s) as its main means of communication) is both fruitful and long overdue. The essay traces, or outlines, the general situation and lists some areas in which religious concerns, such as transformation, suffering and hope, poverty and marginality, can contribute to debates on South African writing. Some of these are further discussed.<br>

Abstract: Responding to the ethical and performative call of Judith Butler not to propagate the sex- and gender-related violence of the imbedded discourse that we study, this article inquires into the discursive strategies of Jewish scripture by analysing how it orchestrates certain norms of sex and gender and makes them serve the overall aim of securing cultural survival. Following this, it traces reflections on persons of ambiguous or indeterminate sex from rabbinic to modern Judaism so as to inquire into the rabbinic dependency on scripture when non-conforming individuals challenge its bipolar sex and gender system. Finally, the article considers if scripture, as suggested by Butler, can play a subversive role in how we attend to non-conforming others today. To do so, the author's distinction between hermeneutical and artifactual uses of scripture is presented to evaluate the extent to which modern Jews and non-Jews are able to influence their own representations of sex and gender and thus liberate themselves from the normativity implied by scriptural discourse.<br>

Abstract: The article of M. Lilla marks the political position of Derrida in the context of French philosophy since Sartre. Presenting him as an engaged opponent of existentialism and structuralism Lilla shows that Derrida's vehement philosophical fight is directed fundamentally against what he calls the logocentrism of all western philosophy. Derrida's only remedy against this disease: deconstruction of the language. In applying this recipe himself, Derrida ends at a somewhat mysterious one and only notion, the concept of justice, which according to him is not destructible and should not be destructed. The provocative explanation Lilla gives for the surprising fact, that Derrida's most fervent adherents live in the United States is the unlimited self-confidence and good nature of the Americans.<br>

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the influence of the Gospel of John on Joyce's aesthetic. My basic claim is that the gospel aided Joyce in charting a middle course between materialism (body without spirit) and spiritualism (spirit without body). After examining the temptations of flying too high (symbolism, mysticism, gnosticism) and flying too low (historicism, realism, materialism), I show how Joyce made use of the Johannine strategies of epiphany and realized eschatology to achieve a synthesis between these extremes. The essay is much indebted to two students of John—Rudolph Bultmann and Franz Mussner—who examined John's peculiar synthesis of fact and allegory. In addition, the scholar Jacques Aubert was indispensable for his analysis of a similar trajectory in Joyce's aesthetic.<br>

take the reins, since Nala is driving; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 232-33. As men-
tioned in n. 7 above, J. Brockington finds this "implausible." For valuable discus-
sion of the "avatära" theme in both epics, and especially in the Rämäyam, see

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: The main aim of this article is to offer a critical reflection on the need of rethinking the teachers' professional skills and their academic pathway, given the changes and current transformations (crisis, in its etymological sense). In fact, a series of changes, transformations, are identified and affect directly the educator's comprehension. Amongst others: the transformation of work bound up with the processes of the economic globalization, and the transformation of the learning environments imbued by the TICs; the population growth, a demographic transformation with geopolitics relevance, and finally, as a result from the previous ones, the raise in the migratory flows. Under this context, this paper tries to reconceptualize teachers' training and their depiction as professionals from the view of Gustav Mahler in his statement Tradition is the spreading of fire and not the veneration of ashes. Thereupon, some categories that help in the teaching update, are proposed and explained; such as authority (as reputation or moral authority, role model and, hence, less so as bare exercise of power), the personalization of education, the importance of home community (society), and, lastly, the alternation within school-society and work-study. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una reflexión acerca de la necesidad de re-pensar la profesionalidad de los docentes y de su itinerario formativo, a la luz los cambios y transformaciones actuales (crisis, en sentido etimológico). En efecto, se identifican una serie de cambios, de transformaciones, que afectan directamente a la comprensión del docente, del enseñante. Entre otros: la transformación del trabajo vinculada a los procesos de la globalización económica y la transformación de los entornos de aprendizaje imbuidos en las TICs; el aumento de la población, la transformación demográfica con trascendencia geopolítica; y por último, y como confluencia de las dos anteriores, el aumento de los flujos migratorios. En este contexto, el trabajo trata de reconceptualizar la formación de los profesores y de su imagen como profesionales desde el enfoque que era expresado por Gustav Mahler en la frase la tradición es el mantenimiento del fuego y no la adoración de sus cenizas. Así, se proponen y se explican algunas categorías que ayudan a la actualización de la docencia hoy, tales como: la autoridad (como prestigio o autoridad moral, ejemplo, y no tanto como mero ejercicio del poder), la personalización de la enseñanza, la trascendencia de la comunidad de origen (a la sociedad) y por último, la alternancia entre escuela y sociedad, trabajo y estudio.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines how activists in rural southern India have sought to reshape the field of political communication by encouraging lower-caste women to submit written, signed petitions to district-level government offices, and so represent themselves to the state. I argue that contradictions between democratic recognition and the will to development that inhere to the political structure of contemporary governance in rural India correspond to tensions within the semiotic structure of signature itself, between constative representation and performative creation. Governmentality and the forms of communication that it requires often rest on the notion that written self-representation constitutes an act of political agency. But the limits of a governmental communicative reason that would conflate written subject and agent become especially clear in postcolonial contexts where the construction of those citizens that would be represented is in fact a product of the very act of representation. It is the narrative of development-as-pedagogy that holds out the promise of a future alignment of communicative frameworks, technologies, and participant roles, allowing for the transparent self-representation of an already-constituted citizen. By tracking the ambivalent experience of one group of women in particular, this account focuses on how the logic of signature as self-representation has served to recontextualize the marginality of petitioners as something within the state's broader field of power.<br>

Abstract: On peut noter que Jean-Francois Billeter etablit une distinction generale entre les
deux systemes de pensee, grecque et chinoise, qui recoupe, dans ses grandes lignes, celle
exposee par Jullien: "On peut apercevoir [...], me semble-t-il, une difference fondamen-
tale entre la pensee grecque et la tradition intellectuelle qui en est issue d'une part, et
l'ensemble (ou presque) de la pensee chinoise de l'autre. Notre tradition intellectuelle a
eu tendance a privilegier la conscience thetique et la conscience reflechie, qui font toutes
deux abstraction du mouvement, du changement, des transformations dans lesquels nous
sommes continuellement pris dans les faits. [...] La philosophie a par consequent eu dans
notre civilisation une vocation "theorique," contemplative. La pensee chinoise me parait
avoir ete, dans l'ensemble, beaucoup plus fidele aux donnees de lexperience commune, au
rapport spontane que nous entretenons avec nous-memes et avec les choses dans le cours
de nos activites. Elle a donne la priorite aux formes que notre vie consciente prend lorsque
nous nous mouvons, que nous agissons, etc., et a celles que la realite a pour nous dans ces
moments-la" ("Comment lire Wang Fuzhi?" 111-12).<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo está dedicado a todos los que, como Maximilian M. Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Abstract: This paper places the problem of child abuse in the perspective of evil. In so doing it calls into question the amoral assumptions of social science and human services. The current social science paradigm paradoxically dismisses evil as a real factor in the world, despite its concern for indisputably moral issues such as child abuse. The practical advantages of a perspective incorporating evil are several. Among them are a more realistic appreciation of the need for mechanisms of social control in preventing abuse, the role of confession and conversion, and the role of pastoral care as a support system for families.<br>

Abstract: The recollections of elderly men of work in a time of full employment are the focus of this paper. It is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with men who were young parents in the mid-1950s. Drawing on literature about masculinity, post-war Fordism and the constitution of self-identity through narrative, it explores their themes of how central security was to their identity as providers, and examines what satisfactions they got from working. The narrative bookends of their experience are strong memories of their parents in the Depression, and acute awareness of the contemporary insecurity of their children and grandchildren.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with an exemplary case study, this paper diagnoses and analyses some important strategies of evasion and factors of hindrance that are met in the teaching of medical ethics to undergraduate medical students. Some of these inhibitions are inherent to ethical theories; others are connected with the nature of medicine or cultural trends. It is argued that in order to avoid an attitude of evasion in medical ethics teaching, a philosophical theory of emotions is needed that is able to clarify on a conceptual level the ethical importance of emotions. An approach is proposed with the help of the emotion theory Martha Nussbaum works out in her book Upheavals of thought. The paper ends with some practical recommendations.<br>

Abstract: Habría que insistir en los efectos nada beneficiosos que se derivan de la forma de finan-
ciar muchas de esas becas: los proyectos de investigación tienen que ceñirse –obligados por
la convocatoria– a la historia de la localidad o región en la que se solicitan. Por no extender-
nos en el carácter tan alejado de los criterios científicos que suponen las pruebas de pureza
de vecindad, por las que un alicantino que resida en Alicante, por ejemplo, tiene francamen-
te difícil acceder a una beca del gobierno aragonés (aunque siempre se le podría decir, como
consuelo, que a un aragonés tampoco se la darían en Alicante).<br>

Abstract: En Los amantes del Círculo Polar de Julio Medem (1998) la relación entre Otto y Ana es punto de partida, origen, momento de apertura a un otro para hacer frente a los vacíos cada vez más pronunciados del vivir. Si es una relación utópica es porque se sitúa más allá de la realidad, es decir, de las condiciones de realidad positivas de los personajes. Éstos reclaman un momento de totalidad, un momento que, aun sabiéndose efímero, no se quiere tal. Los personajes niegan la realidad de lo que se les presenta – el dolor en sus vidas: la muerte del padre de Ana, la separación de sus padres y posterior muerte de la madre de Otto – porque les deja sin referencialidad a la cual seguir aferrándose para vivir sin miedo a la muerte, para vivir sin miedo la vida. Sin embargo, no están dispuestos ni a dejarse anular ni a renunciar a momentos de plenitud. Sobre si ello es factible, sobre si es posible en este mundo burlar de alguna manera a la muerte e instalarse aunque sea precariamente en la felicidad conseguida con el amor, trata este artículo.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we argue that archaeologists and anthropologists should be aware of forces that encourage the separation of archaeology from anthropology. Sociological, organizational, and intellectual factors that do not necessarily have disciplinary separation as their logical consequence can nonetheless have a cumulative effect that moves the relationship between the subfields of anthropology in the direction of greater or lesser independence. We compare the relative strength of certain factors that could either encourage or discourage the perpetuation of four-field anthropology in Canada and the United States.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Grounded theory's popularity persists after three decades of broad-ranging critique. In this article three problematic notions are discussed-'theory,' 'ground' and 'discovery'-which linger in the continuing use and development of grounded theory procedures. It is argued that far from providing the epistemic security promised by grounded theory, these notions-embodied in continuing reinventions of grounded theory-constrain and distort qualitative inquiry, and that what is contrived is not in fact theory in any meaningful sense, that 'ground' is a misnomer when talking about interpretation and that what ultimately materializes following grounded theory procedures is less like discovery and more akin to invention. The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but educational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and reflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.<br>

Abstract: The paper begins with a clarification of the terms 'effective' versus 'successful' teacher and their implications. There follows a summary of the results of a study addressing the issues: a) which Careers Education and Guidance (CEG) aims in Greece are considered most important, and b) what constitutes a successful careers teacher. The study is based on the responses of careers coordinators in Greece and consultants at the Greek Pedagogical Institute. Issues concerning Information and Self-Awareness as Careers Education and Guidance aims are discussed, and an alternative approach to Information is suggested. The main emphasis is placed on the importance of the teacher as an indispensable factor for the implementation of CEG aims in particular, and educational aims in general. /// Der Artikel beginnt mit der Klärung der Begriffe "effektive" gegen "erfolgreiche" Lehrer und deren Bedeutung. Es folgt eine Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse einer Studieüber die Themen: a) welche Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden in Griechenland als wichtig angesehen und b) was macht einen in der Berufsberatung erfolgreichen Lehrer aus. Die. Studie basiert auf den Antworten derer, die die Berufsberatung in Griechenland koordinieren sowie der Berater im Griechischen Pädagogischen Institut. Streitfragen über Information und Selbsterkenntnis als Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden diskutiert, und ein alternativer Ansatz zu Information vorgeschlagen. Das Hauptgewicht wird vor allem auf die Bedeutung des Lehrers als unersetzlicher Faktor für die Durchsetzung der Ziele von Berufsberatung und -lenkung im besonderen und die erzieherischen Ziele im allgemeinen gelegt. /// Le présent article commence par une clarification des termes "efficacité" et "succès" de l'enseignant et de leurs implications. On présente ensuite un résumé des résultats d'une étude portant sur les questions suivantes: a) quels sont les objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles considérés comme les plus importants en Grèce, et b) qu'est-ce qui contribue au succès d'un professeur d'enseignement professionnel. Cette étude se fonde sur les réponses des coordinateurs de l'enseignement professionnel en Grèce et des consultants à l'Institut pédagogique grec. On discute des questions concernant l'information et la conscience de soi comme objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles, et l'on suggère une nouvelle approche de l'information. L'accent majeur est mis sur l'importance de l'enseignant en tant que facteur indispensable à la réalisation des objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles en particulier, et des objectifs éducatifs en général.<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Abstract: Concerns with how cultural factors influenced agrarian social change remained an abiding interest in the work of James Scott. I begin by sketching out the context of debates in Marxist theory, development studies, and social and political anthropology that, during the 1980s, turned to relations between ideas, power, and processes of conflict and change in a world of new postcolonial nations and rapid agrarian development. In the article, then, I carefully examine the ideas Scott developed about resistance and hegemony in conversation with the work of E. P. Thompson. Tracing the genealogy of Scott's ideas about hegemony and rural social protest, I comment in some detail on the literature on resistance that arose in anthropology during the 1980s and the role of Scott's "Weapons of the Weak" (1985) in shaping that literature while interacting with "Subaltern Studies" (Guha 1982-87), studies of social movements, and examinations of power in interpersonal relations.<br>

Abstract: What is the connection between modern democratic thought and globalization? This article examines the rationale behind the present crisis of democracy. It demonstrates that the problem facing modern democratic thought has less to do with the asymmetries associated with the forces of globalization and more to do with an asymmetry within popular sovereignty itself: the fact that the boundaries of democracy cannot themselves be democratically legitimated. By making this argument the article seeks to move beyond the contemporary opposition between nationalism and cosmopolitanism. It shows that the appeal to globalization among contemporary political theorists to a large extent is analogous to the appeal to the nation during the French Revolution.<br>

Abstract: Recent work on conventional metaphor together with reinterpretations of classic studies of "soul substance" and mana are examined to assess the dangers of overinterpretation--the attribution of nonexistent theologies and metaphysics--by ethnographers. In our project of cultural translation, are we prone to attribute deeper salience to other peoples' way of talk than they in fact imply?<br>

Abstract: Assessing the limits of evolutionary and cognitive approaches to the study of culture goes to the heart of an issue that tends to divide humanists and scientists. The issue is how far, in dealing with complex cultural texts and the complex transactions we perform as readers, can we advance by scientific reduction? The issue is vexed by the fact that at times the complexity and novelty of humanistic discourse is little more than obfuscation and strained ingenuity. But such failings discredit neither the search for novelty, nor the earned perception of irreducible complexity, nor the immense importance of work that is necessarily, and terminally, speculative.<br>

Abstract: The collection of essays under review is the most innovative attempt thus far to expain the decline of fertility in Europe. Of particular interest is the frequent mention of culture as a prominent factor in such explanations. The review suggests that while this collection is significant in higlighting its importance, bringing culture into population history may require a rethinking of the metanarratives and metaphors in which that history is cast.<br>

Author(s): Cahill Lisa Sowle<br>
Abstract: Roman Catholic social ethics traditionally has affirmed moral objectivity, universal moral goods, and progressive social reform - premises that guide just war theory. In recent decades these guiding values have been challenged by contemporary critical philosophies, confessional or communitarian religious ethics, and the fact of cultural pluralism. I A the middle of this century, thinkers like John Courtney Murray gave Catholic ethics a more historical turn, while retaining an essentially realist and meliorist approach to morality and politics. Now this confidence and optimism are questioned anew by ethnopolitical violence, the ambiguities of humanitar- ian intervention, and uncertain attempts at reconciliation and restoration. Such developments show that the central quandary of Christian and po- litical ethics is not the achievement of agreement on basic human goods; it is the expansion of the circle of solidarity in which basic goods are shared in practice. I will suggest that Christian symbols can help evoke the sense of human solidarity that is necessary to sustain peace, and that transformative efforts toward peace in violence-torn societies can be successful.<br>

Abstract: Erik Erikson's work in psychosocial developmental theory has made valuable contributions to the field of religious ethics on some very basic issues. This paper makes scattered elements of Erikson's explicit ethical perspective available in concise fashion for critical ethical reflection. It does this in such a way as to highlight the centrally important fact for religious ethics that implicitly operative in Erikson's view is a criterion of "self-transcendence" as definitive of mature personal (fully human, ethical) development.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order. In specifíc terms, it attempts to explain the fact that the most important items of news that appear in the media are news of horror, in other words, news in which death always appears in the foreground. The news programmes of the media express and encourage the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies. However, in order to understand this culture, we must first establish the emotional nature of horror and also establish a sociological definition of this feeling. Horror is a complex emotion made up of feelings of terror, disgust and shock. Sociologically speaking, horror can be understood as "the emotion through which a social order indicates its outermost limits". The study concludes showing that there are two alternative ways of maintaining order and cohesión within the bosom of a social system. The first method of legitimation, which is characteristic of centripetal societies, works through the great power of attraction it exerts over the social field of a central nucleus of positive social values. The second, which is characteristic of centrifugal societies, works through the great power of repulsion exerted by flagrant transgressions of moral order over the social field. The typical method in which centrifugal societies regulate social order explains the culture of horror that is characteristic of our advanced societies.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole, but the focus of sympathy and concern, in a manner that demands their good should also be an object of moral consideration.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: Since its first publication, A Costa dos Murmúrios has attracted the critics' attention to the paradox of the explicit denial of its own authority over the historical facts that are part of the narration and its implicit, if qualified, affirmation of the same authority. This article also focuses on the sort of subliminal tension but from the angle of the literary construction of emotions, rather than examining either the poetics of historiographic metafiction or the role of memory in the narration of the past. Analyzing various aspects of A Costa dos Murmúrios (such as the predominant points of view, the structure of the narrative, the disintegration of the characters' identities, the emotional impact of a few vivid scences, the personalization of national events), a case is made for reading this novel as an intimate chronicle of historical facts.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii. Purtînd mǎrcile subiecti viaţii naratorului şi a unei ideologii personale aceste texte sunt în acelaşţi timp naraţiuni şi o formǎ de a depune mǎrturie. Ele dezvoltǎ deci o retoricǎ specialǎ prin care faptul trǎit se transformǎ în fapt povestit şi se comunicǎ unui interlocutor. Analia acestei retorici necesitǎ cunoaşterea discursurilor prin care evenimentul ne parvine, a condiţiilor în care s-a desfǎşurat ancheta, compararea povestirilor între ele pentru a constata apropierile diferenþele şi mai ales diferitele tipuri de focalizǎri. Acestea din urmǎ ne permit sa sesizǎm ce e mai important pentru cel ce povesteşte şi de ce. Pentru a ilustra aceasta problematicǎ ne-am oprit la tema identitǎţii şi alţeritǎţii, încercînd sǎ urmǎrim constelatiile idéologice şi culturale sub semnul cǎrora stau expansiunile ei in texte, criteriile prin care Celǎlalt este identificat şi prezentat. Through the study of the life stories told by the Romanian peasants of Banat and Oltenie, who were deported during the 1950s to the plain of Baragan, this article attempts to show how such biographical accounts can serve to reveal an ethno-historical and anthropological reality.We begin by underlining the methodological problems that such studies pose for the researcher. We discuss the discursive status of these accounts as a discourse intended to bear witness and the implications of this status for an analysis as a narrative and argumentative text, generating its own specific rhetoric. Along with an account of how this oral enquiry was carried out, it also seemed necessary to give a description of the historical context to which these accounts refer, in order to draw attention to the theme of identity and difference in the accounts given. The analysis of this theme required that due attention be paid do the ideological and symbolic constellations that surround it, in the criteria that the peasants use to differentiate the Other, in his or her multifarious guises. The examination of these factors offers several interesting lines of enquiry on cultural practices and mentalities, and on those in particular which relate to the household, the family and culinary habits. Indem wir die Lebensgeschichten der rumänischen Bauern aus Banat und Oltenie studierten, die in den fünfziger Jahren in die Ebene von Baragan vertrieben wurden, versuchten wir, herauszustellen, wie die Lebensgeschichte eine volksgeschichtliche und anthropologische Wirklichkeit ans Licht stellen kann. Wir haben das methodologische Problem betont, die sich für den Forscher aus derartigen Studie ergibt. Zuerst haben wir den erzählerischen Status der Lebenserzählung als Zeugnisrede erörtert, sowohl als auch die Folgen, die sich daraus ergeben, wenn sie als erzählender und argumentierender Text analysiert werden soll, der eine spezifische Rhetorik entwickelt. Eine Schilderung des historischen Zusammenhangs, worauf sich die Texte beziehen, und der Umstände, unter denen die mündliche Befragung sich abspielte, kam uns als notwendig vor, um die Bedeutung des Themas der Identität und des Unterschieds in den Erzählungen unserer Gesprächspartner hervorzuheben. In der Analyse dieses Themas nahmen wir die ideologischen und symbolischen Konstellationen in Kauf, die in den Textstellen vorherrschend sind, wo die Kriterien dargelegt werden, die die Bauern benutzen, um sich von dem Anderen unter seinen verschiedenen Gesichten zu unterscheiden. Die Analyse dieser Faktoren legt uns interessante Forschungswege nahe, die es erlauben, manche Denkweisen und kulturelle Verhaltensweisen herauszuheben, und zwar insbesondere diejenigen, die mit dem Heim -, Familienleben und Kochsitten verbunden sind.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience professionnelle et humaine de Giovanni Falcone, le juge instructeur du plus spectaculaire procès intenté contre la mafia, nous amène à examiner les relations entre l'enquête judiciaire et l'enquête ethnographique : car c'est grâce à l'instruction du Maxiprocesso (1986) qu'aujourd'hui nous disposons d'une abondante moisson de données sur Cosa Nostra, son fonctionnement, ses règles internes et son code d'honneur. Si la reconstruction d'une vérité au moyen d'indices, dans un monde protégé par l'omertà, apparente les techniques d'investigation du juge au modèle épistémologique qui est au fondement des sciences humaines depuis le XIXe siècle, l'utilisation d'informateurs appartenant à l'univers mafieux — les repentis — est à mettre en parallèle plus directement avec les méthodes de l'ethnographie. The human and professional experience of Giovanni Falcone, the examining magistrate in the most spectacular legal operation launched against the Mafia, makes us examine the relations between the judicial and the ethnographic investigation, for it is due to the inquiries of the Maxiprocesso (1986) that we now possess an abundant source of data on the Cosa Nostra, its operation, its internal rules and its code of honour. While, in a world protected by the omertà, the re-establishment of facts by means of evidence places the investigative techniques of the judge among those of the epistemological model, basis of the human sciences since the 19th century, the use of informers — the pentiti — from the world of the Mafia, on the other hand, reflects more directly the methods of ethnography. Das berufliche und menschliche Erfahrenheit des Untersuchungsrichters Giovanni Falcone im spektakulärsten aller jemals gegen die Mafia durchgeführten Prozesse führt uns zu einer Überprüfung der Beziehungen zwischen gerichtlicher und ethnographischer Untersuchung, denn dank der Voruntersuchung im Maxiprocesso (1986) verfügen wir heute über eine umfangreiche Sammlung von Angaben über die Cosa Nostra, über ihre Arbeitsweise, ihre inneren Regeln und ihren Ehrenkodex. In einer durch die Omertà geschützten Welt gleicht die Vorgehensweise des Richters bei der Aufdeckung der Wahrheit dem epistemologischen Modell, das den Humanwissenschaften seit dem 19. Jahrhundert zugrunde liegt, während die Verwendung von Informanten aus dem Bereiche der Mafia — den Pentiti — sich eher mit den Methoden der Ethnographie vergleichen lässt.<br>

Abstract: Le Tessin représente l'unique canton de la Suisse à grande majorité italophone. La construction de l'identité se base essentiellement sur la notion d'« italianité » et sur celle de « helvétidté ». Il s'agit en réalité d'une « double appartenance », et l'article analyse les différents modes de production sociale de l'ambivalence au plan des discours (historiques, linguistiques, folkloriques, politiques, rituels et visuels) et des pratiques sociales correspondantes. The canton Ticino is the unique Swiss canton with Italian-speaking majority. The construction of identity is based essentially on che notions of « italianity » and « swissness » which reveal in fact a « multiple belonging » to Italy and Switzerland. The article analyzes social production of ambivalence in historical, linguistic, folkloric, political, ritual and visual discourses and the corresponding social practices. Der Kanton Tessin ist der einzige Kanton mit italienisch-sprenchender Mehrheit. Die Konstruktion der nationalen Identität beruht hauptsächlich auf den Begriffen von « italianità » und « patria svizzera », was eine multiple italienische und schweizerische Angehörigkeit andeutet. Der Artikel analysiert die verschiedenen Modi von Sozialer Produktion von Ambivalenz in historischen, linguistischen politischen, ritualen und visualen Diskursen und der entsprechenden sozialen Praktiken.<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken und Eisen- und Stahlindustrie) geht zu Ende. Der Autor vergleicht das jüngste Ereignis, die spektakuläre Schliessung der letzten Kohlenbergwerks, mit der Inszenierung des letzten Giessens einer lothringischen Eisenhütte zehn Jare früher und fragt sich über die patrimonialen Finalitäten solcher Zelebrationen. Er zeigt einige Zeitpunkte der kulturellen Behandlung der lothringischen industriellen Krise (bezüglich des Erbes und Gedächtnisses), von den photographischen Symptomen eines verhinderten Gedächtnisses über die industriellen Resten, die nun unter dem Denkmalschutz stehen, was sehr umstritten wird, bis hin zu dem höchst « kontrollierten » Museum. In diesem Kontext hebt er die Kämpfe hervor, die um die Repräsentationen der Konstruktion des « industriellen » Lothringens als ein patrimoniales (abstraktes oder konkretes) « Grenzobjekt » entstanden, das sich mehrere Akteure nach Belieben aneignen können. Das Ziel dieser Artikel ist, zu einer politischen Anthropologie der Gedächtnisinstitution einen Beitrag zu leisten.<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine le concept de la performativité du don dans une communauté côtière ethniquement diversifiée, composée majoritairement d'autochtones sames et de Norvégiens. Inspirée par Mauss puis par Ricœur, l'auteure avance l'idée que la pratique du don revêt une importance capitale dans ces territoires isolés et peut être vue comme facteur d'émergence d'un sentiment de communauté et d'identité. Le don devient un acte performatif de relations et d'ethnicité, et une manière d'aborder la situation postcoloniale dans la région. This article addresses the performativity of the gift in an ethnically mixed coastal community, the population being predominantly indigenous Saami and Norwegian. Taking inspiration from Mauss and later Ricœur, my argument is that giving is highly important in these remote areas and can be seen as a way of creating community as well as identity. The gift becomes an act of performing relations as well as ethnicity and a way of approaching the postcolonial situation in the region. Das Konzept der Performativität des Gebens innerhalb einer ethnisch gemischten Gemeinschaft (Norweger und Samen) an der Küste Norwegens steht im Mittelpunkt dieses Artikels. Inspiriert durch die Theorien von Mauss und Ricœur verfolgt der Autor die Idee, dass das Geben eine wichtige Funktion in isolierten Gemeinschaften übernimmt und zum Aufkommen eines Gefühls von Gemeinschaft und Identität beiträgt. Das Geben wird zu einem performativen Akt unter den Ethnien und zu einer Mittel mit der postkolonialen Situation der Region umzugehen. Artikkelen adresserer gavens performativitet i etniske sammensatte kystsamfunn bestående av samisk og norsk befolkning. Inspirert av Mauss og Ricœur blir det argumentert for at å gi gaver ; er viktig i disse samfunnene og kan ses som konstituerende i forhold til både fellesskap og identitet. Gavebytte er handlinger som relasjoner gjøres gjennom og adresserer etnisk ambivalens, i tillegg til à være tilnærmingsmåter til den postkoloniale situasjon i region.<br>

Abstract: The article begins with an analysis of the concept of identity and a description of two theoretical traditions which lie at the source of this concept and which determine the operationalisations of the identity concept within the context of social change (G.H. Mead and E. Erikson). The author then goes on to discuss the problems which evolve from the many applications of the concept of identity to analysis of collectives. The concept of collective identity is outlined and four basic ways of understanding this concept in contemporary sociology are discussed. The author refers in his presentation to the works of F. Barth, R. Turner, A. Touraine, S. N. Eisenstadt, E. Gellner, and A. Kłoskowska. The author concludes his article with several comments focusing on the relationships between social change and collective identity and he refers to those approaches which either stress the relative independence of identity formulae and social structure or even view the evolving patterns of identity as a factor contributing to social change.<br>

Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Abstract: At present there is under utilization of maternity service provision in Nigeria, with only a third of childbearing women electing to deliver in healthcare facilities. This is relevant since Nigeria's maternal mortality rate is second highest in the world and is estimated at 1,100 per 100,000 live births. To date, studies have sought cause and effect and have neglected the opinion of the people about what they perceive to be problematic and what they believe constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision. An exploratory qualitative study was carried out to identify pregnant women in a rural Niger Delta community's perceptions of conventional maternity service provision. Participants included 8 pregnant Niger Delta women from differing sub-groups within the homogeneous population. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore informants' views of what constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision, what comprises inadequate care, barriers that obstruct delivery of maternity care, and what promotes positive outcomes. Five major themes emerged from the data. These included: (1) Women's requirements for information; (1a) nutritional and dietary advice, (1b) how to recognise developing complications, (1c) appropriate fetal development, (1e) importance of attending clinics; (2) Staff services required: (2a) availability, (2b) well managed, and (2c) good quality; (3) Apparatus: (3a) equipment available, (3b) adequate infrastructure; (4) Affordability; (5) Place of traditional and spiritual methods. The interviewed childbearing Niger Delta women voiced several factors that they considered altered their satisfaction with maternity service provision. Finding out more about what causes satisfaction/dissatisfaction in childbearing women facilitates maternity care professionals to improve standards of care and allocate resources more effectively. Policy changes are driven by initiatives that reinforce strengths of current specification and recognise weaknesses. In addition, the WHO recommends that working towards improving health related culture is important. A l'heure actuelle, il y a une sous utilisation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux au Nigeria, étant donné qu'un tiers des femmes en âge de procréer optent pour accoucher dans des établissements de santé. Les études antérieure ont recherché la cause et l'effet et ont négligé les opinions des femmes concernant ce qu'elles croient être la bonne prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux. Nous avons mené une étude qualitative exploratrice pour identifier 8 femmes enceintes à partir des perceptions d'une communauté rurale du Niger Delta à l'égard de la prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux conventionnels. Des interviews semi-structures ont exploré les opinions des enquêtées sur ce qui constitue la prestation de services de gynécologieobstétricaux satisfaisant, ce qui constitue les soins insuffisants, les obstacles qui entravent la prestation de soins de gynécologieobstétricaux et ce qui avance les résultats positifs. Cinq thèmes importants ont émergé à partir des données : (i) Les besoins des femmes pour les renseignements ; 1a) le conseil nutritionnel et alimentaire, 1b) comment reconnaître des complications qui se préparent, 1c) le développement approprié des fétus, le) la nécessité de fréquenter les cliniques, 2) bien gérer, 2c) la bonne qualité 3) appareil 3a) l'équipement disponible, 3b) l'infrastructure adéquate ; 4) s'ils sont abordables ; 5) la place des méthodes traditionnelles et spirituelles. Les femmes enquêtées ont mentionné plusieurs facteurs qui ont modifié leur satisfaction avec la prestation de service de gynécologie-obstétricaux. La recherche supplémentaire concernant les causes de la satisfaction ou du mécontentement rend facile la tâche des professionnels de soins de maternité leur permettant d'améliorer la qualité de soin et d'affecter des ressources plus efficacement.<br>

Abstract: Needs Theory (NT) has been a corner stone for conflict resolution scholarship (CRS) as it was conceived by John Burton and other pioneers of the field. Intuitively, NT makes sense. There are fundamental needs that all human beings have that if violated may cause conflict. Indeed only those conflicts that are due to the violation of such needs can truly be deep-rooted (versus disputes). However, the structural foundations for NT are still not firmly established for a variety of reasons. Psychoanalysis and critical theory help us to understand and establish the various factors that go into constituting needs, in part by critiquing the positivistic framework that has heretofore been primarily utilized in NT scholarship<br>

Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: This paper argues that the analysis of culture and mass communication should be regarded as central concerns of sociology and social theory. It develops a framework for the analysis of culture and shows how this framework can be applied to the study of mass communication. Focusing on the medium of television, the paper highlights some of the distinctive characteristics of mass communication and examines some of the factors involved in the production, construction and reception of media messages. It is argued that this approach enables the analyst to pose questions concerning the ideological character of mass communication in a new and more fruitful way.<br>

Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergebnis einer Unterwerfung der historischen Züge philosophischer Tätigkeit unter ihre systematischen Züge zu durchleuchten.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: In this article we develop philosophically Cronbach's (1982) suggestion that the evaluator is an educator. The motivation for this article arose from problems encountered by us on a major evaluation project and from dissatisfaction with the existent philosophical underpinnings of evaluation theory. We propose, and provide a justification for, a model of evaluation based upon the notion of the evaluator as educator, which is sufficiently broad philosophically not only to subsume scientistic and humanistic models, but also to transcend them. Within this broad philosophical model we develop a particular theory of evaluation, based essentially upon Wittgenstein, and in which the notion of a learning community is taken as central. Finally we consider some practical implications of this theory of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: This article looks at the beginnings of anti-apartheid/anticolonial literary cultures in Johannesburg and Maputo (then Lourenqo Marques) after the Second World War. It pays specific attention to the ways in which they attempted to harness aesthetics of "newness." By focusing on the influential journals Drum (1951-) and Itinerário (1941-1955), I argue that both journals tapped into transnational intellectual currents such as Harlem Renaissance writing, but that the discrete discursive networks of English and Portuguese contributed to a differentiation of their aesthetic approaches. Itinerdrio acted out an avantgarde-like resistance to bourgeois/colonial culture. Drum was market-driven and achieved in its early phase a compromise between a racially circumscribed mass-cultural appeal and the literate ideals of mission-educated South African blacks. These differences can then be factored into an analysis of persistent differences between the literatures of South Africa and Mozambique.<br>

Abstract: Does a literary text remain the same object across time? This essay answers no and bases a defense of literature on that answer. Temporal extension, a phenomenon neglected in contemporary literary studies, makes some meanings unrecoverable and others newly possible. A text endures as a nonintegral survivor, an echo of what it was and of what it might become, its resonance changing with shifts in interpretive contexts. Since this resonance cannot be addressed by synchronic historicism, I propose an alternative, diachronic historicism, inspired especially by scientific theories on background noise, by Einstein's account of the relativity of simultaneity, and by critiques of the visual bias in Western epistemology. I try to theorize the text as a temporal continuum, thick with receding and incipient nuances, exercising the ears of readers in divergent ways and yielding its words to contrary claims. Literature thus encourages a semantic democracy that honors disagreement as a crucial fact of civil society.<br>

Abstract: Examination of cultural and social factors surrounding zar spirit possession diagnoses in Northern Sudan suggests that a major issue addressed by the cult is the cultural overdetermination of women's selfhood. Circumcision and infibulation operate to establish in women a sense of self congruent with the cultural image of woman as reproducer. When experiences and expectations fail to mesh, some women fall ill and are ultimately diagnosed as possessed. Through acceptance of the possession diagnosis and participation in curing rites involving trance, a patient is given scope to expand and regenerate her sense of self and recontextualize her experiences.

Abstract: The indigenous peoples of South America culturally code sensory perceptions in varied and complex ways. This article outlines and compares the sensory models of indigenous cultures from two contrasting South American regions: the central Andean highlands and the Amazonian lowlands. While the various peoples of the Andes appear to share the same basic sensory model, those of the Amazon manifest significant differences in the symbolic values they accord the different senses. One common factor among the Amazonians, which also distinguishes them from the Andeans, is the importance given to the senses dependent on proximity, particularly smell. Such differences can be attributed to a variety of causes and are seen to have a variety of cultural effects. In conclusion, the anthropological implications of examining indigenous theories and modes of perception are explored. [South America, Andes, Amazon, anthropology of the senses]<br>

Abstract: This study among the Maneo (Seram, Indonesia) focuses on the pragmatics of kinship knowledge. Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Abstract: Peirce's general theory of signs, or semiotic, as he called it, yields a theory of the self that sees it both as the object and the subject of semiotic systems. From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology<br>

Abstract: An ethnographic study of a shelter in downtown Boston for people considered homeless and mentally ill documents the way in which the category of "experience," which many have taken to be universal and natural, is culturally and historically constituted. The residents of the shelter tend not to experience - defined here as an inwardly reflexive process that proceeds, coheres, and transforms through temporally integrative forms - but rather "struggle along" by way of an acutely tactile mode of perception that attends to episodic, temporally finite encounters. The fact that experience in the shelter is only a possibility, not a given, points to the need for a critical phenomenology that would help us to consider how this and other ways of being come about through specific social, cultural, political, and material forces.<br>

Abstract: Do divergent values embedded in distinctive cultures satisfactorily explain current directions in public service ethics around the world? The authors draw upon expert observation by government and corporate officials who administer ethics programs, leaders known for their moral courage, survey research, and the scholarly literature to identify these directions and begin addressing the question. The central argument is that observable practice increasingly invalidates an approach that relies exclusively upon cultural particularities. Identified commonalties susceptible to objective research include shared values and norms such as impartiality and effectiveness in public service, structural elements in part fostered by shared goals and multinational anti-corruption initiatives, and the self-conscious injection of normative components into ethics programs. Emerging from a cross-cultural empirical perspective that allows for mutualities as well as differences, the authors' rich research agenda included investigation of the alleged links between public attitudes and ethics programs and between codes and actual administrative behavior, and development of appropriate measures of ethics programs' effectiveness. They concluded that professional public administration must remain intellectually open to global dialogue on shared values, norms, and structures.<br>

Abstract: Surface reading and similar developments in literary study advocate a turn away from symptomatic reading toward the superficial and self-evident. Arguing for the productivity of these approaches despite the contradictory language in which they have sometimes been formulated, this essay develops a related form of analysis: literal or denotative reading. Denotative reading does not reject deep or figurative interpretive possibilities. Rather, it insists they must be pursued in close connection with the facticity of fictional worlds, particularly in the case of maritime and other fiction deploying a specialized, technical lexicon. The essay treats Joseph Conrad's
         Heart of Darkness(1899) as an exemplary instance of such fiction, contending that its precise articulation of tidal currents, nautical maneuvers, and ship design signals the key role of “restraint” not only in this novella but throughout Conrad's corpus.<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain.

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: For, if phenomenology renounces its search for the absolute and for foundations, then it must give up seeing itself as a single and self-contained discourse. The minimal phenomenologist renounces monolinguism and is no longer the master of only one discourse. Instead, he or she must practice a mixed discourse. To do this is to practice diglossia, to become a code-switcher. In its ordinary sense, the practice of code-switching refers to the passage from one language or dialect to another one in the course of a single conversation, for instance, when the conversation moves from an informal to a formal setting or when it moves from one topic to another. But in the phenomenological context, this would involve the ability to shift from a phenomenological discourse to its “others,” whether they might be Freudian energetics, Deleuzian aspects, Badiouan events, and so on. This practice of translation or code-switching has perhaps always been the role of the phenomenologist, if it is accepted that phenomenological reflection does not begin from itself but is nourished by a life that precedes it and gives rise to it.<br>

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: The recent pragmatic-contextual theory of fiction entails the possibility of changes between fact and fiction over the course of time. It is also perhaps commonplace to state that this process can be reversed—that fictional texts may cease to be fictional. The question of generic fiction-to-fact transition, however, is rarely confronted in the theory of fiction. This essay investigates the generic expectations attached to texts that make a full-scale transition from fiction to nonfiction difficult, both culturally and psychologically. “Fiction” is understood here in a limited, pragmatic sense of a work of fiction, a text known and categorized as fiction. The discussion is structured around five interrelated reasons that contribute to the difficulty: (1) the commonness of as-if structures in everyday life; (2) the generic combinations among literature, fiction, factual representation, and narrative; (3) the relative stability of the communal values and ways of checking facts that determine the categories of fiction and fact (the fact convention); (4) the popularity, in fiction, of metalepsis and the theme of transworld travel between different ontological spheres; (5) and the fictionalization of literature in the historical perspective.<br>

Abstract: Drawing upon recent ideas from the cognitive sciences, this paper is an interdisciplinary exploration of the representation of consciousness in McEwan's novel
         Enduring Love, focussing on overlapping manifestations of Theory of Mind ranging from altruism to violent pathology. Through techniques such as intertextuality, the use of paratexts, and the juxtaposition of scientific and literary discourses, McEwan constructs this novel as a Theory of Mind creating a demanding and appealing reading experience that mirrors the doubt and uncertainty of the characters as they strive to understand each others' minds. McEwan's deep interest in science and what it can and cannot tell us about human nature is a potent theme inEnduring Love. This article argues thatEnduring Loveexposes and exploits the unique potential of literary narrative to represent our intense desire to engage with other minds, both highlighting the fact that we are designed by nature to read and to misread minds, as well as the capacity of the novel to communicate the raw feel of human experience in a way that eludes scientific discourse.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we present an analysis of an Iron Age I dwelling at the Phoenician site of Dor, on Israel's Carmel coast. We provide a definition for the architectural mental template for this type of house—a Central Courtyard Hash-Plan House. By combining an analysis of the size and layout of the house, and the distribution of artifacts and ecofacts in it, we define rooms devoted to specialized economic activities such as food production and storage and also attempt to identify gendered spaces. We conclude that the house was a self-contained agrarian unit engaged in complex economic activity. The same conceptual plan, housing similar economic activities, can be identified in other dwellings in the southern Levant, from Late Bronze Age I to Late Iron Age IIA. The gradual disappearance of this house type, vis-à-vis the emergence, on the one hand, of smaller and simpler dwellings such as the ubiquitous Four-Room House and, on the other, that of public facilities for specialized economic tasks, signifies to our minds a fundamental ideological and economic transformation, a change in the
         habitusof Levantine society—namely, the gradual segregation between households and various aspects of economic life.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/bullamerschoorie.372.0039">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5615/bullamerschoorie.372.0039</a>

Abstract: In a period of immanent crisis when comprehensive historical narratives are no longer possible—nor is utopia—dystopia, or rather uchronia tinged with dystopia, seems to be a rather effective means to construct a sweeping historical narration. Through the “timeless time” of uchronia in which—as Ricoeur explains in
         Time and Narrative(vol. III)—“we are torn between two fleeing horizons” so that “our present sees itself in crisis,” Roth looks back at a counterfactual past in order to better investigate historical causality and to embrace past and present into a postmodern problematic perspective on the temporal dimension.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on the role of the “Survey on Regional Architecture in Portugal” in 1955 and its effects on contemporary Portuguese architecture. A photographic survey organizes and indexes a group of buildings with precise criteria, allowing a general panorama. In fact these built-environment, large-scale archives play an important role in heritage preservation. In the 1930s, an interesting phenomenon gathered architects who, although committed to the modern movement and enthusiasts of industrial progress, showed a growing interest in vernacular buildings and settlements. Some of these architects became photographers, attentive to a pre-industrial world that was endangered, to record timeless architecture and expose new aesthetic values. This interest generated several movements centered on an appreciation of regional architecture. Along with nostalgia, there stood out the feeling that there were still many lessons to be drawn from these threatened vernacular structures.<br>
