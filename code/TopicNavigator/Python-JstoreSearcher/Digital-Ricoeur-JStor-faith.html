  CHAPTER 5  Priestly Violence, Martyrdom, and Jesuits: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Redden Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The question of what makes a Jesuit, the
                  quidditas jesuitica, is thrown into stark relief by the extraordinary case of Diego de Alfaro (d.1639) and its apologia, written in 1644 by the former provincial of the Paraguayan province, Diego de Boroa (d.1657).² Alfaro—superior of the missions of Guairá in the province of Paraguay—took up arms in 1639 and fought alongside his Guarani faithful againstbandeirantes(slave raiders) from the Portuguese city of São Paulo; in the gunfight with these slavers, Alfaro was killed. Portuguese and Spanish detractors of the Society alike decried the scandal of a priest under<br>

  Creating Carnivores and Cannibals: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) CHEZ KERIDIANA<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, the dog and the horse were man’s best friends. Sagacious, affectionate, and loyal, dog and horse were represented as faithful and helpful creatures that had played key roles in the development of civilization. Frameworks like the animal protection movement enabled, and encouraged, the development and intensification of these affectionate ties. Yet in spite of these ties, the horse was systematically served up to the dog for dinner.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Historical Forms of Mystification from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  1  Conversing about Faith and Media in America from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt6fv">Christianity and the Mass Media in America</a><br>
  Abstract: A lexis de Tocqueville recalled reading a news story during his visit to the United States in the 1830s about a court in New York where a witness declared that he did not believe in the existence of God or the immortality of the soul. As a result of the witnessʹs confession, the judge refused ʺto accept his oath, given, he said, that the witness had destroyed in advance all the faith that could have been put in his words.ʺ Apparently astonished by the story, Tocqueville added to his report the fact that the newspaper offered no commentary about the<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  A Generation Afterward from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: In Vietnam, household death-commemoration rites are a rich store of historical evidence. Numerous incidents from past wars are faithfully recorded in these rites, even though the archives and monuments may carry no trace of these incidents. On several occasions, including in the late 1980s and again in the late 1990s, village administrations in the provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai collaborated with researchers from the provincial Communist Party on a survey of wartime casualties. They uncovered many previously unknown incidents, but these surveys left out as many cases as they revealed. People tended to report only the incidents of<br>

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  12  Missiology and the Interreligious Encounter from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppt8r">Studying Global Pentecostalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Richie Tony<br>
  Abstract: Pentecostals have always been heavily involved in missions and hold missionaries in high esteem as extraordinary heroes of the faith.¹ But they have traditionally not given as much thought to the topic of theology of religions, or interreligious dialogue and encounter, as to other theological loci.² Why this is the case may be related in part to the fact that academic Pentecostalism is but a recent arrival to the theological scene, with its first generation of professionally trained theologians—as opposed to historians or biblical scholars—emerging only since the early 1990s.³ Yet Pentecostal scholars can no longer avoid giving<br>

  6  The Baha’i Tradition: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Lawson Todd<br>
  Abstract: In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith this came to be. Here I will first offer a brief discussion of the<br>

  7  Justifiable Force and Holy War in Zoroastrianism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Choksy Jamsheed K.<br>
  Abstract: There are numerous past and present scholarly debates over interpretations of theological, ritual, and philological issues in the Zoroastrian Avesta, or scriptures, and its
                     Zand, or priestly commentaries. However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Abstract: The most critical issue for any model of doctrinal development is the question of doctrinal continuity. Can doctrines
                     develop, grow, orprogresswithout compromising their fidelity to “the faith once delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3)? Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: What is the condition of possibility for a
                  moderntheology? In pursuing this question, we are not asking what it is that makes a theology modern as opposed to, say, premodern. We are rather asking, in typical transcendental form: Given that there is such a thing as modern theology, what must be the case in order to make such a theology possible? What must be true about the Christian faith to make sense, for example, of Karl Barth’s “reconstruction of Christian orthodoxy” under the conditions of modernity?¹ At a minimum, an answer to this problem must be thatChristianity is<br>

  5  The Truth of Myth and the Necessity of Demythologizing from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: Scholars have spilled a lot of ink criticizing Bultmann’s program of demythologizing on the grounds that it ignores the truths that myths, particularly those associated with Christian faith, are uniquely able to communicate. The truth of myth is played off against demythologizing as if the latter rejects myth
                  simpliciter. One often hears that demythologizing is merely the extrication of the kerygma from the shackles of myth on the assumption that Bultmann views everything associated with the label of myth as primitive falsehood. Many suppose that demythologizing carries out its hermeneutical procedure by shucking the husk of what is ancient or<br>

  8  Eschatological Existence and Existentialist Translation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: We noted in the previous chapter Bultmann’s claim that radical demythologizing is “the consistent application [of the doctrine of justification by faith alone] to the field of knowledge.”² This application has both a negative and a positive dimension. Negatively it is criticism of objectifying thinking within the
                     Weltbildof mythology, which I suggest we can restate ascriticism of constantinianism. Demythologizing is a critical epistemology in the sense that it subverts every attempt to interpret the kerygma in the form of aWeltanschauung. It is thus an antimythological and antimetaphysical—i.e., deconstantinizing—hermeneutic.<br>

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878n5">The Mission of Demythologizing</a><br>
  Abstract: Martin Heidegger expressed his hope to Bultmann in 1964 that “your whole work might not remain entirely obscured by the label ‘demythologizing.’”² In one sense it is deeply unfortunate that Heidegger’s wish was unfulfilled. Bultmann’s name is forever associated with that controversial label, to such an extent that many are unable to read him without assuming that every writing of his is a threat to the church and harmful to the faith. In another and more important sense, however, we can be
                  gratefulthat Heidegger’s wish was unfulfilled, for demythologizing remains Bultmann’s greatest gift to the church. In the words<br>

  Abstract: Creative words and creative potential burst the world into being, according to the theology of the creation narratives of the opening chapters of Genesis. In John, Jesus was and is and becomes the Word. With words, God calls forth life and trees, stars and sunsets, oceans and rivers, animals and humanity. Color, design, beauty, creativity, and wonder are encapsulated—as best they can be—in words. And as best we can, we use our finite words to capture the infinite. Theology—faith seeking understanding—is most often articulated in language, words, sentences, grammar, structure, paragraphs, papers, and books. As a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878ws">Power and Politics in the Book of Judges</a><br>
  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Abstract: For over a quarter of a century, scholars have been interested in a set of questions broadly grouped under the heading “Derrida and Religion.” Since the 1980s, when Derrida began to apply deconstructive insights directly to questions of faith and religion, the provocation of this engagement has remained of major concern across the humanities.¹ For this reason, it would be wrong to consider the question of Derrida and religion simply as a partial look at an important thinker, similar to, say, Hegel and aesthetics or Hume and politics, where research is limited to the overlap between the two: the conjunction<br>

  Author(s) BARING EDWARD<br>
  Abstract: There was no religious turn. Many of the papers in this volume focus on texts from the 1990s. It was at this time that Derrida turned the formidable arsenal of a deconstructive methodology to questions of faith, messianism, and negative theology. The concentration on this period has led to an assumption that what one can loosely call “deconstruction” developed elsewhere for different purposes and was only belatedly applied to religious questions and theology. In this narrative religion was the newfound passion of a middle-aged man.<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary debates the most common charge made against religion—whether by those who seek to abolish or to renew religious faith—is that it tends to generate violence and intolerance.² While religious teachings often emphasize love and tolerance, it is easy enough to recite a litany of genocides, persecutions, and wars pursued in the name of one religion or another. For the new atheists, such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, this violent track record is the clearest example of how religion poisons everything and corrupts a humanity that otherwise would stand a better chance of being peaceful.

Theology is the church thinking about what it believes. In itself, theology is not the content of what the church believes. Rather it is reflection on the content of that belief.

Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

Those who are poor in spirit, or who mourn, or who are meek are blessed in some enigmatic way, says Jesus, because these dispositions somehow anticipate the salvation that God has promised will come.

Theology is the church thinking about what it believes. In itself, theology is not the content of what the church believes. Rather it is reflection on the content of that belief. One puts faith in God, and this faith comes to expression in the way life is lived and in what is believed. The content of belief is found in the symbols that accompany faith.

  11  Eschatology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: Salvation is already present to us in faith. It is present in faith, but not in experience—at least not in uninterrupted, continual, plenary, uncontradictable experience. Faith is under continual attack by temptation from within and suffering from without, due to the warfare between the two aeons, due to the conflict between the present and the future. Beatitudinal living is living between the times: we both have and await the blessings that Christ has wrought. We live out of the power of salvation that dwells within our hearts while yet awaiting salvation to come in its fullness. We express the<br>

  Introduction to Part Five from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: Theology is an ongoing task with which Christians are never finished because something new is always placed on its agenda. Although it is the thinking discipline whereby faith seeks to understand itself, it is also a part of the church’s ministry. Its peculiar ministry is to provide intellectual leadership. The present work in systematic theology has sought to explicate the significance of the gospel so that what Christians say is intelligible within the context of modern and emerging postmodern consciousness. Thus, a methodological foundation was laid, scriptural symbols explicated, doctrinal content clarified, and hypothetical reconstruction begun. In turning now to<br>

  14  Proleptic Ethics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wwwrr">God--The World's Future</a><br>
  Abstract: The spirituality that accompanies a proleptic understanding of the Christian faith is what I call the life of beatitude. The name comes from the structure of Jesus’ Beatitudes in Matthew 5:1-12, where the blessings of the future kingdom of God are mysteriously present now in anticipation. Those who are poor in spirit, or who mourn, or who are meek are blessed in some enigmatic way, says Jesus, because these dispositions somehow anticipate the salvation that God has promised will come. Those who hunger and thirst after justice, show mercy, and make peace already participate even if unknowingly in the wholeness<br>

  Book Title: The Creative Word-Canon as a Model for Biblical Education<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Erickson Amy<br>
  Abstract: Every faith community knows the challenges of inviting new members and the next generation into its shared life without falling into an arid traditionalism or a shallow relativism. Renowned scholar Walter Brueggemann finds a framework for education in the structure of the Hebrew Bible canon, with its assertion of center and limit (in the Torah), of challenge (in the Prophets), and of inquiry (in the Writings). Incorporating the best insights from his own career and from the fields of canonical criticism, Old Testament theology, and pedagogical theory, Brueggemann offers a vision of how the community can draw on the shape of Scripture to educate its members. First published in 1982, The Creative Word is now updated and introduced with a foreword by Amy Erickson of Iliff School of Theology.<br>

  8  Toward a Holistic Theology of the Emotions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvhj">Tastes of the Divine: Hindu and Christian Theologies of Emotion</a><br>
  Abstract: There is no inherent reason that European philosophical traditions must govern Christian theology across the globe. The cultures of Asia, Africa, and South America, where the majority of Christians now live, offer categories for imagining the life of faith, not only for local or indigenous theologies but for the theological “mainstream” as well. As an aesthetic perspective that relates contextual and bodily aspects of emotion to religious experience,

  Author(s) O’DONNELL MARY ELLEN<br>
  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

  Abstract: How to pass on “the faith”? We certainly are not the first generation—and I hope not the last—to ask this question. One can find evidence of such concerns, sometimes oblique, other times explicit, in Paul’s letters, among the earliest extant Christian writings. A host of difficult questions came early to those communities that the first apostles founded. What does it mean to believe in the name of Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified, the cruelest, the most despised, the most shocking form of empire-orchestrated execution? What does it mean to believe in the one whose tomb was<br>

  Author(s) Morrow Derek J.<br>
  Abstract: As even a cursory glance at the current literature will confirm, the task of investigating the many philosophical and theological questions raised by Jean-Luc Marion’s explorations into the phenomenology of the gift and of givenness (
                  donation) has only begun. Not least of these questions, of course, is the purely formal one of methodology. For although Marion’s phenomenology ofdonationhas generated significant criticism from several quarters—both from scholars who regard it as insufficiently phenomenological and thus as a betrayal of phenomenology (Janicaud¹), and from scholars who consider it to have unduly compromised the theological prerogatives of the Christian faith<br>

  Abstract: How could there be a vibrant religious life without the practice of prayer?

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

The result is that Westphal has shown how useful Nietzsche can be for believers (Christians, of course, but not them alone) in thinking about their faith and theology.² Although not uncritical of Nietzsche, Westphal has teased out the implications of Nietzsche’s criticism of Christianity and made a forceful case for Nietzsche being all too often

  Book Title: For Derrida-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller J. Hillis<br>
  Abstract: This book-the culmination of forty years of friendship between J. Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida, during which Miller also closely followed all Derrida's writings and seminars-is for Derridain two senses. It is for him,dedicated to his memory. The chapters also speak, in acts of reading, as advocates for Derrida's work. They focus especially on Derrida's late work, including passages from the last, as yet unpublished, seminars. The chapters are partial to Derrida,on his side, taking his part, gratefully submitting themselves to the demand made by Derrida's writings to be read-slowly, carefully, faithfully, with close attention to semantic detail.The chapters do not progress forward to tell a sequential story. They are, rather, a series of perspectives on the heterogeneity of Derrida's work, or forays into that heterogeneity.The chief goal has been, to borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, plainly to propoundwhat Derrida says. The book aims, above all, to render Derrida's writings justice. It should be remembered, however, that, according to Derrida himself, every rendering of justice is also a transformative interpretation. A book like this one is not a substitute for reading Derrida for oneself. It is to be hoped that it will encourage readers to do just that.<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x026n">Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: The rise of religious fundamentalism in the closing decades of the twentieth century continues to have enormous repercussions not only for politics, but also for the disciplines of the human sciences, philosophy, and theology. The sociology of religion, perhaps the paradigmatic achievement of the discipline of sociology, has been dealing with the effects of the crisis of its theories of secularization. The so-called deprivatization of religion has forced on the table the old-age question of the relation between God and society, or faith and the constitution of community, with the added complication that the community at stake nowadays is a<br>

  Author(s) Connolly William E.<br>
  Abstract: What is the connection today between evangelical Christianity, cowboy capitalism, the electronic news media, and the Republican Party?¹ Can these connections be understood through the terms of efficient causality, in which you first separate factors and then show how one is the basic cause, or how they cause each other, or how they together reflect a more basic cause? Does, say, a corporate-Republican elite manipulate the evangelical wing of this assemblage, leading the latter to subordinate its economic interests to spurious appeals to faith? Or are the leading parties to this coalition linked first and foremost by economic interests, in<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Abstract: It must be something of a paradox to identify the sociopolitical and intellectual context of the renewal of French Catholicism in the third and fourth decades of the twentieth century by appealing to an agnostic intellectual, a poet, thinker, and public writer who, in the preceding period, observes the church, its beliefs, practices, and behavior—closely, to be sure—but with unfailing skepticism and consistently from the outside, looking in.

  Abstract: Though a preeminent example of French intellectual culture, the influence of the
                  renouveau catholique—the early twentieth-century revival of French Catholic literature and thought—stretched out beyond metropolitan France and even francophone Europe to touch an island of European intellectual life in North America: Quebec. Perceiving themselves as part of a larger European intellectual milieu, young French Canadians seized upon the new ideas emerging from Catholic France to refashion their understanding of faith and its relationship to politics, culture, and society. One of the most important vehicles for this Catholic revival in Quebec was the Montreal-based periodicalLa Relève, founded<br>

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  THE HARLOT AND THE GIANT: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0610">Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs</a><br>
  Author(s) Pertile Lino<br>
  Abstract: In his treatise the
                  Monarchy, Dante argues against those who maintained that the foundation of faith consists in the traditions of the church. He distinguishes three stages in the history of Scripture: before the church (i.e. the Old and the New Testament), with the church (the early fathers), and after the church (thedecretales). In defining the first stage, the stageante Ecclesiam, Dante states that “this is what the Church says speaking to her bridegroom: ‘Draw me after thee.’ ”¹ The standard footnote tells us that this sentence—“Trahe me post te” in the Vulgate’s Latin—is a quotation<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

  Abstract: In the letter inviting me to accept the Marianist Award for the year 2004, your president, Dr. Curran, suggested that I might take the occasion to speak of the relationship of faith to my own scholarly work. The proposal immediately captured my fancy since faith and theology have been, so to speak, the two poles of my existence. The subject, besides, has considerable importance for our time and place, because many of the difficulties we experience in Church and society are due to the impoverishment of faith or to theology that is not in harmony with faith.<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x06n9">Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims</a><br>
  Author(s) Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: Jaroslav Pelikan, the well-known Yale historian of Christian doctrine, worried whether his grandchildren would have a religious tradition to reject. So pervasive did he consider the acidic effects of modern Western culture on religion that he feared that communities of faith would, over the coming generation or two, simply dissolve. Historians are rarely given to apocalyptic prediction; rather, they typically warn us about repeating the history from which we have never learned. But Pelikan has not been the only person who has worried about religion’s future in the West. Religious leaders and sociologists and theologians have been asking similar questions:<br>

  Author(s) de Toca Melchor Sánchez<br>
  Abstract: As we neared the public presentation of the Pontifical Council for Culture’s 2004 research into unbelief, religious indifference, and new forms of alternative religion, I somewhat absentmindedly recited to my secretary a rather detached theoretical analysis of unbelief. Unable to restrain herself, she burst out with her very own story: “My children have lost the faith.” They are good boys, born to a Christian family, whose mother works in the Vatican and is active in the parish. But they no longer go to Mass on Sundays. Indeed, not only do they no longer practice, but quite simply they no longer<br>

  Abstract: The questions raised by this conference are both professional and personal for me. As a sociologist, the social changes of the last forty years have provided ample fodder for research, and I’ll attempt to tell you some of the things I think we’ve discovered in the process. But as a parent of a daughter born in 1980, I also stand before you with many of the same concerns that I suspect brought some of you here. Will our children have a faith to guide them?

  Author(s) Bagby Ihsan<br>
  Abstract: Muslim immigrants started arriving in America in large numbers after the 1965 liberalization of immigration law. They achieved economic success, raised families, and established mosques as a commitment to retaining their faith and passing on that faith to their children.¹ Now, after four decades, the children of these immigrants are maturing—a significant portion of them are in high school and college and some are starting their own families. Using data and interviews from a study of Detroit mosques,² this paper looks at second-generation mosque-goers and addresses three issues: 1) the second generation’s sense of belonging to the mosque; 2)<br>

  Author(s) Winston Diane<br>
  Abstract: From their origins, the Abrahamic faiths have placed a high premium on transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Yet each of the traditions has developed its own methods for religious training. That’s why an opportunity for educators from different faith traditions and professional disciplines to come together holds special promise. Unexpected similarities may bring comfort, just as unanticipated differences can spur revelatory insights.<br>

  Book Title: The Relevance of Royce-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: This collection represents the rediscovery of Josiah Royce's rich legacy that has occurred over the past decade. The first part presents a series of historical explorations. The second takes up practical extensions of Royce's work, bringing his ideas and methods to bear on contemporary philosophical matters. Among the topics addressed are the paradoxes of individualism; loyalty, democracy, and community; Royce's efforts to respond to historical American racism; his contributions to engaged inter-faith religious discourse; the promise of his theory of error for a feminist account of knowledge; and his ethics of loyalty as a component in medical ethics.<br>

  Abstract: Warm-up pitches can help us start.¹ I write in this paper as a philosopher of religion examining statements Royce made about intrafaith relationships. I use the term “intrafaith” to indicate the interpersonal relations between members of the world religions—Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc.² Then, too, in 1912 what Royce did
                  notknow about “the historical Jesus” contrasts sharply with today’s far more nuanced and subtle treatment of that topic. In addition, Royce used the term “Christian” in two senses, each determinable from its context. Sometimes he spoke of “Christian” in the narrow sense of a person baptized with<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Abstract: In his analysis of scripturally based faith as an opening of questions rather than a settling of answers, Jacques Ellul declares, with not unmerited irritation, “We must vigorously reject that nasty habit of turning to the Bible for an answer to the banal problems of everyday … or, still worse, the custom of opening the Bible at random to find some providential verse.”¹ It is hard for those of us who love books not to approve immediately of this, to find it disrespectful of a text with such historical and literary weight to treat it as if it were a<br>

  Abstract: It is as clear for the writers to be discussed here as it was for Leo XIII that, when one brings the strongest attributes of imaginative literature to bear directly upon Catholic faith and practice, liturgy becomes the primary site of interaction. Moreover, when that literature is dedicated to representing the body, the possibilities for a sustained and compelling correspondence increase significantly. During the drama of the Mass, individual bodies join symbolically and actually with each other and with the body of Christ. As the novelist Ron Hansen says, Catholics<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0bn7">Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Because the panegyric discourse of Vatican II strives to embrace such a broad vision of the Church, it tends to laud the social dimension of the faith. Of course, Catholicism has a long and rich tradition of social engagement. Nevertheless, this council emphasized the tradition in new ways. Consider that the Tridentine Profession of Faith in 1564 had characterized the Church as not only “holy, catholic, and apostolic” but also as “mother and teacher.”¹ It had insisted that salvation depended upon “true obedience” to one individual: “the Roman pontiff, successor of the blessed Peter, chief of the apostles, and vicar<br>

  Abstract: Among the thinkers of the past century who offer themselves to the future for its reflection, Santayana must stand out as a singular figure, one whose thought is dedicated to the overarching possibility of the spiritual life undertaken without religious faith or metaphysical dogma. Among the throngs that fill the philosophical bestiary of the twentieth century, Santayana may be the one genuine contemplative of note. The majority of doctrines dominant in the century have been directed either toward the goal of action (Marxism, pragmatism, existentialism) or the problem of knowledge, truth, and meaning (pragmaticism, positivism, analytic philosophy, phenomenology).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0c0w">The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence</a><br>
  Abstract: It is more than an understatement to say that philosophy today is not associated with “spirituality.” Professional philosophers disdain the topic. Some may try to approach it with a philosophical method, analytic or phenomenological, that is not itself inherently spiritual but cognitive. Those philosophers writing within a spiritual tradition—for example, people like Søren Kierkegaard, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Buber, or D. T. Suzuki—are segregated as “religious thinkers” or, like Emmanuel Levinas, seen as leading double lives. Otherwise the term “spirituality” suggests the range of New Age nostrums seeking to fill the void left by abandoned faiths and vapid materialism.<br>

  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel’s theistic philosophy traditionally has been labeled as a form of religious existentialism. While this is an accurate description of Marcel’s philosophy, I prefer to describe his philosophy as a sort of
                  reflective method. This way of describing his philosophy allows us to trace it back to its Kantian transcendentalist roots. Once we recognize the Kantian transcendentalist roots of his reflective method, we can better appreciate why he performs a detailed examination of the meaningfulness of human existence through such detrimental, life-affirming, or life-altering events as the death of a loved one, religious faith, despair, communion, hope, and love:<br>

  Abstract: To understand why I criticize Marcel’s religious existentialism for neglecting one of the most prominent forms of depersonalization in the twentieth century, antiblack racism, I should summarize Gordon’s existential phenomenological account of antiblack racism. However, it is not within the purview of this chapter to examine Gordon’s Africana existential phenomenological account of anitblack racism in detail, because doing so would require more than a chapter. Rather, what I will do is explicate some of the central phenomenological concepts used in his account of antiblack racism—namely,

  Abstract: I think that we are now in a position to outline, in very broad strokes, a Marcellian reflective method that takes seriously Gordon’s existential phenomenological account of antiblack racism. Such a modified Marcellian reflective method is still a phenomenological metaphysics. What I mean by
                  phenomenological metaphysicsis a metaphysics in which one refuses to investigate the essential structures of a mind-independent reality and concentrates, instead, on examining those ethical and religious values (for example, hope and faith) that enable persons to be closer to one another in a spiritual sense. Yet, metaphysics in this sense transcends philosophy proper; it involves<br>

  Book Title: Building a Heaven on Earth-Religion, Activism, and Protest in Japanese Occupied Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

Broadly speaking, we could say that he is one of the few, if not the only one, to have held together without confusion a religious faith and his engagement in philosophy (no “Christian philosophy,” here, to the contrary!).

  Book Title: Joy and Human Flourishing-Essays on Theology, Culture, and the Good Life<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Volf Miroslav<br>
  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

Such Christians have also stepped forward with their prison ministries and projects in anti-racism and advocacy for gender and sexual justice.

In other cases, as with some church “prison ministries,” Christians are in fact part of the problem, reinforcing today’s U.S. political ideologies that drive the U.S. criminal justice crisis.¹<br>

  Abstract: The Executed Godabounds with the rhetoric of opposition; or, so it may seem to many readers. Opening with a lament regarding Christendom’s betrayal of faith in the Jesus of Galilee and Golgotha, I move to a critique of Lockdown America as embodying a theatrics of state terror, seeking to show further how it serves the interests ofPax Americana, the ordered peace imposed by projects of U.S. global sovereignty and corporate power.<br>

  16  The Paradox of Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3m5">The Wisdom and Foolishness of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: There are only two possibilities: either one understands 1 Corinthians 1–2—that is, to put it in a concentrated way: the word of the cross (1 Cor. 1:18)—as the center of the Christian faith, or one does not understand 1 Corinthians 1–2 as the center of it.¹ Such a claim may seem trivial, as if one were saying: there are only two possibilities, either 1+2=3 or 1+2≠3. How can one claim that the mathematical example or, to give another example, the statement “either it is raining or it is not,” are claims which are self-evident, whereas the<br>

  16  Jesus and the Resurrection from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jm7q">Jesus the Central Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: A number of texts in the Scriptures present death as irremediable (see Pss 49:20; 88:9; Job 7:9–10; 14:7–22), but for Dan 12 and the “intertestamental” literature, faith in resurrection is a certainty (see 1 Enoch 51:1; 92:3–5; 2 Macc 7; 14:46; Wis. Sol. 2–4; 4 Ezra 7:32). In Jesus’s time, most Jews believed in the resurrection of the dead. Mark 12:18–27 (// Luke 20:27–38) reports Jesus’s rebuke of the Sadducees about this issue.¹ The entire New Testament presupposes Jesus’s resurrection. The gospel shows the disciples unanimously believing that Jesus, their Master, is alive and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xkf">Post-Holocaust France and the Jews, 1945-1955</a><br>
  Author(s) WINTER JAY<br>
  Abstract: This chapter contextualizes the claim that French Jews emerged from World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the republican tradition by presenting the opposite case, that of a man whose republican commitment was unshakable and indeed deepened by the war and the Shoah. René Cassin, jurist, international statesman, and one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, never lost his faith in the republican project at home and abroad. From 1940 on, he worked to revitalize that tradition, not to discard or refashion it.¹<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Saints in Catholic Intellectual Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: The full body of reflection on the truths of the Catholic faith represents the collected wisdom of intelligent and holy men and women from every part of the world over two millennia. Its tributaries include thousands of years of ancient Jewish experience as well as the cultures of Mesopotamia and Egypt; it draws on the entire heritage of classical Greece and Rome, the civilizations of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, romanticism, modernism, and our globalized postmodern culture. Briefly put, there is nothing quite like it.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  An Integrated Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: The catholic intellectual tradition begins with Catholics who become intellectuals or intellectuals who become disciples of Christ in his body the Church. But because both discipleship and the intellectual life are universal in scope, the life and worth of Catholic intellectuals is lived in the Church and in society at large. The institutionalization of that conversation between the human intellect and the faith that comes to us from the apostles began with the conversion of philosophers in ancient Rome and moved, over the centuries, from their schools and their coteries of disciples to the monastic schools during feudal times, then,<br>

  Abstract: The
                     saeculum, the area where the distinction between the profane and the sacred is played out, is the theater for two conversations. The first, between faith and culture, is important because both are ethically normative systems and, if the norms of the culture diverge too greatly from the norms of the faith, then believers live in great tension and the culture is imperfectly open to realities beyond itself. The second dialogue that takes place in thesaeculumis that between faith and reason, because faith gives us revealed truths and reason helps us to find what is true.<br>

  CHAPTER 8  Recent Popes and the Renewal of Catholic Intellectual Life from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15zc91j">A Godly Humanism</a><br>
  Abstract: If the second vatican council’s contribution to the dialogue between faith and reason in our day has to be understood as a word of continuity in principle, with recognition of discontinuity in situations, then it is equally important to recognize how the situation has been redefined by the Magisterium and ministry of Pope St. John Paul II. Seldom has a papacy been so grounded in guiding the conversation between faith and reason and in showing how, in the life of the pope himself, intellectual and spiritual lives are intertwined.<br>

  Book Title: Experiencing Scripture-Intimacy with Ancient Text and Modern Faith<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony F<br>
  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t8h5">From North to South</a><br>
  Author(s) Darragh Neil<br>
  Abstract: Schillebeeckx was acutely aware in his later writings of the different circumstances that shape people’s faith and theology. He was aware too that this diversity of cultures and politics was particularly urgent for the world of his time. He uses the word ‘situation’ as a term that stands over against ‘tradition’. ‘Situation’ then refers to the cultural, social and existential context of the people to whom the gospel is proclaimed here and now, the concrete situation in which the tradition of faith is handed on by Christians to new generations.¹<br>

  Author(s) Edwards Denis<br>
  Abstract: For many people in Australia and New Zealand, the death of Jesus on a Roman cross constitutes a problem of integrity in their life of faith. They ask: how could a loving God send the divine Son to be tortured to death? The theology of redemption they have imbibed involves God willing the death of Jesus on a cross as the means of our salvation. The biblical texts which say that Jesus ‘must’ suffer (Mk 8:31; Lk 24:26) are understood to mean that there was a divine requirement for the cruel death on the cross. This forms a pastoral problem<br>

  Author(s) Murphy-O’Connor Jerome<br>
  Abstract: The more conciliar documents of bygone years are studied, the extent to which they were conditioned by historical circumstances becomes more and more evident. It is important, therefore, to first situate

Then I shall examine what exactlyDVsaid about the New Testament, and conclude with an assessment of the impact of this document on the Church. It will appear that while authorities in the Church adhere faithfully to the directives ofDV, there remains a ground swell of bitter discontent among those who have not been brought up<br>

  Abstract: Standardisation is necessary for coordinated group activity. There must be some fixed point or process that keeps the diverse members of the group acting in concert. With regard to the sacred text of the Bible, the translator is called to be faithful to the text. Yet as the Word of God, the message is communicated by God’s speaking it and the members of the community hearing it. The letters on the page participate in this communicative act and facilitate it as a fixed point within the process of communication. The translation of God’s Word via human words is more than<br>

  Author(s): Pickard Stephen<br>
  Abstract: In-Between God' explores three important areas for contemporary Christianity: theology, community and discipleship. Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage.

  Author(s) Davidson Richard M<br>
  Abstract: One of the most crucial issues in biblical theology is the question of the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, and in particular, the use of Old Testament quotations by New Testament writers.¹ Those who maintain a high view of Scripture recognise the Bible’s self-testimony affirming the fundamental unity and harmony among its various parts.² Accepting this affirmation has in the past led to the assumption that the New Testament writers remain faithful to the original Old Testament contexts in their citation of Old Testament passages. This has been the consistent position of Christian scholarship until the rise of<br>

  Author(s): BOWER MARYA<br>
  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: Commitment to any one of the terms listed in the title of this volume seems to preclude commitment to either of the other two. Philosophical skepticism seems inimical to religious faith. Traditional religious faith is often understood as standing over against feminism. And feminist theories have frequently placed themselves in opposition to male-stream philosophy. So how can one live with the seemingly immiscible combination of being a philosopher, belonging to a traditional religion, and being a feminist? How can we make sense of being, as Diana Tietjens Meyers phrases it, “intersectional selves”¹ when those selves are at the intersection of<br>

It picks out aspects of ethics that have been overlooked or downplayed in most contemporary ethical theories, it arises out of a concern for building a theory from the perspective of women’s experiences, and it mandates behavior that seems the behavior an ethical theory ought to require. More than this, it meshes fairly well with my faith; the call to Care and the call to love one’s neighbor as oneself are very close, and Care’s emphasis on meeting the needs of the other fits well with the portrait of Christ one finds<br>

  Abstract: A colleague invited me to write an essay about some of the difficulties I face in trying to reconcile my philosophy, my feminism, and my faith. After two botched attempts to outline such an essay, I came to realize that I had nothing to say on the topic because I have no difficulties reconciling philosophy, feminism, and faith. Instead, all three pursuits converge in my understanding of tradition. This understanding is not an intellectual achievement, but a way of life.

  Author(s) NODDINGS NEL<br>
  Abstract: When we try to answer the question whether philosophy, feminism, and faith can be reconciled, we see that many people have attempted the reconciliation, and quite a few have done so to their own satisfaction. Despite the multitude of personally satisfying accounts, no universally accepted reconciliation has ever been constructed. To argue for the compatibility of philosophy, feminism, and faith, then, is not a mathematical sort of task—one that can be completed to the satisfaction of some professionally constituted public. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that neither philosophy nor feminism is a unitary body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): BOWER MARYA<br>
  Abstract: How can the seemingly separate lives of philosopher, feminist, and follower of a religious tradition come together in one person's life? How does religious commitment affect philosophy or feminism? How does feminism play out in religious or philosophical commitment? Wrestling with answers to these questions, women who balance philosophy, feminism, and faith write about their lives. The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages. The challenging and poignant reflections in Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith show how critical thought can successfully mesh with religious faith and social responsibility.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzdbv">Philosophy, Feminism, and Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Commitment to any one of the terms listed in the title of this volume seems to preclude commitment to either of the other two. Philosophical skepticism seems inimical to religious faith. Traditional religious faith is often understood as standing over against feminism. And feminist theories have frequently placed themselves in opposition to male-stream philosophy. So how can one live with the seemingly immiscible combination of being a philosopher, belonging to a traditional religion, and being a feminist? How can we make sense of being, as Diana Tietjens Meyers phrases it, “intersectional selves”¹ when those selves are at the intersection of<br>

  Author(s) GROENHOUT RUTH E.<br>
  Abstract: Care ethics strikes a deep chord with me. It picks out aspects of ethics that have been overlooked or downplayed in most contemporary ethical theories, it arises out of a concern for building a theory from the perspective of women’s experiences, and it mandates behavior that seems the behavior an ethical theory ought to require. More than this, it meshes fairly well with my faith; the call to Care and the call to love one’s neighbor as oneself are very close, and Care’s emphasis on meeting the needs of the other fits well with the portrait of Christ one finds<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzjvj">A Philosophical Anthropology of the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: Justifying religious faith through thinking consciousness: this is arguably the highest aspiration of the philosophy of religion. Whether this aspiration is itself justifiable, however, is another question. Can religious faith be grasped and grounded, so that its content is justified by the necessity of the philosophical concept? Does religious faith have its telos in philosophical consummation? Or does there remain some residual opacity that philosophy cannot penetrate, some otherness that philosophy cannot reconcile within its own conceptual scheme? How should philosophy approach a reality that claims to be an irresolvable scandal for philosophical thinking?<br>

  Abstract: Seldom do biblical scholars reach full agreement on issues of textual interpretation. That certainly has to do with the very nature of the texts themselves. One notable exception, the product of two centuries of scholarship, is the now generally accepted recognition that none of the four Gospels can be read simply as historical reportage but that each one must rather be taken as an ultimately irresolvable mix of discoverable “facts” and faith. The problem does not hang on a simple either/or but on an examination of the many points in between. Johannine scholarship has examined virtually every interpretive possibility that<br>

  Abstract: The account of the meeting of Jesus and the Samaritan woman (John 4:4–42) portrays the positive response of a Samaritan woman to Jesus’ mission. The Samaritan woman recognizes Jesus as the Messiah, and she then tells others in her town about Jesus. As a result of her actions, Jesus stays two days in the Samaritan town, and more Samaritans come to faith in him. There is no account of a Samaritan mission, however, in the other Gospels. Mark does not make any reference to the Samaritans, while Matthew includes a prohibition to the disciples not to enter a city<br>

  Abstract: One would be hard-pressed nowadays to find many commentators with the opinion that John’s story of the cure of the royal official’s son (John 4: 46b–54) is not the same event as the cure of the centurion’s boy at Capernaum in the Synoptics (Matt 8: 5–13; par. Luke 7:1–10). Unmistakable similarities abound: some kind of officer at Capernaum approaches Jesus to seek healing for a member of his household; the sick person is healed instantaneously without Jesus going to the house of the officer; and the issue of faith is a focal point in all three versions<br>

  Abstract: In his brief essay “De la liberté de conscience,”¹ Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) holds up as his hero the fourth-century Roman emperor Julian, surnamed by later (hostile) generations the Apostate. Julian (331–361/363 ce) was so labeled for having abandoned, upon becoming emperor, the Christian faith in which he was raised, and further for restoring paganism to the empire, thereby disestablishing Christianity as the empire’s official religion. This caused Saint Augustine to make of Julian one of the principal villains in his

  Civil Discourse and Religion in Transitional Democracies: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt175x2ht">Democracy, Culture, Catholicism: Voices from Four Continents</a><br>
  Author(s) Ingram David<br>
  Abstract: On January 19, 2004, world-renowned German political theorist Jürgen Habermas met with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) to discuss religion as one of the cultural foundations of the democratic state.¹ Two points of convergence emerged from their discussion. First, both agreed that reason alone cannot sustain respect for individual dignity and the common good without more substantive faith commitments. Second, they agreed that these values, however complementary they might be philosophically, are difficult to harmonize in practice.

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17mcsdm">Luther and Liberation</a><br>
  Author(s) Boff Leonardo<br>
  Abstract: Latin American theology occurs along two main lines. In one, one interrogates faith and tradition from the questioning of historicalsocial reality, particularly the large oppressed majorities. One discovers in these sources heretofore unsuspected dimensions that attune with the demands of liberation coming from everywhere. In the other, historical-social reality is illuminated with perspectives derived from faith, tradition, and the great theologians. There emerges the prophetic-denunciatory side of Christianity, its liberationist inspiration, and its unwavering utopian horizon, sustaining hope and utopias.<br>

  7  Sacraments from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17mcsdm">Luther and Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: Sacramental practice suffers, in a fairly general way, from a strong ambiguity. Quite widespread in Brazilian Lutheranism—and, if I am seeing correctly, in Catholicism too—is an individualist, magical, and uncommitted understanding of the efficacy of the sacraments. It refers to the practice of the sacraments as a holy recourse to divine forces, able to remedy problems and existential angst—even physical illnesses—without resulting in a deepening of faith, strengthening of community, and a commitment to love of the neighbor.<br>

  13  Resistance and Violence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17mcsdm">Luther and Liberation</a><br>
  Abstract: Do people who profess the Christian faith have the right and perhaps the duty to resist the constituted authorities? What would be legitimate means for a necessary resistance, and what would not? These questions will guide us in this chapter in our examination of Luther’s theology. We selected the main passages from the writings of the Reformer around the Peasants’ War. Still, to deduce Luther’s theology on the question of resistance to authorities only from these writings (a period of a few months) gives only a partial and thus, distorted picture. Therefore, one must take into account Luther’s positions in<br>

  Abstract: Christianity is a faith that roots, in time, those who would be Christian. But those same Christians are bound by those temporal roots, haunted by the knowledge that they cannot escape time. I want to explore that paradox in an effort to make what I hope will be some useful observations about how Christians understand, as well as tell, time by briefly examining time as God’s time (theological time), time as the secular time of modernity (worldly time), and the time of lived reality for the Christian, which mediates these other senses of time and imbricates them in one another<br>

Does a moral and just society need to be a community of fellow-believers, a churchly congregation writ large, faithful to the iteration of a particular tradition?

  Abstract: Most of the histories examined in the last chapter reconstruct origins and memory with present socio-political ends in mind. All derive from nostalgia for a past and present home, and seek to establish roots and legitimacy by reconstituting a New Caledonian history that guarantees their community its own place, cultural specificity, and centrality. The dialectic between literature and history, between European and New Caledonian homes, refashions the sense of history in these texts: a (hi)story that is more about a distinctive (group), a political message, and an ethical vision of the future than a faithful reproduction of a past society<br>

Suffering just one wound worthy of the name, he came through the war in France unscathed. Almost five years afterwards to the day he was demobilized, though the Great War did not end for him then.

  Abstract: In the last chapter, we saw that Bourdieu appeared to be embracing a peculiarly French republican vision of the role of formal education in ensuring universal access to knowledge and high culture. Echoing Durkheim’s support at the turn of the century for a secular and ‘rational’ education, Bourdieu’s calls, in
                  The Love of Art, for the establishment of a ‘rational pedagogy’ to replace a class-based ‘traditional’ form of education suggested a strong residual faith in the classical ideals of the French republican tradition. However, if this republicanism seemed strangely at odds with the radicalism of Bourdieu’s critique of legitimate culture,<br>

If we put our faith in the well known, if we place confidence in common sense, to what extent do we risk credulity? Hoaxes, as Judith Roof tells us, operate through the archive of the hoax – through our unforgotten knowledge that what seems too good to be true cannot be true.

  Abstract: There is only one way to properly understand Thomas Paine. He is the expatriate Briton whose intense belief in radical republican politics made him, this son of Norfolk Quakers, the writer of the American Revolution. Paine is the thinker whose political imaginary led him, in the moment before the thirteen colonies became independent, to coin no less than the phrase the “United States of America.” Paine’s faith in the American Revolution led him to dedicate Rights of Man, a “small treatise in defence of . . .

  Book Title: Our Bodies Are Selves-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Susan<br>
  Abstract: Our Bodies Are Selves is a look at what it means to be human in a world where medical technology and emerging ethical insight force us to rethink the boundaries of humanity/spirit and man/machine. This book gives us a fresh look at how our expanding biological views of ourselves and our shared evolutionary history shows us a picture that may not always illumine who and where we are as Christians. Offering up Christian theological views of embodiment, the authors give everyday examples of lives of love, faith, and bodily realities that offer the potential to create new definitions of what it means to be a faith community in an increasingly technological age of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: We are exploring a change in how we think and how we relate to our world as we learn to live as embodied persons, engaging our bodies, listening to them, and listening as well to our Christian traditions of faith. We are on a journey: one that begins with the body, traverses several landscapes, and returns to where we started, our bodies now understood in new ways that point to the paradigm shift we seek. We are persuaded that on this journey of accessing our bodies, we are companions along the journey of God’s incarnation in the world.<br>

  Abstract: Reinhold Niebuhr and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were separated both by ideas and experience, but united in their most important convictions. They differed theologically, a difference apparent in their different interpretations of the Sermon on the Mount. They came from different backgrounds, and they saw the events of the twentieth century from different sides of the Atlantic. Yet despite these differences, each wanted to make a place for faithful action that would change the course of the political crisis through which they were living, and both understood the moral risks involved in that kind of action.

  Author(s) Linde Gesche<br>
  Abstract: As with all the classical pragmatists, Peirce’s interest in the subject of religion is subordinate to his more central questions. What Peirce has to say about God, creation, the church, faith, and love is systematically derived from a philosophy that, having semiotics at its core, spans a broad range of topics, such as mathematics, logic, epistemology, cosmology, linguistics, and occasionally even bridges design and engineering. It is this subsidiary status that, to my mind, lends methodological soundness as well as modernity to Peirce’s reflections, because the clear implication is that religion is not a primary phenomenon but something that develops<br>

The broad form of the problem is reflected in a host of specific observations: What kind of God commands a faithful follower to sacrifice his son? How can just people reconcile their proclamation of a just and merciful God with the God who hardens Pharaoh’s heart, ultimately to the point of imposing the death of all firstborns as one of the plagues used<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: It sought to reach this goal by way of a consequential exegesis of the experience of faith as witnessed in Scripture, and of all other experiences in light of this experience of faith. The intent was that faith would understand God, the world, and us as we, the world, and God are understood by God.<br>

  12  Radical Theology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t6tc">Radical Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: Radical theology develops and reflects on the anaphoric-cataphoric dynamic of faith, looking back to its whither and looking forward to its whence. It describes no new phenomena (experience), but instead describes all phenomena anew (experience with experience). It thus develops a
                     new point of view(standpoint and horizon) from which all phenomena are to be newly seen and understood.<br>

  2  Jenson’s Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: These questions cut to the very heart of Jenson’s theology. In the words of Brevard Childs, “For the Christian church the continuing paradox of its faith lies in its encounter through the Jewish Scriptures with the selfsame divine presence it confesses to have found in the face of Jesus Christ.”³ Insofar as Jenson’s biblical hermeneutic judges the God of Israel to be crucial to the identification of this one God, this identification is simultaneously Trinitarian. Moreover, his influential contribution to the revival of Trinitarian theology is implicitly reliant on a dynamic account of Jesus’ relation to the God of Israel.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the connections between creation and the God of Israel’s consummating and redemptive purposes in the election of a peculiar people. As has been previously argued, Israel knew herself to be contingent, to be a people formed by God’s gracious intention. As a correlate of this understanding, Israel came to apprehend her God as the Creator of all. Reflecting on this “rule of faith” in Israel, Jenson cites 2 Maccabees: “Look at the heavens and the earth … and acknowledge that God made them.”¹ The new thing the New Testament adds, states Jenson, is that creation is for<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t7jq">Into the Far Country</a><br>
  Abstract: Father Zosima’s discourses, following in the wake of Ivan Karamazov’s tirade against the apparent impotence of Christ, detail a life lived out of a particular set of convictions about the world and its ground. Zosima, approaching immanent death, sits with his most faithful friends and declares he wishes to “pour out his soul” to them once more.¹ His discourses, in the first instance, narrate various encounters, only after which we are privy to talks and homilies reflecting on the shape of human life. The integration of narrative and theological reflection is critical to Dostoevsky’s response to Ivan’s accusations. The only<br>

  Abstract: We often take for granted that Western modernity has brought about a secularized, atheistic world, in which religion no longer dominates the public sphere. We are equally convinced that a world once ruled by heteronomy and faith has been developed into a world of autonomy and rationality—in other words, a world whose sense lay outside the world is thought to have given way to a world whose sense is situated within it. Indeed, one cannot deny that religion no longer plays the foundational and regulative role it once did, nor that society is no longer based (at least formally)<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Abstract: There is no task more difficult than to be faithful and true to our creaturely condition. Whether out of fear, blindness, suspicion, arrogance, or rebellion, our abiding temptation is to evade, dissimulate, or distort each other and our place in the world. Rather than patiently and honestly living up to our need before others—by taking full account of, and then honoring, the breadth and depth of the relationships we live through—we deform need into fantasy and remake the world to suit our own desires. Rather than being grateful for the fact that others contribute to our well being<br>

  Book Title: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self-Christology, Ethics, and Formation<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Elliston Clark J.<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s work has persistently challenged Christian consciousness due to both his death at the hands of the Nazis and his provocative prison musings about Christian faithfulness in late modernity. Although understandable given the popularity of both narrative trajectories, such selective focus obscures the depth and fecundity of his overall corpus. Bonhoeffer’s early work, and particularly his Christocentric anthropology, grounds his later expressed commitments to responsibility and faithfulness in a “world come of age." While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Abstract: Today we have villains and saints again, in public view.… That evil appears in the form of light, of beneficence, of faithfulness, of renewal, that it appears in the form of historical necessity, of social justice, is for the commonsense observer a clear confirmation of its profound evilness. Ethical theorists, on the other hand, are blinded by it. With their preconceived concepts they cannot grasp what is real, let alone seriously encounter something whose essence and power they don’t even recognize.<br>

While much debate accompanies claims regarding the continuity of Bonhoeffer’s thought, there are central motifs which pervade his work from his doctoral dissertation to the prison writings. This book suggests that a concern for otherness permeates all of Bonhoeffer’s work. Furthermore, Clark Elliston articulates, drawing on Bonhoeffer, a Christian self-defined by its orientation towards otherness. Taking Bonhoeffer as both the origin and point of return, the text engages Emmanuel Levinas and Simone Weil as dialogue partners who likewise stress the role of the other for self-understanding, albeit in diverse ways. By reading Bonhoeffer “through" their voices, one enhances Bonhoeffer’s already fertile understanding of responsibility.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c84fqp">Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Ethical Self</a><br>
  Abstract: Today we have villains and saints again, in public view.… That evil appears in the form of light, of beneficence, of faithfulness, of renewal, that it appears in the form of historical necessity, of social justice, is for the commonsense observer a clear confirmation of its profound evilness. Ethical theorists, on the other hand, are blinded by it. With their preconceived concepts they cannot grasp what is real, let alone seriously encounter something whose essence and power they don’t even recognize.<br>

  Abstract: The Expression Theory is one of the distinctively modern approaches to art. “Art is the expression of emotion.” Of course earlier writers said a good deal about art and emotion. Plato described art as the feeding and watering of the passions. In the third century the Peri-Hypsous stressed the importance of vehement emotions in the literary work. Renaissance artists were much concerned with the faithful rendering of feeling states in the portrayal of their subjects. Eighteenth century artists and theorists had much to say about the sublime, the feeling of delicious terror. Hegel emphasized the insight art gives into the<br>

  Abstract: Alongside his christocentric pacifism, Yoder is perhaps best known for posing the church as an alternative political body to the nation state. In imitation of the politics of Jesus, Christian communities are to share goods, welcome the excluded, and practice reconciliation, servant leadership, and the priesthood of believers.¹ When it does these things, the church becomes “a proclamation of the lordship of Christ to the powers from whose dominion the church has begun to be liberated.”² Through faithfulness to its master, not compromise, the church fulfills its call “to contribute to the creation of structures more worthy of human society.”³<br>

  Abstract: The conviction that Jesus is the restorative Christ demands a commitment to the justice he articulated. The justice of the restorative Christ is justice with reconciliation, justice with repentance, justice with repair, and justice without retaliation. The Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts portray the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the radical concept of "enemy-love." In conversation with Dietrich Bonhoeffer (Jesus-for-others), John Howard Yoder (a nonviolent Jesus), Miroslav Volf (an embracing Jesus), and Chris Marshall (a compassionate Jesus), Broughton demonstrates what the restorative Christ means for us today. Following the restorative Christ faithfully involves imaginative disciplines (seeing, remembering, and desiring), conversational disciplines (naming, questioning, and forgiving), and embodied disciplines (absorbing, repairing, and embracing).<br>

  7  LUTHER TIMES THREE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdw89">Reading Scripture with the Saints</a><br>
  Abstract: Most standard treatments of Martin Luther’s (1483–1546) biblical commentary move deductively: general propositions are enunciated (e.g., holy Scripture as its own interpreter; all correct interpretation standing under the rule of the analogy of faith, construed christocentrically) and are then bolstered by extracts from the
                  Weimar AusgabeorLuther’s Works.¹ Though such a procedure can be instructive, its total effect is a rather flat presentation of Luther’s exegesis. Perhaps some of the subject’s dimensions—its unity and diversity, constancy and development—would become clearer by adopting a more inductive procedure: examining, comparing, and contrasting three different specimens of Luther’s exposition<br>

  Book Title: Grace for the Injured Self-The Healing Approach of Heinz Kohut<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Randall Robert L.<br>
  Abstract: Grace for the Injured Self shows the reader how the 'self psychology' developed by Heinz Kohut can be an influential theory for pastoral care. The late Kohut affirmed that religion is not only an expression of the self, but can also sustain the self in the alliance between faith and grace, with self psychology and empathy. Cooper and Randall articulately explore Kohut's psychoanalytic perspective of 'self psychology', orientated towards pastoral care for parishioners. The authors ascertain how the human condition is affected by 'self injury', and the relationship between this and the traditional notions of sin. Two interviews with Kohut, never before published in the UK, give the reader unique insights into the psychoanalyst who many regard as the most important figure in psychology since Sigmund Freud.<br>

His pastoral concern was for his audience to come to know God in personal and transformative ways. His focus was on the lived dimension of the Christian faith. The way he sought to minister to his Christian audience was through story. While MacDonald employed a wide range of literary styles, the “parabolic” is a dimension of his writing that has received surprisingly little attention.<br>

  Abstract: A common view about Christianity and politics is that Christians divide up over politics in much the same way as other people. But this is only superficially true and only true of Christians who have thought about politics superficially and in disconnection from their faith. For if one examines the writings of Christian thinkers who have thought long, hard, and theologically about politics, then the consistency of their emphases ever since the dawn of the Industrial Age is extremely striking.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Abstract: Though the Spirit imparts transformative visions to us, it is vital to acknowledge that the imagination is also a reservoir of gruesome and hideous images. The imagination, which can be a fountain of beatific visions, can also be a seabed of monsters spawned by fear, pride, hatred, despair, and even the demonic. What is it that arises within a person and thwarts the Spirit’s new creation in faith, hope, and love? What shadows arise in believers’ perceptions to obscure their vision of God’s recreation of others? Reconciliation is often thwarted because of the natural tendency to perceive the “ other”<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Book Title: The Joshua Delusion?-Rethinking Genocide in the Bible<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Moberly R.W.L.<br>
  Abstract: Many Christians wrestle with biblical passages in which God commands the slaughter of the Canaanites - men, women, and children. The issue of the morality of the biblical God is one of the major challenges for faith today. How can such texts be Holy Scripture? In this bold and innovative book, Douglas Earl grasps the bull by the horns and guides readers to new and unexpected ways of looking at the book of Joshua. Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Abstract: Evangelical Christians are characterized by, among other things, high regard, indeed reverence, for Scripture. The Bible is the word of God. This means, among other things, that the Bible is understood to contain the self-revelation of the one true God, who is made known in many and various ways, and supremely in Jesus Christ. As such, the Bible is to be trusted and what it says is to be carried out – this is the way to live life most fully and faithfully.<br>

Ramsey asks the question in order to consider how the ‘historical truth’ of an Old Testament narrative affects its theological value. In other words, if Jericho was not utterly destroyed as described in Joshua 6, then does the story lack truth and theological value?<br>

Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Author(s) Moberly Walter<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Christians are characterized by, among other things, high regard, indeed reverence, for Scripture. The Bible is the word of God. This means, among other things, that the Bible is understood to contain the self-revelation of the one true God, who is made known in many and various ways, and supremely in Jesus Christ. As such, the Bible is to be trusted and what it says is to be carried out – this is the way to live life most fully and faithfully.<br>

Ramsey devotes a chapter to the question, ‘If Jericho was not Razed, is our Faith in Vain?’¹ The question is a witty allusion to 1 Corinthians 15:14 (if Christ has not been raised, then … your faith has been in vain). Ramsey asks the question in order to consider how the ‘historical truth’ of an Old Testament narrative affects its theological value. In other words, if Jericho was not utterly destroyed as described in Joshua 6, then does the story lack truth and theological value?<br>

  Book Title: Contextual Theology for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tahaafe-Williams Katalina<br>
  Abstract: Scholars from the United States, Latin America, and Oceania reflect in this volume on the importance of contextual theology for the twenty-first century. Contextual theology offers fresh voices from every culture, and not just from the West. It calls for new ways of doing theology that embrace cultural values, but at the same time challenges them to the core. And it opens up new and fresh topics out of which and about which people can theologise. If the church is to be faithful to its mission, it needs to provide a feast at which all can be nourished.<br>

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

  3  Atonement, History, and Meaning from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf285">Jesus and the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: Why should the theologian care about what Jesus of Nazareth thought of his impending death? The question becomes more potent if we phrase is slightly differently: Would it actually make any difference to the Christian faith if its doctrine of the atonement had no basis in the intention of Jesus and was merely a symbolic invention of the early church? An uncritical reaction to this type of question is to answer with an indignant affirmation, since there is more than a little audacity in the suggestion that Jesus’ intention is irrelevant to the Christian proclamation of salvation. However, does the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf285">Jesus and the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter one it was argued that an atonement motif that wished to remain faithful to Christianity would demonstrate a degree of continuity with the meaning that Jesus of Nazareth constituted for his death. That contention still stands, and our analysis of the previous chapter has brought us to the point in which we must now discuss what kind of continuity is, in fact, to be expected. How should we incorporate the meaning that Jesus created for his death into our contemporary presentations? What kind of continuity are we looking for? Are our articulations to be constrained to the categories<br>

  Afterword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf285">Jesus and the Cross</a><br>
  Abstract: What I have attempted to demonstrate herein is the ongoing potential for theology to articulate the meaning of Jesus’ death in a way that remains both faithful to the Christian tradition and yet sensitive to the needs of any given community. Hence, the task has not been to assert any one particular motif or understanding of the cross as
                  theexpression of faithful Christianity. Such an assertion (be it for any particular motif) needs to be rejected, not because individual motifs lack understanding or coherence but because the communication of the saving message of the cross must be received personally,<br>

  Book Title: Justification in a Post-Christian Society-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Gunner Göran<br>
  Abstract: Since the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Lutheran traditions have impacted culture and politics in many societies. At the same time, Lutheran belief has had an effect on personal faith, morality, and ethics. Modern society, however, is quite different from that at the time of the Reformation. How should we evaluate Lutheran tradition in today’s Western multicultural and post-Christian society? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran theological position that can be regarded as reasonable in a society that evidences a considerable weakening of the role of Christianity? What are the challenges raised by cultural diversity for a Lutheran theology and ethics? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran identity in a multicultural society, and is there any fruitful Lutheran contribution to the coexistence of diff erent religious and non-religious traditions in the future?<br>

  Author(s) PETERSON CHERYL M.<br>
  Abstract: In Western theology, the doctrine of the atonement has been dominated by forensic language and the image of the courtroom. Forensic language has been particularly important to a Lutheran understanding of justification: where, by grace through faith, sinners are “declared righteous” on account of Christ. Such language has been criticized, however, for not doing justice to a fuller New Testament understanding of salvation which includes the forgiveness of sins, healing, reconciliation, restoration, and wholeness, and which is experienced communally as well as individually. By so strongly emphasizing forensic imagery in both the doctrine of justification and the atonement, Lutheranism is<br>

  Abstract: Many scholars studying how religious faith develops around the world today emphasize one important transition. Linda Woodhead and Paul Heelas, following the philosopher Charles Taylor, characterize this ongoing transformation as a spiritual revolution.¹ It reveals itself,
                     inter alia, as a growing interest in a multifaceted variety of activities associated with various religious traditions that have one important thing in common. They have traditionally been conceptualized as spiritual training since they have been assumed to contribute to a more flourishing relationship with God or a deeper contact with a spiritual reality. Yoga, pilgrimages, and meditation are examples of such undertakings.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I explore the practice of physicality by some African and European American elders within the Lutheran communion. My claim is that this practice establishes a new model for Lutheran ethics in a multicultural global community. Physicality I define as “the act of intentionally placing one’s body into public spaces as a means of expressing concerns for justice in the world.”¹ At the core of physicality is God’s justifying grace. These elders carried their bodies, anchored by their faith in a justifying God, from the sanctuary of their churches to the streets where God was also active with<br>

  Abstract: This chapter argues that Lutheran theology needs to reflect anew upon the
                  Gestaltsof Protestantism in a post-secular era. On the one hand, we have what I call a Protestantism without blood and flesh, in which faith is understood primarily as an individualized attitude of faith and inner freedom vis-à-vis church and society. On the other hand, we have a Protestantism of blood and flesh which knows that faith, hope, and love can only thrive in and through social forms of embodiment. The church, in this understanding, is a place in which a public understanding of the gospel is cultivated,<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout the previous chapters, there have been numerous references to the church, usually in connection to some task or action that Newbigin believes the church must perform to confront Western culture. While the emphasis thus far has been on the substance of Newbigin’s theology in the face of the challenge of the Enlightenment ideology, it would be incorrect to conclude that what Newbigin envisions is somehow confined to mere words, as important as words are. His theology includes, in fact

  Book Title: Spiritual Complaint-The Theology and Practice of Lament<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bulkeley Tim<br>
  Abstract: Every life, and every land and people, has reasons for lament and complaint. This collection of essays explores the biblical foundations and the contemporary resonances of lament literature. This new work presents a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out of joint are explored. These responses arise from Scripture, from within the liturgy of the church, and from beyond the church; in contemporary life (the racially conflicted land of Aotearoa- New Zealand, secular music concerts and cyber-space). The book thus reflects upon theological and pastoral handling of such experience, as it bridges these different worlds. It brings together in conversation specialists from different fields of academy and church to provide a resource for integrating faith and scholarship in dark places.<br>

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

  CHAPTER 2  The Ancestry of John Wesley’s Covenant Theology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf6d5">From Faith to Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the most direct introductions to the ancestry of Wesley’s covenant theology appears in his sermon “The Righteousness of Faith” published in 1746. His text was Romans 10:5–8, a text from which he had preached at least as early as 1740 and from which he would preach as late as 1789: “For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, The man who doth these things shall live by them. But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh thus, . . . The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is,<br>

  Abstract: It is increasingly apparent that while there was a strong consensus on many aspects of the theological core of covenant theology and general agreement among Calvinists and Arminians alike on the shape of its superstructure (the covenants of works and of grace), the details were subject to nuancing. And the nuancing was soteriologically critical, as evidenced in the long-running conversations Wesley joined in progress as he sought to stake out the theological foundations of a Methodist morphology of conversion. His regard for the authority of Scripture, his commitment to preserve the Reformation doctrine of justification by faith along with his<br>

  Abstract: In a sermon written just three years before his death, Wesley spoke about a distinction between what he called “species of faith.” He emphasized that this was “a point of no small importance” and was worthy of his ongoing effort to make the distinction and its implications “a little plainer.”¹ The distinction he was highlighting was that between “the faith of a servant” and “the faith of a son.” It is significant not only that Wesley viewed the distinction as important but that he was convinced that the biblical contrast between servant and son most adequately conveyed the

  Abstract: Part 1 has established that the first three named women of Matthew’s Gospel are characterized within their Hebrew narratives not in terms of their sinfulness or scandalous sexual activity but by their virtues of righteousness, faith, and loyalty. This short chapter will argue that righteousness, faith, and loyalty are three central aspects of the Matthean Jesus’ teaching in relation to discipleship. It is therefore significant that these themes first appear in the stories of Tamar (righteousness), Rahab (faith and loyalty), and Ruth (loyalty).

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf9rs">Contextual Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: The rise of the “new Christianity” has led Christian theologians to retrieve insights within Christian traditions that are helpful as the faith takes root and forms new and vital communities and practices. According to these traditions, good theology is not a search for universal truths that can be applied in all contexts and times, but rather an engagement with the lives of peoples and communities. The eschatological framework of Christian thinking and the centrality of theological theories of God’s grace ensure the openness of Christian thinking to new contexts. The creation of new Christian communities is a social and cultural<br>

In time the search for insights from Christian thinking led to engagement. Theologians such as Karl Barth, Paul Lehmann, and Visser ’T Hooft addressed the theoretical side of problems that had to be faced, such as the form an ecumenical theology can take and the relation between dogma and ethics. The key, it was believed, is found in the deceptively simple principle that faith informs theological<br>

  Abstract: Historical and social realities provide textual meaning with its temporal and cultural limits and possibilities. We experience our world because we are part of a world. For our faith to have meaning it must be meaningful in a particular historical, cultural, and social context. The question of whether and how the meaning of the beliefs and practices of Christian faith can be translated into those that share the same truth in other cultures becomes acute. For the claims of Christian conviction to be true they must be commensurable. All this leads to an assertion: once the faith has been shared,<br>

  Book Title: The Helping Relationship-Healing and Change in Community Context<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rovers Martin<br>
  Abstract: The increased use of and emphasis on managed care, manualized treatment protocols, evidence-based treatments and quick treatments have marginalized the role of the helping relationship in the helping professions. This shift has sparked a debate within the helping professions over whether the helping relationship or technique is primarily responsible for healing and change.
      The Helping Relationshipweighs in on this debate, arguing that healing and change always take place within the context of relationships and that the relationship is more important than the technique. While recognizing the value of techniques, the authors valorize the helping relationship, considering it in unconventional contexts, such as formal education, supervision, and faith communities to show its flexibility and efficacy. This alternative approach adds a new perspective on the helping relationship debate, shedding new light on the roles of relationship and technique in the healing process.<br>

For instance, his project of a universal

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Abstract: The heart of Christian theology is Christology. Christology can be de-fined as theological reflection on the question of who Jesus was—and is—for Christians. The multiplicity of Christological titles in the New Testament—Messiah, Lord, savior, prophet, high priest, Son of God, and so on—all qualify each other and become reinterpreted in light of the Christ event. Together they express the centrality and sui generis nature—in short, the uniqueness—of Jesus for Christian faith.

  Abstract: The majority of Christian soteriologies written in context of religious diversity have focused on the possibility of salvation for those who are not Christian. Traditionally, these theologies of religious diversity have been divided into three major paradigms: exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism.
                  Exclusivismmaintains that salvation is given only through Christ to those that explicitly embrace faith, the Church, and/or Christianity. The assertion that there is no salvation apart from the church serves as a classical articulation of this position.

  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends.

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Each Sunday, many Christians find themselves faithfully reciting the above words of belief embedded in the Nicene Creed. As if what is being stated is a self-evident truth, this phrase is echoed almost unquestioningly all over the globe. Yet the expansiveness of the statement, which includes an ambiguous interplay between things visible and invisible, placed as a poetic chiasm paralleling that of heaven and earth, might haunt us. Whereas one might find comfort in things divinely made being heavenly, would not their tangible manifestation in time and space offer an occasion to wonder about such divine makings? If we take<br>

  Abstract: Rory Block, the great blues singer, poses the question of evil in her wonderful song, “Faithless World.”¹ In her characteristic way, she evokes the poignancy of suffering, leaving the question of meaning visceral and open. She identifies us as “travelers” in this place of “many wonders” and “tears.” Her hard road has taught her that suffering is not punishment but rather a task given to the “enlightened,” a “lesson to be learned,” which each individual must learn for themselves. This “faithless world” is as, Jeffery Long puts it, a kind of moral gymnasium; it is a place of suffering against<br>

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

  Book Title: Body or the Soul?-Religion and Culture in a Quebec Parish, 1736-1901<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

  Abstract: I do not think it a stretch to say that translating Native verbal arts occupies an unseen boundary with its comings and goings between what is actually said, what is interpreted, then invented out of those words, and the written text that is presented as a faithful rendition of what was originally stated or sung. And while translation is of course reliant upon getting the words straight, I think the heart of translation is centrally about re-expressing the rhythms and movements expressed by those words.

  Abstract: The central problem of translation, namely, the competition between faithfulness to meaning and preservation of form, grows more attenuated as translation moves from simple conveyance of information to artistic forms. Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended. The translator may also have to deal with problems of grammatical structure: a language may lack a particular verbal<br>

During that ceremony, an Indigenous elder from Greenland sang a healing song passed down from his great-great-grandmother. He sang it for the sculptor who hoped to create a healing garden for children on the site, which he envisioned as a medicine wheel of sculptures by Indigenous artists.

  Book Title: Taking Hold of the Real-Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Profound Worldliness of Christianity<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Harvey Barry<br>
  Abstract: Dietrich Bonhoeffer writes in one of his last prison letters that he had “come to know and understand more and more the profound this-worldliness of Christianity." In Taking Hold of the Real, Barry Harvey engages in constructive conversation with Bonhoeffer, contending that the “shallow and banal this-worldliness" of modern society is ordered to a significant degree around the social technologies of religion, culture, and race. These mechanisms displace human beings from their traditional connections with particular locales, and relocate them in their “proper places" as determined by the nation-state and capitalist markets. Christians are called to participate in the profound this-worldliness that breaks into the world in the apocalyptic action of Jesus Christ, a form of life that requires discipline and an understanding of death and resurrection. The church is a sacrament of this new humanity, performing for all to hear the polyphony of life that was prefigured in the Old Testament and now is realised in Christ. Unable to find a faithful form of this-worldliness in wartime Germany, Bonhoeffer joined the conspiracy against Hitler, a decision aptly contrasted with a small French church that, prepared by its life together over many generations, saved thousands of Jewish lives.<br>

  Abstract: One of our most distinguished thinkers, Adriaan Peperzak has masterfully explored the connections between philosophy, ethics, religion, and the social and historical contexts of human experience. He offers a personal gathering of influences on his own work as guides to the uses of philosophy in our search for sense and meaning. In concise, direct, and deeply felt chapters, Peperzak moves from Plato, Plotinus, and the Early Christian theologians to Anselm, Bonaventure, Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, Hegel, and Levinas. Throughout these carefully linked essays, he touches on the fundamental ideas-from reason and faith to freedom and tradition-that inform the questions his work has consistently addressed, most specifically those concerning philosophy as a practice.<br>

  Abstract: Even a superficial reading of the Gospels will suffice to convince the reader that incarnation is the alpha and—as resurrection of the flesh—the omega of Christian faith. And with the body, involvement in the human world and its history is part of God’s self-revelation in his Word through the Spirit. The Christian community, whose faith is corporeal, communicative, communitarian, and sacramental, participates in this involvement. None of its activities is possible in the ether of incorporeal ghosts or spirits. All prophecies and fulfillments are facts of language; the entire liturgy is visible, tactile, and resounding; rituals have the<br>

  Abstract: Unless the claim that one speaks in the name of Christian faith is confined to explications of ecclesiastical dogma, it is likely to be confused with the personal opinion of an individual marked by particular experiences and circumstances. However, even the official doctrine of a Church does not escape the law of historical concretization, according to which all dogma particularizes what it tries to establish by restricting its validity to detennined epochs and milieus. Indeed, Christianity cannot be other than a mixture composed of “the purity of the Gospel,” elements that belong to a culture, particular perspectives that hold sway<br>

In contrast to those of his colleagues in theology and philosophy who proclaim at every turn that the human mind cannot know God, let alone prove his existence, Hegel agrees with Anselm that genuine faith not merely pennits but requires the believer to seek to understand what he believes. 2.

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

  Book Title: Patrick Modiano-Second Edition<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Author(s) Odell Margaret S.<br>
  Abstract: Ezekiel 16, the problematic narrative of Jerusalem as YHWH’s adopted daughter and faithless wife, has been richly illuminated for contemporary readers by way of postcolonial theory and postmodern literary approaches to metaphor and gender.¹ These interpretations have helped modern readers move from initial feelings of revulsion and shock at this tale of YHWH’s violent punishment of daughter/wife Jerusalem to a more complex assessment of its symbolic treatment of the city’s destruction. To be sure, nothing can dispel the tale’s unsettling violence; nevertheless, it has become possible to appreciate how the narrative’s use of metaphor and gender allowed its ancient readers<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h1htfd">Bible through the Lens of Trauma</a><br>
  Author(s) Clark Peter Yuichi<br>
  Abstract: When people endure times of crisis or trauma, they often search for meaning and hope by engaging in a bidirectional reading of texts. One direction involves hearing, reading, or witnessing the stories of others in analogous circumstances. Doing so can help people to know that they are not alone in their suffering, thus fulfilling Donne’s axiom that “no man is an island, entire of itself.”¹ The other direction points toward texts and rituals in one’s religious faith and spiritual practices, seeking a linkage between one’s own story and a larger, transcendent story: one that recounts what is sacred or ultimate.<br>

  Book Title: New Thinking in Islam-The Jihad for Democracy, Freedom and Women’s Rights<br>
  Publisher: The Gingko Library<br>
  Author(s): Ormsby Eric<br>
  Abstract: In
      Rethinking Islam, Katajun Amirpur argues that the West's impression of Islam as a backward-looking faith, resistant to post-Enlightenment thinking, is misleading and-due to its effects on political discourse-damaging. Introducing readers to key thinkers and activists-such as Abu Zaid, a free-thinking Egyptian Qur'an scholar; Abdolkarim Soroush, an academic and former member of Khomeini's Cultural Revolution Committee; and Amina Wadud, an American feminist who was the first woman to lead the faithful in Friday Prayer-Amirpur reveals a powerful yet lesser-known tradition of inquiry and dissent within Islam, one that is committed to democracy and human rights. By examining these and many other similar figures' ideas, she reveals the many ways they reject fundamentalist assertions and instead call for a diversity of opinion, greater freedom, and equality of the sexes.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hd17z7">The Resounding Soul</a><br>
  Author(s) Wilson L. C.<br>
  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  TWO  Problems with the Contrast between Circular and Linear Views of Time in the Interpretation of Ancient and Early Medieval History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hjb0d8">Supper at Emmaus</a><br>
  Abstract: More than a generation ago, Arnaldo Momigliano, in attacking many conventional contrasts between, for instance, a so-called Jewish and a so-called Greek view of time, argued that the contrast between a Greek or pagan circular time and a Jewish-Christian linear time could not be sustained.¹ Of Momigliano’s contemporaries, perhaps no one more persistently had made and was to continue to make this contrast than Mircea Eliade, who presented Judaism and Christianity as transcending the celestial cycles of ancient religion: “repetition was transcended, for the first time, by Judeo-Christianism, which introduced a new category into religious experience: the category of
                  faith.”²<br>

  FIVE  Setting Boundaries: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1hjb0d8">Supper at Emmaus</a><br>
  Abstract: The history of toleration has no beginning. Tolerance and intolerance, the instincts to welcome and to exclude, have been practiced by each individual and every people. From its beginnings Judaism regarded itself as the religion of a chosen people that drew lines of separation between itself and others (especially in the matter of purity) while also welcoming the stranger. Christianity and Islam acted similarly. This chapter explores particular ways in which Judaism’s approach to the problem of tolerating those with whom it could not comfortably live a shared life influenced its daughter faiths, especially Christianity.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

In this poem, “On Being Brought from Africa to America,” she expresses her gratitude that the slave trade provided her with access to the Christian salvation and faith that she would not have had, nor indeed desired, had she remained in Africa. By utilizing the word “brought,” she exposes a positive teleology for her experience of the slave trade. It simultaneously reveals her<br>

Missionaries, though fired by zeal for the Christian faith, love of God, and concern for humankind, often confused Christianity with their own Western cultures. Wittingly or unwittingly, they frequently worked hand in hand with national governments as the humanitarian arm in colonial conquests. They could show deep compassion for those they sought to “save,” while exhibiting the attitudes of paternalistic superiority that were current in their day. It should be little wonder that after five hundred years of missionization the number of Native American adherents<br>

  Abstract: Whether viewed as the breakdown of civilization, as its ultimate and most ennobling expression, or as something in between, war has always been fraught with possibility and peril for religious leaders, activists, and people of faith. War amplifies passions and exposes societal rifts even as it generates calls for unity and narratives of common experience. War offers the hope of transforming hostile nations and peoples politically, culturally, and religiously, but also threatens to poison relations between victor and vanquished, liberator and liberated. War creates mission fields and troubles those very same fields.<br>

  Abstract: In
      Love and Christian Ethics, nearly two dozen leading experts analyze and assess the meaning of love from a wide range of perspectives. Chapters are organized into three areas: influential sources and exponents of Western Christian thought about the ethical significance of love, perennial theoretical questions attending that consideration, and the implications of Christian love for important social realities. Contributors bring a richness of thought and experience to deliver unprecedentedly broad and rigorous analysis of this central tenet of Christian ethics and faith. William Werpehowski provides an afterword on future trajectories for this research.Love and Christian Ethicsis sure to become a benchmark resource in the field.<br>

The love commands provide a substantive foundation for these more complex resources, undergirding their authority and informing efforts to observe them faithfully in ongoing life practices. This essay focuses on distinctive yet overlapping treatments of the love commands contained in the book of Deuteronomy and in Matthew’s presentation of Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount, with selective references to related materials in other biblical texts.

  Author(s) SCALON ROBERTO<br>
  Abstract: The Italian biotechnological sector has become a battlefield between the Catholic Church and the various actors who disagree with its positions. They represent various power and knowledge subsystems in a society which has become complex. The conflict also grows out of the paradox of a society – like the Italian – which is partly secularized but can still portray itself as majority Catholic. From the social point of view, Catholicism continues to be the
                  basso continuoof collective conscience, although among the Italian population many attitudes and behaviours in the field of faith and religious practice have deviated – either discreetly or decisively<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I fleshed out three distinctive aspects of the Cruciform Hermeneutic. Yet, a more nuanced understanding will prove helpful to fully appreciate the manner in which this hermeneutic will interpret the variety of violent divine portraits we find in the OT. Inasmuch as Christian reflections on all things pertaining to God must be done in dialogue with the wider body of Christ, I believe the most faithful and effective way to accomplish this is to place the Cruciform Hermeneutic in dialogue with the contemporary Theological Interpretation of Scripture (TIS) movement, for, as will become clear, my hermeneutical<br>

With this in place, this chapter will demonstrate how the Principle of Redemptive Withdrawal, which is centered on this concept of “wrath,” is confirmed throughout the written witness to God’s covenantal faithfulness. I will begin with a review of various ways this principle is reflected in the teachings and ministry of Jesus as well as in the other sections of the NT. I will then demonstrate<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Breaking Bodies: from:

  Author(s) Murphy Michael P.<br>
  Abstract: George Bernanos, the great French writer (or “scribbler,” as he called himself) of the twentieth-century French Catholic literary revival, wrote in the “Sermon from an Agnostic on the Feast of St. Therese of Lisieux” episode from his 1938 work
                  The Great Cemeteries under the Moonthe following: “Because you do not live your faith, your faith has ceased to be a living thing. It has become abstract—bodiless. Perhaps we shall find that the disincarnation of the Word of God is the real cause of all our misfortune.”¹ This propensity—the tendency to idealize experience and “disincarnate” theological phenomena from<br>

  Abstract: One of Paul Meyer’s colleagues has shown us how important is the issue of finding a “coherent” Paul among the Apostle’s varied responses to the “contingencies” of his situation.² Yet, for anyone who still hopes to find some guidance from the Bible in trying to form a Christian life today, there is a more urgent question: not whether Paul is consistent, but whether God is. This question is at the center of Romans 9–11, and Paul Meyer has clearly articulated it: If God’s action in Christ was as radical as Paul (and subsequent Christian faith) claims, “what then becomes<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn65">The Spirit of Early Christian Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: ALL THE FIGURES portrayed in this book prayed regularly, and their thinking was never far removed from the church’s worship. Whether the task at hand was the defense of Christian belief to an outsider, the refutation of the views of a heretic, or the exposition of a passage from the Bible, their intellectual work was always in service of praise and adoration of the one God. “This is the Catholic faith,” begins an ancient creed, “that we worship one God in Trinity and Trinity in Unity.” Often their treatises ended with a doxology to God, as in Augustine’s

  Chapter 7  The Reasonableness of Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn65">The Spirit of Early Christian Thought</a><br>
  Abstract: THE CENSORIOUS CHARGE that Christian thinking relies on faith, not reason, is as old as the church itself. As early as the mid second century the physician and philosopher Galen complained that it was pointless to engage Christians in discussion because they never give arguments for what they believe. They only make appeals to “God commanded” or “God spoke.” In
                  True Doctrine,written about the same time, Celsus echoed Galen’s accusation: “Some Christians,” he wrote, “do not even want to give or to receive a reason for what they believe, and use expressions such as ‘Do not ask questions, just<br>

As phenomenologists, we need to follow the higher levels of theoretical thinking, but need to attend to its beginning in originary experience. Theory cannot possibly eliminate the sense found in originary intuition, which prescribes the norm by which all subsequent theory must<br>

  Book Title: Abraham's Children-Liberty and Tolerance in an Age of Religious Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): CLARK KELLY JAMES<br>
  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

Among other things, it generated a substantive open letter to the pope signed by thirty-eight respected Muslim clerics—a document that itself is carefully reasoned and gracious. At a time when the rising tide of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism is being met by increasing fear and stereotyping in the West, any form of dialogue is cause for<br>

We have not come out of mere antiquarian curiosity, but in search of parallels to our own time and the insights we can glean from them. As an organization interested in the cross-fertilization of art and faith, and the ways that these two fundamental human experiences can renew lives and communities, we believe that the Renaissance offers a model of cultural transformation that is highly relevant to the present.<br>

It is also the kind of poem that, once you fully absorb it, tends to follow you around everywhere, interpreting your life—it possesses that sort of metaphysical urgency.<br>

  L’ambivalenza delle Weltanschauungen tra ragione ed esistenza from:

  Abstract: This paper aims to understand the meaning and role that Jaspers attributes to worldviews. By analysing the nature of the
                  Weltanschauungen, the paper shows how Jaspers, inspired by Dilthey, alludes to a fundamental stratum of the Weltanschauung that goes beyond every objective construction, every shell (Gehäuse) and every doctrine, and which is identified with the process of the existential experience. The antinomicity of the lived process and the ambiguity that characterises the worldviews becomes clearer where Jaspers introduces the notion of limit situation. By analysing the relationship between theWeltanschauungenand the philosophical faith, the paper shows that theWeltanschauungen<br>

  Abstract: In a lecture of January 7, 1668, to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, Philippe de Champaigne famously criticized Nicolas Poussin for his failure to adhere faithfully to sacred history in his painting of
                  Rebecca and Eliezerof ca. 1648 (in the Louvre), specifically for not including the camels mentioned in the biblical text, which deserved to be shown, he said, in order to prove the exactitude and the fidelity of the painter in a true subject.¹ Champaigne might well have attended Sebastien Bourdon’s lecture on Poussin’sChrist Healing the Blindof 1650 (also in the Louvre; see<br>

  Abstract: Scholars of Wallace Stevens have long recognized that his poetics is bound up with the loss of religious faith. The standard critical picture is that, like many Victorians before him, Stevens gave up certain consolatory beliefs in the “supernatural” and looked to poetry to fill the vacuum of “meaning.” Stevens himself wrote bluntly in a letter of mid-career: “[I]t is a habit of mind with me to be thinking of some substitute for religion” (L, 348 ).

  Author(s): Bowen Deborah C.<br>
  Abstract: Highlighting the wide variety of ethical concerns considered by writers such as Timothy Findley, Thomas King, Carol Shields, Julian Barnes, A.S. Byatt, and Salman Rushdie, Deborah Bowen makes the case for a new category of "postmodern realism" and shows how contemporary stories about "the real" and "the good" are constructed. Applying theoretical insights from Emmanuel Levinas and Mikhail Bakhtin, Bowen investigates categories of postmodern realism such as magic realism, parody, and metafiction while laying the groundwork for Christian readings of a medium that is often perceived as largely irreligious. An illuminating study of well-known contemporary writers, Stories of the Middle Space is a critically nuanced and methodologically innovative work that reads the postmodern from a faith-based perspectives to create new literary insights.<br>

  Abstract: The story of the binding of Isaac both challenges and inspires people who seek to live faithfully in relationship with a God who surpasses our understanding. Combinding the history of exegesis with a theological exploration of the meaning of faith in the face of suffering, this book examines Luther‘s and Kierkegaard‘s lively--and very different--interpretations of Genesis 22 to demonstrate how the way we read the Bible is crucial to the life of faith.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1tm7gw5">Faith in a Hidden God</a><br>
  Abstract: Luther’s concept of faith as trust in God’s promises stands in opposition to the medieval categories of faith in which he had been schooled, particularly those views that posited faith to be contingent upon a particular knowledge on the part of the believer. Medieval theologians, reading the Abrahamic narratives in light of the Pauline claim that Abraham was justified by faith, attempted to define precisely the kind of faith that had justified Abraham (and by extension promises to justify Christians): unformed or formed by love; acquired by works or infused by God; implicit or explicit in the mind’s assent to<br>

After an examination of the historical, social, and intellectual forces that influenced Kierkegaard during the time of the pseudonymous authorship, the chapter engages in a close reading ofFear and Trembling, examining the ways in which Johannes de Silentio uses variations, silences, and obscurities to enhance the difficulties and complexities inherent in the story.

  Abstract: The performative dimensions of Luther and Kierkegaard’s readings of Genesis 22 have been evaluated in light of each thinker’s concept of faith as perceptual movement in relation to the hiddenness and revelation of God. Such performative movement can be called anagogical when it moves the reader into deeper understanding of God. Both the
                  Lectures on GenesisandFear and Tremblingmove their readers in ways that resemble a movement of faith: toward a trustworthy God for the former, and into the abyss of God’s ineffability for the latter. Not every reader will be moved in such a way, but both<br>

  Abstract: The marks left on the contemporary history of Christianity by the international ecumenical movement of the twentieth century are undeniable. Among the marks deserving to be remembered and celebrated are, first, the search for an answer to the demands of unity in the missionary movement, striving “so that the world may believe”; second, the articulations around “practical Christianity” that would overcome historical doctrinal divides; third, the doctrinal dialogue in efforts to produce “faith and order”; and fourth, the joint actions of Christian youth and educators from different churches, confessions, and regional Christian associations.<br>

  Abstract: Faced with situations of injustice and human suffering, people with genuine faith cannot remain indifferent. They must take a stand and engage in movements or struggles for justice and for overcoming oppressive situations and suffering. Such engagement breaks away from the divide established by the modern world between public and private spheres, the latter being the one where religion should play its role. That is why Christian groups engaging in those struggles feel the need for theologies that are not restrained by the modern relegation of religion to the private sphere and eternal life; they search for reasons for their<br>

  Abstract: Religion played a crucial role in European expansionism. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the rise of the Spanish Empire, fostered by the myth of the Reconquista, blended nationalist and religious motives. According to that myth, “Spain was born as a nation convinced that God had entrusted it with the defense of the Catholic faith against all Muslims, Jews, heretics, and other unbelievers.”¹ Under that banner, the Spaniards invaded and explored the “New World … convinced that this was a sacred trust so that they could bring their religion to the benighted people in these lands.”²<br>

  Abstract: In Christianity, we move through cultural contexts often. Whenever we recite scripture or sing hymns penned long ago, listen to sermons or read the Bible privately or aloud, we are moving through cultural contexts. The study of World Christianity is interested in the myriad of expressions of the Christian faith as seen across several continents. It is interested in the cultural contexts through which people express their belief in God.¹ Similarly, the field of public religion is interested in the expressions of religious beliefs through behaviors that “have a direct bearing on public order.”² The common thread that connects these<br>

Here is compressed a seminal confession of faith that often serves in those moments as the preeminent word of pastoral care.

  Abstract: Modern critics, in discussing neoclassical genres, have insisted on the rigidity of forms, while acknowledging that eighteenth-century critics disagreed about and poets seemed to diverge from this “rigidity.” Austin Warren wrote: “That genres are distinct—and also should be kept distinct—is a general article of Neo-Classical faith. But if we look to Neo-Classical criticism for definition of genre or method of distinguishing genre from genre, we find little consistency or even awareness of the need for a rationale.”¹ James Sutherland, in

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wq8z40">The Three Dynamisms of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: In their journey toward faith or toward a more mature faith, a good number of hikers walk with two legs. The first leg is human hope; the second leg is the biblical message addressed to humanity. Trekkers who, without having responded yet to the summons of the Bible, are nevertheless seriously thinking about the human predicament, may be considered (from a Christian perspective) as walking with one leg. Of them, Clement of Alexandria wrote, “Those who do anything or utter anything without the word of truth are like people struggling to walk without a foothold.”¹ By contrast, many of the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter introduces a medieval thinker, Thomas Aquinas, and investigates how he understands several central aspects of the act of faith. Since it is very important to take account of the affective side of faith, we shall begin with his views on the interaction between faith and love. Thereafter, I shall vindicate the centrality of the First Truth, which intellectually grounds faith in a God whose presence, self-revelation, and self-communication are real. Next, we shall ponder the way Aquinas assesses the role and compass of human reason in the faith experience. We shall end with a description of what he<br>

  Abstract: Throughout his life, John Henry Newman (1801–90) was concerned with the challenge that the rationalism of his time, which he often called “liberalism,” addressed to Christianity. In this chapter, therefore, we shall concentrate on aspects of his thought that shed light on his account of the faith process—a process he viewed as much broader and deeper than any rationalist methodology.

  Abstract: Bernard Lonergan (1904–84) was, in my estimation, the premier Roman Catholic theologian of the twentieth century. Basically a Thomist, he nevertheless displayed remarkable creativity in the areas of epistemology, method, and historical consciousness.¹ His contribution to a theology of faith hinges upon two conversions: religious and intellectual. Accordingly, after briefly characterizing a third kind of conversion, the moral one, which is less important here for a theology of faith, this chapter shows the impact of religious and intellectual conversion.² The first two sections discuss the interaction between

  Abstract: We have listened to reflections on the drama of hope, to the Bible, to exegetes, and to a good number of philosophers and theologians, principally Thomas Aquinas, John Henry Newman, and Bernard Lonergan. So I assume my readers are ready for an actualization of Christian faith in accordance with the concerns, hesitancies, worries, and questions about affective fulfillment, the meaning of human life, and truth, which were described in the introduction and in chapter 1. With respect to Lonergan’s levels of intentionality, I situate affective fulfillment on the fourth level, meaning on the second, and truth on the third.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wq8z40">The Three Dynamisms of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: In their journey toward faith or toward a more mature faith, a good number of hikers walk with two legs. The first leg is human hope; the second leg is the biblical message addressed to humanity. Trekkers who, without having responded yet to the summons of the Bible, are nevertheless seriously thinking about the human predicament, may be considered (from a Christian perspective) as walking with one leg. Of them, Clement of Alexandria wrote, “Those who do anything or utter anything without the word of truth are like people struggling to walk without a foothold.”¹ By contrast, many of the<br>

  Abstract: This chapter introduces a medieval thinker, Thomas Aquinas, and investigates how he understands several central aspects of the act of faith. Since it is very important to take account of the affective side of faith, we shall begin with his views on the interaction between faith and love. Thereafter, I shall vindicate the centrality of the First Truth, which intellectually grounds faith in a God whose presence, self-revelation, and self-communication are real. Next, we shall ponder the way Aquinas assesses the role and compass of human reason in the faith experience. We shall end with a description of what he<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fjn">Toward a Global Civil Society</a><br>
  Author(s) Nardin Terry<br>
  Abstract: There is an ambiguity in the idea of “civil society” as the arena of private economic and social relations, rather than of government. First, there is the idea that these relations are freely chosen. Civil society, as Michael Walzer puts it, is “the space of uncoerced human association.” But second, there is the idea that these relations depend upon shared values. Civil society is therefore also “the set of relational networks—formed for the sake of family, faith, interest, and ideology—that fill this space.” … The idea of civil society, then, can receive both liberal and communitarian interpretation, depending<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: For a generation and more, the contribution of Christian theology to interreligious understanding has been a subject of debate. Some think of theological perspectives are of themselves inherently too narrow to support interreligious learning, and argue for an approach that is neutral or, on a more popular level, grounded simply open-minded direct experience. In response, comparative theology argues that theology, as faith seeking understanding, offers a vital perspective and a way of advancing interreligious dialogue, aided rather than hindered by commitments; theological perspectives can both complement and step beyond the study of religions by methods detached and merely neutral. Thus comparative theology has been successful in persuading many that interreligious learning from one faith perspective to another is both possible and worthwhile, and so the work of comparative theology has become more recognized and established globally. With this success there has come to the fore new challenges regarding method: How does one do comparative theological work in a way that is theologically grounded, genuinely open to learning from the other, sophisticated in pursuing comparisons, and fruitful on both the academic and practical levels?<br>

  Book Title: Vatican II and Beyond-The Changing Mission and Identity of Canadian Women Religious<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world. Over the last five decades, women religious have engaged with the council’s reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeding the expectations of the Church. Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  CHAPTER 6  CREDIBILITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27h24">Fundamental Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: The credibility or believability of divine revelation is a property that follows from its nature. God does not speak unless he can be heard, and he does not command unless he can be obeyed. The actuality of hearing what God says is the topic of the chapter on faith. Between the speaking and the hearing, however, there is this third thing, the credibility of what is said: the ability of revelation to be heard as what it really is, its capacity to be taken as true by the hearer.<br>

  Abstract: In the introduction to the previous chapter, it was observed that the word of God received in faith has a certain preeminence over all other words: it judges and orders them. That is, the knowledge of God in faith is a higher knowledge than any other, both as to its content and as to its way of knowing. As to its content: it tells us of the intimate things of God, his triune life which otherwise we could not know, and of his will to invite us to share this life, and of the way to this goal.

  CHAPTER 5  PRAEAMBULA FIDEI from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27h24">Fundamental Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: We come now to the second part of this book. The first part considered God speaking a word to us. Now we turn to our hearing of that word in faith. Before faith, however, there are the

  CHAPTER 6  CREDIBILITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27h24">Fundamental Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: The credibility or believability of divine revelation is a property that follows from its nature. God does not speak unless he can be heard, and he does not command unless he can be obeyed. The actuality of hearing what God says is the topic of the chapter on faith. Between the speaking and the hearing, however, there is this third thing, the credibility of what is said: the ability of revelation to be heard as what it really is, its capacity to be taken as true by the hearer.<br>

  CHAPTER 7  FAITH from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1z27h24">Fundamental Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: In the introduction to the previous chapter, it was observed that the word of God received in faith has a certain preeminence over all other words: it judges and orders them. That is, the knowledge of God in faith is a higher knowledge than any other, both as to its content and as to its way of knowing. As to its content: it tells us of the intimate things of God, his triune life which otherwise we could not know, and of his will to invite us to share this life, and of the way to this goal. As to<br>

  A Word about the Translation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zqrmtj">The Spirit of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: In translating Congar’s words, we have tried to remain faithful both to the substance and to the style of the French text from which we worked. Our aim has been to make Congar’s ideas and his enthusiasm accessible to contemporary readers. To the extent that it has been possible to do so, we have supplemented Congar’s notes by giving complete publication data and by noting, in square brackets, where passages to which he refers would be found in English translations. For those writings of St. Thomas Aquinas that are cited frequently enough to appear in our list of abbreviations, we<br>

  3  The Spirit Is the Source of Life in Us Personally and in the Church from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zqrmtj">The Spirit of God</a><br>
  Abstract: Having recalled the fact of an uncritical but constant claim that the Spirit
                  of Godis at work in us and in the world, I have highlighted the main difficulties to which this claim gives rise. This sequence is well known to believers: after a time of peaceful possession of the faith, they become aware of challenges to it. If not doubt, at least an ongoing questioning—what St. Thomas called thecogitatio—is a part of the faith. It is the passport into what Paul Ricoeur calls the second naiveté,¹ which is more or less the state of a<br>

  ARTICLE 1  Theology of the Holy Spirit and Theology of History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zqrmtj">The Spirit of God</a><br>
  Abstract: First of all, I must clarify the meaning of some terms. “Pneumatology” designates the ensemble of actions proper to the Holy Spirit (or appropriated to the Holy Spirit) in the life of the Church and of the world. It is obvious that what I will say on this subject makes sense only if one presupposes the traditional Christian faith. But that is true, too, for “theology of history.” This expression designates, in the most general way, a consideration of history from God’s point of view in so far as we know it, that is, in the light not only of<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Book Title: Reasoning from Faith-Fundamental Theology in Merold Westphal’s Philosophy of Religion<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SANDS JUSTIN<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

However, this was only a partial answer since it merely addresses how one assents to, or otherwise accepts, faith.

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

We contend that in this moment feminist phenomenology is well positioned to take a leading role, not simply in terms of consolidating existing feminist methodologies but also in engaging the difficult task of thinking through the actual in the fullness of its relational, agential, ontological, experiential, and fleshly being, thereby opening up future possibilities.

  THE ETHICS OF NARRATIVE AT TRENT UNIVERSITY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hp5q">Architecture, Ethics, and Technology</a><br>
  Author(s) HENRIQUEZ GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: The incomprehensible rate of change of the modern world brings with it the more-than-uneasy feeling that the outcome is unknown, that doom is at hand. The threat once represented by the atomic bomb has been replaced by the ecological crisis and the population explosion. We need somehow to restore faith in the future of the human race, both physically and spiritually. Canada’s multicultural society could be called an excellent example of the homogenization of values and, at the same time, a mosaic of values. As we await the new unified “world order” of trade and tariffs, our country’s cultural values<br>

  VI  Christian Martyrdom and Christian Humanism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: For various complicated motives (sometimes too unpleasant to discuss, even when they are suspected), Christianity has been often regarded (and sometimes still is) by many as a religion of victory, of triumph, of battles won, and of domination (early on Origen felt obliged to combat this erroneous understanding). Such an impression was encouraged among other things by the impressively swift spread of this faith on all continents of our planet: in its first few centuries around the Mediterranean basin; thereafter for another few centuries throughout Europe, among the immigrant tribes massively settling here; finally, during the latest half-millennium, on all<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: The case of Ernst Jünger, one of the greatest German writers of the twentieth century, is highly significant in connection with the studies undertaken in the present book. Above all, he is significant because his life and the period of his writing career cover an unusually long time, virtually the whole of the twentieth century, and his artistic sensibility responded faithfully to all the changes experienced during this time. The author’s responses were highly symptomatic not least because they focused on three points that are fully relevant to our stream of ideas. One of these is the dialectic between alienating<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The origins of the 
                  sensus fidelium lie in the origins of the church. The first disciples’ encounters with Jesus begin a process of interpreting his teaching, his actions, and his identity, but there is nevertheless a certain misunderstanding of him during his pre-Easter ministry. However, after his death and resurrection, and with the coming of the Holy Spirit, full Christian faith in him begins. Now, from the new perspective of Easter, and with a sense of being guided in their understanding and interpretation by a special gift from the Holy Spirit, the believing disciples of the Crucified and Risen One<br>

  CHAPTER 1  The Holy Spirit and Revelation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Lumen Gentium 12 teaches that all believers possess “a supernatural sense of the faith” which enables an infallibility in believing. This supernatural sense of the faith is “aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth.” A theology of the sensus fidelium must begin by attending to the role of the Holy Spirit in divine revelation. It is central to the belief of Christians that God is fully encountered in Jesus Christ, the Crucified and Risen One; that salvation from God is mediated through him; and that, within that salvific encounter, God is revealed to humanity.

  CHAPTER 3  The Holy Spirit and a Sense for the Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Since faith is the reception of revelation, at the heart of the nature of the church as a community of reception is its nature as a community 
                  of faith. Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit which has two fundamental dimensions: faith as believing, i.e., as a personal response to God’s loving initiative (fides qua creditur), and faith as beliefs and assent to beliefs, i.e., as an affirmative response to the content of what has been revealed (fides quae creditur). As the principle of reception, the Holy Spirit is at work in both these dimensions of faith’s reception of<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Receiving Jesus Christ in the Spirit from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The production of the bipartite Christian Bible is the result of a process of reception and tradition involving the interpretative organon of the 
                  sensus fidei. This organon is at work from the very start of the Jesus tradition till the written expression par excellence of that tradition in the canon of New Testament writings, with its constant theological presupposition—the Jewish Scriptures. With the Gospel written onto their hearts, the believing disciples remembered, retold, and applied their faith in Jesus Christ out of their shared experience of that Gospel. This hermeneutical process involves the understanding, interpretation, and application of Jesus<br>

  Abstract: In addressing, in the previous chapter, the oral and literary formation of the Jesus tradition, the issue of communal authority was raised in terms of “approbative reception.” We now continue our exploration of authority by examining in greater detail the issue of approbative reception within the lives of the communities of the New Testament writings. We will then go on to see how this same concern for approbative reception gives rise to the selection and delimitation of certain writings, and not others, as constituting an accepted norm for the Christian faith.

  Abstract: The mission of the church is to tradition faithfully the reality it has received: God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ, made possible through the Holy Spirit, the principle of that gift’s reception. In the church’s fulfillment of that mission, the rubric of the “three offices of Christ” names three specific, albeit overlapping dimensions of church life. The specific “teaching office” is but one dimension. However, since it is in its treatment of the teaching office that

Determination of the sensus fidei fidelium, and its significance for theology and the magisterium, necessarily demands prior attention to the sensus fidei fidelis, the sense of the faith of the individual believer.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The origins of the 
                  sensus fidelium lie in the origins of the church. The first disciples’ encounters with Jesus begin a process of interpreting his teaching, his actions, and his identity, but there is nevertheless a certain misunderstanding of him during his pre-Easter ministry. However, after his death and resurrection, and with the coming of the Holy Spirit, full Christian faith in him begins. Now, from the new perspective of Easter, and with a sense of being guided in their understanding and interpretation by a special gift from the Holy Spirit, the believing disciples of the Crucified and Risen One<br>

  CHAPTER 1  The Holy Spirit and Revelation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Lumen Gentium 12 teaches that all believers possess “a supernatural sense of the faith” which enables an infallibility in believing. This supernatural sense of the faith is “aroused and sustained by the Spirit of truth.” A theology of the sensus fidelium must begin by attending to the role of the Holy Spirit in divine revelation. It is central to the belief of Christians that God is fully encountered in Jesus Christ, the Crucified and Risen One; that salvation from God is mediated through him; and that, within that salvific encounter, God is revealed to humanity. What is the role of<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Holy Spirit and a Sense for the Faith from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: Since faith is the reception of revelation, at the heart of the nature of the church as a community of reception is its nature as a community 
                  of faith. Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit which has two fundamental dimensions: faith as believing, i.e., as a personal response to God’s loving initiative (fides qua creditur), and faith as beliefs and assent to beliefs, i.e., as an affirmative response to the content of what has been revealed (fides quae creditur). As the principle of reception, the Holy Spirit is at work in both these dimensions of faith’s reception of<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Receiving Jesus Christ in the Spirit from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The production of the bipartite Christian Bible is the result of a process of reception and tradition involving the interpretative organon of the 
                  sensus fidei. This organon is at work from the very start of the Jesus tradition till the written expression par excellence of that tradition in the canon of New Testament writings, with its constant theological presupposition—the Jewish Scriptures. With the Gospel written onto their hearts, the believing disciples remembered, retold, and applied their faith in Jesus Christ out of their shared experience of that Gospel. This hermeneutical process involves the understanding, interpretation, and application of Jesus<br>

  CHAPTER 5  Authority and the Canon of Scripture from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: In addressing, in the previous chapter, the oral and literary formation of the Jesus tradition, the issue of communal authority was raised in terms of “approbative reception.” We now continue our exploration of authority by examining in greater detail the issue of approbative reception within the lives of the communities of the New Testament writings. We will then go on to see how this same concern for approbative reception gives rise to the selection and delimitation of certain writings, and not others, as constituting an accepted norm for the Christian faith. Significantly, we will see that the final canon of<br>

  CHAPTER 7  The Threefold Teaching Office of the Church from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: The mission of the church is to tradition faithfully the reality it has received: God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ, made possible through the Holy Spirit, the principle of that gift’s reception. In the church’s fulfillment of that mission, the rubric of the “three offices of Christ” names three specific, albeit overlapping dimensions of church life. The specific “teaching office” is but one dimension. However, since it is in its treatment of the teaching office that 
                  Lumen Gentium locates discussion of the sensus fidei totius populi, part 3 of this volume, “The Task,” will focus specifically on the task of the<br>

  CHAPTER 8  
                         from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>
  Abstract: In part 3, we are examining the relationship between the 
                  sensus fidelium, theology, and the magisterium in the teaching office of the church. Determination of the sensus fidei fidelium, and its significance for theology and the magisterium, necessarily demands prior attention to the sensus fidei fidelis, the sense of the faith of the individual believer. Such an investigation includes both lay and ordained, bishops and theologians, since they are all individual fideles (“from the bishops to the last of the faithful”).¹ Therefore, before we consider determination of the communal sensus fidelium, this chapter examines the locus, context, mode, norm, and<br>

  Abstract: How to describe the relationship between the Inquisition, “faith’s tribunal,” and Rome’s other courts, central and peripheral? In Rome, as we have seen, the governor’s claims to primacy fostered endless tensions with other agencies. The Inquisition, with its own ambitions and sweeping prerogatives, stirred up the very same kind of troubles. In the state’s assorted districts, justice’s administrative realignment had to resolve simmering conflicts between the pope’s officials, on the one hand, and local courts on the other. These latter were linked, often, to bishops, who by 1600 or so had been bolstered in their powers by the Council of<br>

  Author(s) Brady Veronica<br>
  Abstract: In a way our topic is strangely anachronistic: blasphemy is a problematic notion in a professedly secular society like ours. It is true, of course, that laws against it are still on the books in most states and territories. But they are laws inherited from the English legal system, designed to protect the established religion of the Church of England which was ′part and parcel of the laws of England′ and the monarch, ′the defender of the faith′. In that, these laws against blasphemy served to protect the social fabric rather than any particular theological position. Australia, however, has never<br>

  Author(s) Seyit Kuranda<br>
  Abstract: Islam today, it would seem, has become inflexible and intolerant towards the teachings and ideologies of the West. When in fact, its history shows that it has always been accommodating to other peoples and beliefs, especially Christianity and Judaism. Most people know something of Islam. For instance, that it is one of the three monotheisms or the Abrahamic faiths and that it has much in common with Christianity and Judaism. Yet, there is so much that we do not understand about Islam and its overall world view. Islam is centred on the notion of peace, justice and community, yet when<br>

  Abstract: Debates over Globalisation and The War on Terror often accept that shifting agglomeration called The West as the bastion of secularism. Whether this is a progressive force of freedom and enlightenment or a profane, cold sweatshop machine, this secularism is established against an exotic Other of primal passionate faith or feudal, superstitious zealotry, depending on your position. My talk aims to examine this image of the West and to propose that the arationality associated with the sacred is not a feudal left-over, or even just a tolerated ′personal choice′.

  Abstract: Suspicion of religion and of religious believers is inherent in western atheism and it is not hard to find this reflected in philosophical thought. However, the ′hermeneutics of suspicion′² has been marginal in mainstream philosophy of religion which has concentrated on epistemological issues, inspired by what Merold Westphal has called ′evidential atheism′.³ This critique of religious faith focuses on the alleged epistemological shortfalls in religious beliefs, pointing to its incoherence, unintelligibility and inadequate evidence.<br>

  Abstract: When I tell my colleagues in both the School of Philosophy and the School of Government that I am writing on blasphemy and sacrilege most of them meet me with blank stares and I have a distinct feeling that they think I have crawled out of the seventeenth century. And yet, in this world beset more each day with religious tension between faiths and between adherents of the same faith it becomes increasingly more urgent to find an adequate cross-cultural, multi-faith way of addressing questions of blasphemy and sacrilege.

  Abstract: The idea of an Axial Age has many facets. However, in Karl Jaspers’ thought its decisive feature “is man’s reaching out beyond himself by growing aware of himself within the whole of Being.”¹ “In some way or other man becomes certain of transcendence,” and thereby becomes human in a new and decisive sense: “It is impossible for man to lose transcendence, without ceasing to be man.”² Reference to transcendence is the defining characteristic of Axial man.³ Its correlate in human life is “faith”—not the faith of a particular religious tradition but what Jaspers calls “philosophic faith,”⁴ a faith that<br>

Why did so many historians insist that Partition was inevitable? Were they victims of an inexorable faith in the power of historical explanation?

This suggests that religion is meant to be neither separated or divorced from the world nor collapsed into it, but to serve as a ferment or challenge in the midst of human affairs. The same idea is captured in the well-known phrase that religious or spiritual people are

  Abstract: When I was an associate dean in the School of Theology and Religious Studies at The Catholic University of America, I regularly received calls from prospective students asking, “If I come to study at CUA, can I be assured that I will be getting the true teachings of the magisterium?” What always struck me about this question was the latent concern for certainty in faith, the assumption that theology is all about correct propositions.

  Book Title: Building a Better Bridge-Muslims, Christians, and the Common Good<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ipgrave Michael<br>
  Abstract: Building a Better Bridgeis a record of the fourth "Building Bridges" seminar held in Sarajevo in 2005 as part of an annual symposium on Muslim-Christian relations cosponsored by Georgetown University and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This volume presents the texts of the public lectures with regional presentations on issues of citizenship, religious believing and belonging, and the relationship between government and religion-both from the immediate situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from three contexts further afield: Britain, Malaysia, and West Africa. Both Christian and Muslim scholars propose key questions to be faced in addressing the issue of the common good. How do we approach the civic sphere as believers in particular faiths and as citizens of mixed societies? What makes us who we are, and how do our religious and secular allegiances relate to one another? How do we accommodate our commitment to religious values with acknowledgment of human disagreement, and how can this be expressed in models of governance and justice? How are we, mandated by scriptures to be caretakers, to respond to the current ecological and economic disorder of our world? Michael Ipgrave and his contributors do not claim to provide definitive answers to these questions, but rather they further a necessary dialogue and show that, while Christian and Islamic understandings of God may differ sharply and perhaps irreducibly, the acknowledgment of one another as people of faith is the surest ground on which to build trust, friendship, and cooperation.<br>

The first of these is psychic determinism, which Freud himself regularly presented as a constitutive preconception that could not be questioned. As Sulloway writes: “Freud’s entire life’s work in science was characterized by an abiding faith in the notion that all vital phenomena, including psychical ones, are rigidly and lawfully determined by the principle of cause and effect” (

  Abstract: In recent intellectual discussions, the term
                  post-secularityhas acquired a certain currency or prominence. Like other hyphenated terms (post-modernism, post-metaphysics), the word exudes a certain irenic quality, in the sense that the harsh features of traditional conflicts—between faith and reason, religion and agnosticism—are presumably mitigated if not laid to rest. Unfortunately, this hope may be mistaken. Like many similar labels, the termpost-secularitypapers over disputes of interpretation that cannot be brushed aside. For some interpreters—clinging to the prefixpost—the term signals the end of a loathed or despised aspect of modernity, its lapse into irreligion<br>

  Abstract: Interpretation is sometimes greatly underrated or undervalued; frequently it is seen as a mere method or subordinate tool of research. This view is seriously mistaken—as I shall try to show here mainly with regard to religious faith. As we know, the so-called Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—are based in large measure on divine revelation, that is, on a message reaching human beings from “another shore.” In the case of Islam, the Qur’an is even considered by most pious Muslims as the direct and unmediated “word” of God.

  Abstract: Like all medieval biblical commentaries, Aquinas’s 
                  Commentary on John consists to a significant degree in speculative theological questioning inspired by the biblical text. Proceeding on the assumption that it would not have been possible for St. John to have written what he wrote without the ecclesial light of faith and without engaging speculative questions, Aquinas’s commentary recommends a similar movement in the thought of the biblical interpreter: speculative thinking about divine realities emerges from within biblical exegesis itself. The circular movement from biblical exegesis to speculative theology and back again must be a continual one for the health of both<br>

  FIFTEEN  Anti-Docetism in Aquinas’s from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b22q">Reading John with St. Thomas Aquinas</a><br>
  Author(s) Gondreau Paul<br>
  Abstract: Biblical scholars have long noted the anti-docetic overtones of John’s Gospel. These overtones targeted the latent tendencies in the primitive Christian community to deny, in varying degrees, the reality of Christ’s humanity. (From the Greek δoκέω, “to seem,” docetism, which was the first great challenge to Christological faith, alleges that Christ only 
                  appeared to have come in the flesh.)¹ What is less known, and what remains one of the most unappreciated elements of his thought, is St. Thomas’s own rather pronounced anti-docetism.² Aquinas’s anti-docetism is borne out of his reading of the New Testament, and in particular of the Gospel<br>

  Abstract: Deeply troubled by the Great Depression, two world wars, and modernity’s challenges to religion, Bernard Lonergan attempted to do for our age what Thomas Aquinas did for his—that is, to integrate the best of secular and sacred teaching in order to further the ongoing Catholic tradition of using both faith and reason to promote the common good and to participate in God’s work of redemption. Echoing centuries of the Catholic tradition’s esteem for secular and sacred, or natural and supernatural, forms of learning, Lonergan affirms that “God becomes known to us in two ways: as the ground and end<br>

  Religious Authority and the Challenges of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b68d">Tradition and Modernity</a><br>
  Author(s) JENKINS PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: Societies live by their myths. If asked about the modern history of religious authority, many Americans at least would turn to the legendary 1925 Scopes trial, the bitter confrontation between supporters and critics of Darwinian evolution, as mediated through the film 
                  Inherit the Wind (1960). Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Tariq Ramadan (1962– ) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b68d">Tradition and Modernity</a><br>
  Author(s) Ramadan Tariq<br>
  Abstract: The work of categorization left by scholars through the ages is phenomenal. Specialists in the foundations of law and jurisprudence (
                  usul al-fiqh), who labored at this exercise of extrapolating and categorizing rules on the basis of a reading that was both careful to be faithful to the norm and profoundly rational, have bequeathed to us an unparalleled heritage. A careful reading of these works reveals that very precise modes of grasping the sources were set down very early. Consideration of the language was supported by a double process of distinguishing on the one hand between the unequivocal and the equivocal<br>

  3  Rational Sex at the Margins of the State: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b73f">Troubling Natural Categories</a><br>
  Author(s) BUTT LESLIE<br>
  Abstract: Gaps between global ideals of HIV/AIDS prevention and the reality of local initiatives have been widely noted. Globally sanctioned interventions such as promoting rational decision making around sex, and the ABC model (Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms), draw from behaviour models that regard sexual behaviour as risky when it deviates from narrowly defined norms. Assumptions about reasoned sexual practice are rooted in conceptions of human behaviour that assume individuals can and do routinely assess risks from a narrow rationalistic point of view, and modify their behaviour accordingly. When rational sex is put into practice, cracks show up almost immediately,<br>

  Author(s) GOULDING GILL K.<br>
  Abstract: At the wane of the twentieth and the dawn of the twenty-first century, two successive pontiffs expressed a clear concern for the relationship between truth and religion – or, more specifically, identified the importance of the search for truth and the knowledge of God. The possibility of such a search was seen to involve the use of faith and reason and the fruition of such a search to involve contemplation. The intellectual search for truth illumined by Gospel contemplation and integrating the mystery of faith and reason was a significant focus of attention both for Pope Benedict XVI¹ and his predecessor<br>

  Abstract: Christian faith evokes diverse and sometimes competing images and associations. For some, it conjures up a fairly coherent, albeit complexly interrelated array of experiences, dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. For others, faith names not so much the defining subjective features of religious consciousness as the objective content of Christian religion. Faith is thus construed as a set of doctrines, a peculiar body of teaching and instruction. In short, faith is a divine “deposit” — with the church or the Bible acting as its repository.<br>

  Book Title: Types of Christian Theology-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Placher William C.<br>
  Abstract: In the book Frei proposes classifying theologians according to whether they see Christian theology primarily as an academic discipline or as an internal activity of Christian communities. He describes fie different variations of these views. the first, represented by Immanuel Kant and Gordon represented, regards theology as a philosophical discipline within the academy. The second, represented by theologians as diverse as represented represented, David Tracy, and Carl Henry, correlates specifically Christian with general cultural structures of meaning. The third type, represetned by represented represented and Paul represented, occupies the middle of the spectrum. The fourth type, represetned by Karl Barth, emphasizes the internal descriptive task of theology but remains open to ad hoc correlations with concerns of the wider culture. the fifth, which includes D. Z. Phillips and other Wittgensteinian fideists, opts for pure self-description though this group defends its position with philosophical arguments that, oddly enough connect it with the other end of the spectrum. Frei argues in favor of the third and fourth options. In his view, theologians like Schleiermacher and, even more, Barth, although often seen as polar opposites, enable theology to remain most faithful to the priority of the ecumenically attested literal sense in biblical interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Paul and Scripture-Extending the Conversation<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Stanley Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: This book, which grew out of the Society of Biblical Literature’s Paul and Scripture Seminar, explores some of the methodological problems that have arisen during the last few decades of scholarly research on the apostle Paul’s engagement with his ancestral Scriptures. Essays explore the historical backgrounds of Paul’s interpretive practices, the question of Paul’s “faithfulness" to the context of his biblical references, the presence of Scripture in letters other than the Hauptbriefe, and the role of Scripture in Paul’s theology. All of the essays look at old questions through new lenses in an effort to break through scholarly impasses and advance the debate in new directions. The contributors are Matthew W. Bates, Linda L. Belleville, Roy E. Ciampa, Bruce N. Fisk, Stephen E. Fowl, Leonard Greenspoon, E. Elizabeth Johnson, Mitchell M. Kim, Steve Moyise, Jeremy Punt, Christopher D. Stanley, and Jerry L. Sumney.<br>

  Beyond Hays’s Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzfp">Paul and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Bates Matthew W.<br>
  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzwz">The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, the issue of the canonicity of Qohelet will be examined from a sociological perspective. Specifically, if Qohelet was so heterodox, why was the book allowed to maintain a canonical status or even admitted? This will be answered in several ways. First, it will be shown that Qohelet was not as heterodox as some have maintained. Actually, he represents a return to a more primitive form of the Israelite religion and faith. He utilizes minor elements of traditional wisdom to construct his theological position, which means that he simply reconfigures traditional wisdom. Second, it will be demonstrated that<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32c046">The Future of the Biblical Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Andiñach Pablo R.<br>
  Abstract: A combination of social changes, the political climate, and various incipient new winds in the life of the Christian churches supplied the fertile ground in which a new mode of reading the Scriptures began to germinate. Around 1970, the need for other tools with which to understand the Christian mission became evident in Latin America, and what would later come to be called the Theology of Liberation was born, a different way of approaching theological reflection. Alongside this theology, as faithful companion, an alternative way of interpreting the Bible came to be, as well. This is what Juan Luis Segundo<br>

  The “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim Relations: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Cohen Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century there was nearly universal consensus that Jews in the Islamic Middle Ages—taking al-Andalus, or Muslim Spain, as the model—lived in a “Golden Age” of Jewish-Muslim harmony,¹ an interfaith utopia of tolerance and
                  convivencia.² It was thought that Jews mingled freely and comfortably with Muslims, immersed in Arabic-Islamic culture, including the language, poetry, philosophy, science, medicine, and the study of Scripture—a society, furthermore, in which Jews could and many did ascend to the pinnacles of political power in Muslim government. This idealized picture went beyond Spain to encompass the entire Muslim world, from Baghdad<br>

  Muslim-Jewish Relations in Israel from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Ben-Rafael Eliezer<br>
  Abstract: The Israeli Declaration of Independence promised that the State of Israel ensures complete social and political equality for its citizens, irrespective of religion, race, or sex, and guarantees freedom of religion. There is no declared official religion, and each religious community has jurisdiction over its internal affairs and matters of personal status.¹ All religious courts are recognized, autonomous, and supported by government budgets; accordingly, Israel funds more than one hundred mosques and their imams. The government also finances numerous extracurricular Islamic studies. Nevertheless, Israel’s definition as a Jewish state implies a privileged link to the faith attached to Jewishness, and<br>

  Shabbat and Friday in Judaism and Islam from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Hawary Mohamed<br>
  Abstract: Both Islam and Judaism established a time of weekly rest for their faithful: for the Muslims, it is Friday; for the Jews, Shabbat, which also includes part of Friday, beginning after sunset and lasting until the next day when the stars come out. That proximity of the periods of rest is undoubtedly part of a more general kinship between the two religions and, to a lesser extent, between them and the other form of monotheism, Christianity, which chose Sunday as its day of rest. Beyond the similarities in their weekly calendars, however, these two religions of the Law have different<br>

  Jewish and Muslim Charity in the Middle Ages: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Lev Yaacov<br>
  Abstract: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam consider the three “theological virtues” of faith, hope, and charity to be the foundational stones of their value systems. Contrary to what some may think, charity is as essential to Jewish and Islamic life as it is to the Christian worldview. Between pure generosity and social redistribution, it deeply structures traditional societies by defining the respective roles of the rich and the poor, the use of money, and the legitimacy of the institutions that have taken up the task to collect and redistribute it.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>

  Abstract: Both Shiʿism and Judaism are diverse faiths, and it is always tricky, not to say problematic, to speak of their relationship as if they were monolithic entities. Orientalists and specialists in both Islamic studies and Judaic studies differ greatly in their assessment of the Shiʿites’ position in relation to the Jews during the classical period of Islam. To cite only two major scholars, Ignaz Goldziher in
                  Vorlesungen über den Islam(1910), and Shlomo D. Goitein in Jews and Arabs (1955), both believe that the attitude of Shiʿism, unlike that of Sunnism, is strongly imbued with fanaticism and intolerance, which makes<br>

  Embodied Letter: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt3fgz64">A History of Jewish-Muslim Relations</a><br>
  Author(s) Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: The complex and variegated, and at times conflictual and contentious, relationship of the three Abrahamic faiths, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, can be profitably understood by the Heideggerian notion of
                  Zusammengehören, a term that denotes the belonging-together or the drawing-near of what persists in the difference of being the same.¹ To grasp the subtlety of this point, we must attend to Heidegger’s somewhat counterintuitive distinction between “the identical” (das Gleiche) and “the same” (das Selbe). In “Die Onto-Theo-Logische Verfassung der Metaphysik” (a lecture delivered on February 24, 1957, in Todtnauberg as part of a seminar on Hegel’sWissenschaft der Logik), he<br>

  Abstract: Islam occupies a unique position in the medieval Jewish imagination. From the tenth through the thirteenth centuries, Islamic society was for many Jews the bastion of civilization and culture, in which Jews played a vital and transformative role.¹ Yet as members of a proud religious minority, many Jews regarded the religion of Islam with deep ambivalence. Jews at once repudiated Islam as a legitimate faith while singling it out from all others as an exponent of pure monotheism on par with its Jewish precursor. As such, Islam occupied a middle position in Jewish law, outside the divine covenant yet the<br>

  Abstract: Many architects of the Jewish faith, whether from families long settled on the banks of the Nile or part of the waves of immigrants who contributed to the formation of modern Egypt, have distinguished themselves in the field of architecture and in the protection of the heritage of Cairo and Alexandria. One of the most engaging figures was the Hungarian Max Herz (1856–1919), who, as chief architect on the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art, oversaw the fate of the historic monuments of Cairo for more than a quarter of a century.

  Book Title: When Our Words Return-Writing, Hearing, and Remembering Oral Traditions from Alasak and the Yukon<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schneider William<br>
  Abstract: The title to this interdisciplinary collection draws on the Yupik Eskimo belief that seals, fish, and other game are precious gifts that, when treated with respect and care, will return to be hunted again. Just so, if oral traditions are told faithfully and respectfully, they will return to benefit future generations. The contributors to this volume are concerned with the interpretation and representation of oral narrative and how it is shaped by its audience and the time, place, and cultural context of the narration. Thus, oral traditions are understood as a series of dialogues between tradition bearers and their listeners, including those who record, write, and interpret.<br>

  Abstract: In this engaging article, William Wilson provides an overview of the social and artistic movement of late nineteenth-century Finland known as Karelianism. The term Karelia (Finnish Karjala) designates both a portion of eastern Finland and abroad expanse of territory east of the border. The eastern region was never part of the Swedish empire, an entity that molded the culture of Finland proper for six centuries. Predominantly Orthodox in faith and possessing a language distinct from (although very closely related to) Finnish, it would seem an unlikely candidate for national epitome.

  Book Title: Theorizing Scriptures-New Critical Orientations to a Cultural Phenomenon<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): WIMBUSH VINCENT L.<br>
  Abstract: Historically, religious scriptures are defined as holy texts that are considered to be beyond the abilities of the layperson to interpret. Their content is most frequently analyzed by clerics who do not question the underlying political or social implications of the text, but use the writing to convey messages to their congregations about how to live a holy existence. In Western society, moreover, what counts as scripture is generally confined to the Judeo-Christian Bible, leaving the voices of minorities, as well as the holy texts of faiths from Africa and Asia, for example, unheard. In this innovative collection of essays that aims to turn the traditional bible-study definition of scriptures on its head, Vincent L. Wimbush leads an in-depth look at the social, cultural, and racial meanings invested in these texts. Contributors hail from a wide array of academic fields and geographic locations and include such noted academics as Susan Harding, Elisabeth Shnssler Fiorenza, and William L. Andrews. Purposefully transgressing disciplinary boundaries, this ambitious book opens the door to different interpretations and critical orientations, and in doing so, allows an ultimately humanist definition of scriptures to emerge.<br>

  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

A careful review of the mythological, historical, and biblical lives of “Jezebel” unearths the value of reappropriating Jezebel as a model for radical uses of the erotic.

Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  Author(s) Edelman Samuel M.<br>
  Abstract: This essay is written with Zev Garber in the forefront of my mind. He has always been a whirlwind of energy and activity. For the amount of teaching he does, his level of scholarly productivity is mind-boggling. Not only that, but Zev has been the mentor of many younger scholars. He inspires, he encourages, and he finds ways to get their work published. In short, Zev is an inspiration for scholarly achievement and passion. In the area of interfaith dialogue, Zev has been a pioneer with the Scholars Conference on the Holocaust and the Churches Post-Shoah Midrash Reading Group. In<br>

  Author(s) Schweitzer Frederick M.<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his life Benjamin Disraeli (1804–81) was scorned as a Jew: “the Jew scamp,” “that damned bumptious Jew boy,” “the wandering Jew, with the brand of Cane [
                  sic] upon him,” and was subjected to bigoted attacks such as Sidney Herbert’s provoking a roar of laughter in the House of Commons by questioning Disraeli in solemn mockery, how anyone could adopt “a faith the profession of which must begin with a surgical operation!”¹ Disraeli often lamented, “Ah, it is not my Government they [the people of England] dislike: I tell you it is me they dislike,” that he had been<br>

  Book Title: The Jewish Jesus-Revelation, Reflection, Reclamation<br>
  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: There is a general understanding within religious and academic circles that the incarnate Christ of Christian belief lived and died a faithful Jew. This volume addresses Jesus in the context of Judaism. By emphasizing his Jewishness, the authors challenge today’s Jews to reclaim the Nazarene as a proto-rebel rabbi and invite Christians to discover or rediscover the Church’s Jewish heritage. The essays in this volume cover historical, literary, liturgical, philosophical, religious, theological, and contemporary issues related to the Jewish Jesus. Several of them were originally presented at a three-day symposium on “Jesus in the Context of Judaism and the Challenge to the Church,” hosted by the Samuel Rosenthal Center for Judaic Studies at Case Western Reserve University in 2009. In the context of pluralism, in the temper of growing interreligious dialogue, and in the spirit of reconciliation, encountering Jesus as living history for Christians and Jews is both necessary and proper. This book will be of particular interest to scholars of the New Testament and Early Church who are seeking new ways of understanding Jesus in his religious and cultural milieu, as well Jewish and Christian theologians and thinkers who are concerned with contemporary Jewish and Christian relationships.<br>

  Author(s) Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: Though many articles, reviews, and books are not of one opinion on the life and time of Jesus, there is a general understanding in the dogma of the church and in the quests of the academy that the incarnate Christ of Christian belief lived and died a faithful Jew,¹ and what this says to contemporary Jews and Christians is the focus of this volume depicting Jesus in the context of Judaism and its impact on Jewish and Christian traditional and contemporary views of the other.<br>

  Author(s) Smerick Christina M.<br>
  Abstract: The Judaism of Jesus of Nazareth provides a challenge to most American Christians of any denominational stripe, as typically this Judaism is not emphasized in religious education or in religious services or sermons. While I currently teach at an evangelical Christian college in the United States, I was raised in the Roman Catholic tradition and can state unequivocally that I did not receive a robust education with regard to Jesus’ Jewish faith in my CCD¹ or catechism courses as a child.

  Abstract: Although considering the historical Jesus a Jew is a common, but not universal academic tenet, it is not so perceived by those albeit rather limited segments of the lay public whose anti-Judaism causes them to separate Jesus

  Author(s) Ansai Yamazaki<br>
  Abstract: Yamazaki Ansai was both the most faithful and virtually unquestioning exponent of Zhu Xi’s neo-Confucian philosophy in Tokugawa Japan as well as a later pioneer of a syncretistic religious-philosophical system affirming the fundamental unity of neo-Confucianism and Shinto. Compared to the perfection of Zhu Xi’s work, other forms of neo-Confucianism seemed to him incomplete, shallow, or distorted. These criticisms, reiterated by his disciples, carried over to thinkers like Hayashi Razan* who drew on authors critical of Zhu Xi.<br>

  Abstract: Because of the important place it is recognized to have in the intellectual history of Japan, the Kyoto School has been extracted from the rest of twentieth-century philosophy for special treatment. Nishida Kitarō* and the circle of thinkers he inspired at the University of Kyoto are often considered Japan’s first original philosophers in the modern sense of the term, and have become known as a bridge between East and West. While their originality and their faithfulness to disparate traditions remain matters of dispute, their impact on philosophical discussions within Japan and outside the country is unquestioned.

  Abstract: What is “dark writing”? In the first three chapters it referred to the trace of movement that is arrested in spatial representations. A history of journeys, encounters, inclinations, and leaps of faith can be shown to survive in maps and plans once their symbolic character is recognized, and it is these supplementary inscriptions that constitute dark writing. Dark writing alludes to the bodies that go missing in the action of representation. But it does not seek to replace them—to represent them. Aligned to their passage, it registers their passage graphically, as a pattern of traces. In the last three<br>

  Abstract: Protestant Christianity has often been guilty of cultural imperialism. Guided by the idea of the “white man’s burden” to “civilize” the world, Victorian-era missionaries regarded with contempt the cultures and religions of non-Western peoples and imposed upon them not only a new faith, but also a new way of life. Korea was no exception. When the first Protestant missionaries arrived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, they condemned ancestor veneration as “idol worship” and instructed converts to burn traditional ritual objects. They also carried out a whole range of social reforms, from temperance to hygiene. The missionaries saw<br>

  Abstract: Clifford Geertz, one of the most influential thinkers of our time, here discusses some of the most urgent issues facing intellectuals today. In this collection of personal and revealing essays, he explores the nature of his anthropological work in relation to a broader public, serving as the foremost spokesperson of his generation of scholars, those who came of age after World War II. His reflections are written in a style that both entertains and disconcerts, as they engage us in topics ranging from moral relativism to the relationship between cultural and psychological differences, from the diversity and tension among activist faiths to "ethnic conflict" in today's politics.<br>

  Book Title: Modernity's Wager-Authority, the Self, and Transcendence<br>

  Abstract: Adam Seligman, one of our most important social thinkers, continues the incisive critique of modernity he began in his previously acclaimed
         The Idea of Civil SocietyandThe Problem of Trust.In this provocative new work of social philosophy, Seligman evaluates modernity's wager, namely, the gambit to liberate the modern individual from external social and religious norms by supplanting them with the rational self as its own moral authority. Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

  Book Title: Christian Political Ethics-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Coleman John A.<br>
  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

  Abstract: Some of the more interesting things that Christianity has to say about territorial boundaries come by way of its views on the nation, national identity and loyalty, and nationalism. Historically, of course, Christianity—or, rather, Christians—have said different and sometimes quite contradictory things on these topics. Some have considered each nation to be specially ordained by the eternal God, while others have stressed the mutable historicality of national compositions and boundaries.¹ Some have virtually equated loyalty to the nation with loyalty to God, while others have regarded it as inimical to pacific, universalist Christian faith.

To this effect, the only version of the Bible that was to be recognized was the

  Abstract: These words, a journal entry of 1844, could be inscribed as the motto above everything Kierkegaard wrote. Not that he did not yearn and seek after unity, and find it in the experience of Christian faith/love. But his fundamental conviction was that any unity, however arrived at, which erased, “annulled,” or even blurred “life's doubleness” would lead to the loss of freedom and to the absorption and destruction of the human individual, of human “existence.” This duality is at the base<br>

  Abstract: Of all those who transmitted the Free French message of defiance, resistance, and hope to those living in Vichy France or in the German-occupied zone, none was more eloquent than the journalist-turned-broadcaster Maurice Schumann. Schumann was born in Paris on 10 April 1911 to upper-middle-class Jewish parents who were so thoroughly assimilated that they felt only the most nominal link to their ancestral faith.¹ Schumann

  Abstract: Born in Montpellier on 3 February 1912 to a working-class Catholic father and a Protestant mother, Jacques Soustelle was baptized in the Reformed communion. Although as an adult he drifted away from his childhood faith, Soustelle always saw himself as shaped by the Huguenot tradition. He never forgot early memories of itinerant lay preachers who travelled door-to-door throughout the Protestant heartland in the Cévennes distributing tracts with their message of eternal salvation. In writing about his wartime commitment to Free France, Soustelle recalls taking heart from these sometimes solitary pilgrims:<br>

  Abstract: Of all those drawn to the Gaullist cause, Simone Weil must surely be counted the most spiritually exalted.¹ Born in Paris in 1909 to a determinedly agnostic Alsatian-Jewish father and a mother whose family was only nominally linked to Judaism, Simone developed an early antipathy to the faith of her ancestors and an equally powerful fascination for the Catholic version of Christianity. This spiritual outlook was based partly on an aversion to the Old Testament which she saw to be ethnocentric in focus² and partly on a fascination for Catholic ritual.

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Reading is one of the basic skills a student needs. But reading is not just an activity of the eyes and the brain. Reading Theologically, edited by Eric D. Barreto, brings together eight seminary educators from a variety of backgrounds to explore what it means to be a reader in a seminary context--to read theologically. Reading theologically involves a specific minset adn posture towards texts and ideas, people and communities alike. Reading theologically is not just about academic skill building but about the formation of a ministerial leader who can engage scholarship critically, interpret Scripture and tradition faithfully, welcome different perspectives, and help lead others to do the same. This brief, readable, edited volume emphasizes the vital skills, habits, practices, and values involved in reading theologically. Reading Theologically is a vital resource for students beginning the seminary process and professors of introductory level seminary courses.<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

The average law teacher’s jurisprudence combined interest balancing, fundamental rights analysis, and institutional coordination between courts, agencies, and the legislature.¹ Legal studies at many law schools were regarded as an autonomous discipline because legal reasoning and legal methods were thought to be sufficiently distinct from the methods of other academic disciplines in the general university. The autonomy of legal thought was relatively secure as the 1970s began, but then events, both internal and external to law, caused legal thinkers to question their faith<br>

She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies.

  Book Title: Religious Imaginaries-The Liturgical and Poetic Practices of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): DIELEMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: Religious Imaginariesexplores liturgical practice as formative for how three Victorian women poets imagined the world and their place in it and, consequently, for how they developed their creative and critical religious poetics. In doing so, this new study rethinks several assumptions in the field: that Victorian women's faith commitments tend to limit creativity; that the contours of church experiences matter little for understanding religious poetry; and that gender is more significant than liturgy in shaping women's religious poetry.Exploring the import of bodily experience for spiritual, emotional, and cognitive forms of knowing, Karen Dieleman explains and clarifies the deep orientations of different strands of nineteenth-century Christianity, such as Congregationalism's high regard for verbal proclamation, Anglicanism and Anglo-Catholicism's valuation of manifestation, and revivalist Roman Catholicism's recuperation of an affective aesthetic. Looking specifically at Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter as astute participants in their chosen strands of Christianity, Dieleman reveals the subtle textures of these women's religious poetry: the different voices, genres, and aesthetics they create in response to their worship experiences. Part recuperation, part reinterpretation, Dieleman's readings highlight each poet's innovative religious poetics.Dieleman devotes two chapters to each of the three poets: the first chapter in each pair delineates the poet's denominational practices and commitments; the second reads the corresponding poetry.Religious Imaginarieshas appeal for scholars of Victorian literary criticism and scholars of Victorian religion, supporting its theoretical paradigm by digging deeply into primary sources associated with the actual churches in which the poets worshipped, detailing not only the liturgical practices but also the architectural environments that influenced the worshipper's formation. By going far beyond descriptions of various doctrinal positions, this research significantly deepens our critical understanding of Victorian Christianity and the culture it influenced.<br>

  Abstract: To turn from nineteenth-century Congregationalism to Anglicanism, and especially Anglo-Catholicism, is in many ways to turn from what David Tracy, working from Paul Ricoeur, calls proclamation to what he calls manifestation, or from a dialectical toward an analogical imagination and language.¹ Congregationalism, we have seen, grounds the Christ-event as a Word-event, thus calling Christians to witness to that central experience in further, often dialectical, word and action. Anglicanism historically also values proclamation, with Scripture and sermon integral to its liturgy; as Tracy points out, the Christian faith has historically held that “Jesus Christ is both the decisive word and the<br>

Although the plot is marginally predicated on an anecdote familiar to Synge about “a man from Connaught who killed his father with the blow of a spade” and then sought refuge on the Western islands (Aran, Collected2: 95), the drama’s development distinguishes itself more by its departures from this local account than by its faithfulness<br>

  Author(s) LUBIN DAVID M.<br>
  Abstract: Monsters, madmen, and ghouls have always stalked the American imagination. Between the Revolution and the Civil War, headless horsemen, murdering apes, killer sharks, giant white whales, pillaging barbarians, and other evil avatars inhabited the fiction of Washington Irving, Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville as well as the art of John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, and Thomas Cole. After the Civil War, the presence of such grotesque and aberrant figures diminished. Beholden to evolutionary science, naturalism had little use for the supernatural.

  Author(s) GALLAGHER LOWELL<br>
  Abstract: This book presents an itinerary of English Catholicism in the early modern period. Imagine you are looking at an interactive map depicting the fortunes of members of the ‘old faith’ – variously called ‘Romanist,’ ‘Romish,’ and ‘papist,’ as well as ‘Catholic’ – in Reformation-era England. Maps tell stories of one kind or another and this one would be in no way different, but the embedded graphs and visual icons would yield a tangle of information not easily reducible to a single story. The machinery of an epic tale would be on display, notably through the sense of heroic antagonism animating the sequence<br>

  Author(s) Stone Alison<br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century philosophy can be broadly characterised by several themes: the conflict between metaphysics and religious faith on the one hand and the empirical sciences on the other; a new focus on history, progress and evolution; new ideas of individuality, society and revolution; and ever-increasing concerns about nihilism.¹ This volume provides a re-examination of nineteenth-century philosophy in terms of these and other themes distinctive of the period.<br>

  Author(s) di Giovanni George<br>
  Abstract: In 1935 Paul Hazard famously spoke of a ‘crisis of the European mind’ to describe the transition from the earlier confessional era – when reason was still taken to be subservient to faith and political power to the rule of God and the Church – to the Enlightenment, when reason reversed that relation by asserting its autonomy with respect to religious belief and philosophers began to look to reason’s rule for the authentication of political power. Hazard himself dated that transition to around 1680 (Hazard [1935] 1953: xv–xvi). Recent scholarship has pushed this date back to 1650 and has also<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, the contributors have brought their expertise to bear on many democratic moments, both expected and unexpected, down through history. Together, these chapters tell quite a story of common people taking their chances to create ideas, opportunities and institutions of government where their collective voices have a role to play and often carry the day. But as more people identify themselves as democrats, as more countries embrace democracy, as there is more opportunity for participation at local, national and international levels, there is also evidence of a lapse of faith, a moment of uncertainty, a loss of<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I follow the path of a dislocation. When Levinas reads Derrida, he renounces the ‘ridiculous ambition of “improving”’ (
                     NP89) a true philosopher. Levinas is content to cross Derrida’s path in order to engage him in a philosophical encounter. I shall report this encounter by following the reading that Levinas gives of Derrida, a reading which, while continually transgressing the order of commentary, remains faithful, I believe, to the ultimate ethical orientation of the thinking under discussion. At stake here is the perverse fidelity of a dislocation in the act of reading.<br>

  Author(s) Huang Alexander C. Y.<br>
  Abstract: Literary translation is a love affair. Depending on the context, it could be love at first sight or hot pursuit of a lover’s elusive nodding approval. In other instances it could be unrequited love, and still others a test of devotion and faith; or else an eclectic combination of any of these events. Translation involves artistic creativity, not a workshop of equivalences. As human civilizations developed and intersected, translation emerged as a necessary form of communication and a way of life. It highlighted and put to productive use the space between cultures, between individuals with different perspectives and within one’s<br>

It is good, certainly, when friends are loyal, lovers faithful, their tears authentic, vows earnest, stories trustworthy. It is generally in our interest to know what’s up and what really happened. Not always, of course, or only: fiction and flattery, artifice and illusion, duplicity and pipe-dreams are also important, sometimes necessary, perhaps even, in their various ways, truthful, indeed sometimes supremely so – or so the poets have told us, though it’s not clear they’re to be trusted<br>

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen in Chapter 4, the work of both Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein shows a tension between realism as faithfulness to the truth of the world on one hand and realism as reproducing the myths of bourgeois capitalism on the other. For Vertov, facts were central in overcoming this problematic of representation, as expressed in his rejection of actors, filmscripts, created scenarios, and so on. For Eisenstein, however, the relation between the facts of world and their reproduction on the screen was in some ways more complex. He criticised Vertov and kino-eye in general for misunderstanding this<br>

  Book Title: The Real and the Sacred-Picturing Jesus in Nineteenth-Century Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): GATRALL JEFFERSON J. A.<br>
  Abstract: The figure of Jesus appears as a character in dozens of nineteenth-century novels, including works by Balzac, Flaubert, Dickens, Dostoevsky, and others.
         The Real and the Sacredfocuses in particular on two fiction genres: the Jesus redivivus tale and the Jesus novel. In the former, Christ makes surprise visits to earth, from rural Flanders (Balzac) and Muscovy (Turgenev) to the bustling streets of Paris (Flaubert), Seville (Dostoevsky), Berlin, and Boston. In the latter, the historical Jesus wanders through the picturesque towns and plains of first-century Galilee and Judea, attracting followers and enemies. In short, authors subjected Christ, the second person of the Christian trinity, to the realist norms of secular fiction. Thus the Jesus of nineteenth-century fiction was both situated within a specific time and place, whether ancient or modern, and positioned before the gaze of increasingly daring literary portraitists. The highest artistic challenge for authors was to paint, using mere words, a faithful picture of Jesus in all his humanity. The incongruity of a sacred figure inhabiting secular literary forms nevertheless tested the limits of modern realist style no less than the doctrine of Christ's divinity.<br>

Demonstrating God’s grace became of paramount importance to the justification of each New World mission. Radical Protestant sects such as Independents, Congregationalists, and Baptists developed the test of faith, an oral and public testimony designed to mitigate the uncertainty surrounding signs of election. Before a group of discerning witnesses, testifiers declared adequate (albeit uncertain) proof of their own election while also providing data in response to a metaphysical problem, namely, the uncertainty<br>

As communicative devices, history and heritage rely on antithetical modes of persuasion. Heritage does not pretend to present a genuinely authentic, and reasonably plausible, account of some past but is a declaration of faith in that which came before.¹ While some observers celebrate heritage as a complementary or alternative way of mediating the past to popular audiences, critics dismiss it as little more than counterfeit history, packaged for commercial consumption.² “While it looks old, heritage is actually<br>

A lack of faith in the old has made it easier for the new to break through. And yet because identity formation has been foremost among the common concerns of social theory for years and years, it is hardly coincidental that “the new” happened to take the study of identity formation as one of its<br>

  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas understands his thinking as postmetaphysical (see his eponymous book).

  9  Religion Within the Limits of Reasonableness from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/ferr14072">The Force of the Example</a><br>
  Abstract: As the title suggests, something has changed in the relation between religion and politics as the twentieth century passed into the next. What precisely has changed is the subject discussed in this chapter. Is the demand emerging within Western democratic societies for a more conspicuous and visible “public role” to be played by religious faith, or at least for deprivatization of religious affiliation and conduct, justified and legitimate? What are the implications of acknowledging this transformation of our public space for our understanding of the nexus of religion, modern society, and politics?<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary conversations about religion and culture are framed by two reductive definitions of secularity. In one, multiple faiths and nonfaiths coexist free from a dominant belief in God. In the other, we deny the sacred altogether and exclude religion from rational thought and behavior. But is there a third way for those who wish to rediscover the sacred in a skeptical society? What kind of faith, if any, can be proclaimed after the ravages of the Holocaust and the many religion-based terrors since?<br>

  Book Title: The Highway of Despair-Critical Theory After Hegel<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith. Embracing the extremism of what Marx, in the spirit of Hegel, called the "ruthless critique of everything existing," she affirms the contemporary purchase of radical critical theory, resulting in a passionate approach to political thought.<br>

  2  Kierkegaard’s Diagnostics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/mara16866">The Highway of Despair</a><br>
  Abstract: The writings of Søren Kierkegaard present a notorious challenge to the reader in search of definitive answers to the questions they pose about despair, anxiety, and other “wounds of Spirit.” While Kierkegaard—under his own name or with his many pseudonyms—hoped to elucidate a Christian remedy to the seemingly intractable problem of modern despair, his reformulation of faith seems somewhat feeble in the face of it. Kierkegaard’s texts simply cannot be measured by the solutions he offers, which are consistently inadequate to the questions he raises. Some of his readers have looked to the upbuilding discourses (the “religious” writings<br>

  Concluding Postscript from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/mara16866">The Highway of Despair</a><br>
  Abstract: No single thinker has done more to shape the idea of critical theory in the postwar period than Jürgen Habermas. As I see things, Habermas turns away from a potential project opened up by the thinkers considered in this study—not just Adorno, to whom his connection is obvious, but also Bataille, of whom he is substantially more critical, and Fanon, about whom he says nothing. In recent years, Habermas has turned his attention to questions pertaining to philosophy and religion, the relationship between reason and faith, and the connection between postmetaphysical thinking and theological endeavors. These inquiries are exciting,<br>

  Abstract: While the antinomian movements in England were central to our understanding of Blake, one may ask how influential they were for Blavatsky, who was born and raised in Russia in the Orthodox Church. The late nineteenth century did not make it easy to be an antirationalist as Blake was. It was not only the impact of science that began to erode the field of visionary religion but also a galaxy of philosophers and thinkers who questioned the intellectual legitimacy of the Christian faith.

                  Writing in the Dust. Williams had experienced the destruction and the dust firsthand, having been near the World Trade Center when the planes hit. He begins his reflections by invoking the “last words” of farewell from those on Flight 93, sent by cell phones to their loved ones. For Williams, these “nonreligious words are testimony to what religious language is supposed to be about—the triumph of pointless, gratuitous love, the affirming of faithfulness even when<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: Among the numerous “conflicts” that characterize contemporary philosophical and intellectual discourse, the one between laicism¹ and religion—between the need for democratic states to promote confessional pluralism and substantial relativism, and the supposedly peremptory, authoritarian, and hegemonic culture of the religions—is emerging as one of the most crucial and important. The debate on the laicity of the state in France or in Turkey, the theologization of politics in the United States, the discussion of so-called postsecular society in Germany, the ongoing debate in Italy about the relation between relativism and faith, and the polemical fury over the clash of<br>

  Abstract: Pierpaolo antonello: One of the major topics of debate in recent years in Italy has been the disconnect between faith and relativism or, to put it another way, between universalism, whether anthropological or moral, on the one hand, and multicultural relativism, on the other. Obviously, you both start from essentially different positions in philosophical terms, but I would like to probe a bit to see what kind of reconciliation (if any) might be possible between these two positions.<br>

I had pushed the students a little, asking where we might find proof that scholarly “cultural work” had led to political change. I had asked the question because in one way or another, having an allout faith in representations, students would make mind-blowingly smart and sophisticated rhetorical moves to argue either the text’s assertion of a transformative politics of resistance or its normalizing<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Faith: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/754720">Wicked Cinema</a><br>
  Abstract: Many films disparage or call into question the rationality of faith and with that, the character of the believer. This chapter begins to explore the disjuncture between cinematic representations and the religious beliefs of more than four billion followers of the Abrahamic religions. These onscreen depictions of faith, or the lack thereof, reveal much about the ideological divide fueling the culture wars.<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  Transgressing Divinity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7560/754720">Wicked Cinema</a><br>
  Abstract: With each chapter, my examination of the cinematic depiction of religion has moved up a rung on a hierarchical ladder, from the base of faith to the believer, the minister, and now the Divine. In this chapter, I offer a queer reading on films that reverse the spirit/flesh dichotomy in a subtle or blatant undermining of the Divine.¹ These representations contribute to the othering of religion, as the believer’s faith appears to lie in an undeserving God and a hellish heaven.<br>

  Abstract: The preceding chapters of
                     wicked cinemaexamine films produced in the 1980s and 90s that make believers a dangerous Other through the depiction of their religious experiences, their practices, and the God they worship. This othering—whether it is through feminization, structured absence, or abjection—is similar to how cinema othered gays and lesbians in the past. This concluding chapter examines how this religious Other is represented as persecuted by his/her faith and the potential fallout of this negative portrayal.<br>

  Author(s) PROCTOR ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: The 1960s witnessed the most significant changes in the history of the Roman Catholic Church (and, arguably, in Christianity) since at least the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. A major liturgical reform was announced at the Second Vatican Council of 1962 to 1965 and was subsequently implemented throughout the Church. This reform marked an endorsement of previous calls for change from theologians, liturgy scholars, and ordinary priests around the world; known as the Liturgical Movement, it now has a well-documented historical narrative.¹ Yet in Britain these changes came suddenly to many clergy and faithful, since few had any significant awareness of the<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable book that is at once learned, startlingly original, and highly personal, Ann W. Astell explores the ambiguity of the phrase "eating beauty." The phrase evokes the destruction of beauty, the devouring mouth of the grave, the mouth of hell. To eat beauty is to destroy it. Yet in the case of the Eucharist the person of faith who eats the Host is transformed into beauty itself, literally incorporated into Christ. In this sense, Astell explains, the Eucharist was "productive of an entire 'way' of life, a virtuous life-form, an artwork, with Christ himself as the principal artist." The Eucharist established for the people of the Middle Ages distinctive schools of sanctity-Cistercian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Ignatian-whose members were united by the eucharistic sacrament that they received.<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the sixteenth century, Martin Luther found new meaning in the Pauline expression 
                  justification by faith through the hermeneutic concept sola scriptura. Luther’s theological discovery inspired others to articulate and invoke fundamental religious, political, and cultural changes within the European societies. At the same time, the Protestant Reformation gave rise to a tension between a religious and a humanistic outlook. Many solutions put forward to overcome this tension were informed by fear or fascination and appear to us as reactionary or progressive. Such figures as Paracelsus, Erasmus, Trithemius occupied a place between the strict confines of religion<br>

  Abstract: Identity is a catch-all term of our times. It is an empty vessel which can be filled with almost any content. As a quick perusal of recent volumes on European communities shows, astute anthropologists can use identity as a general framing device for a surprising variety of ethnographic data. In these books discussion can span from the individual to the regional to the supranational, from styles of dress or dance to religious faith. The range of possible topics seems to be limited only by the imaginative power of the compiler. The worry, of course, is that we anthropologists may well<br>

  Abstract: Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born in the village of Röcken, Saxony, on 15 October 1844. His father and both grandfathers were Protestant clergymen, so the family naturally expected him to follow in this tradition when, after attending primary school in Naumburg, in 1858 he took up a place at the prestigious boarding school of Schulpforta nearby. Here, he excelled at the classics, which he went on to study at the universities of Bonn (1864) and Leipzig (1865–69), by which stage he had abandoned his religious faith. As a student he fell under the influence of the philosophy of Arthur<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Sheridan<br>
  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Author(s) Connelly John<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I wish to propose an unusual, almost revolutionary approach to studying Catholic-Jewish relations in Poland: namely to treat the Polish Catholic Church as a theological institution, that is, a place producing ideas about religion, in particular, ideas about Jews. A central theme in these relations is of course hostility, yet it has been notoriously difficult to specify the relation between religiously based hostility and modern anti-semitism, the sort that led to the Holocaust. The Holocaust’s planners after all considered themselves anti-Christian. They regarded Christianity as a Jewish faith and they tried to weaken the Catholic Church as<br>

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mylonas Christos<br>
  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  Chapter Seven  THE BALKAN ORTHODOX COMMONWEALTH “I BELIEVE IN ONE GOD… THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND EARTH, OF ALL VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE ENTITIES… AND IN ONE HOLY, APOSTOLIC AND CATHOLIC CHURCH.” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1cgf87j">Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals</a><br>
  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as already suggested, through the dialectical interaction of her religious content—doctrinal and functional—with the national substance of the Serbian being, sacralises the identity of the latter in the confines of the human–divine communion. Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor.

The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

First, negative theology is never entirely negative, and while Franke recognizes that poetic language is both deconstructive and open, he nevertheless insists that our various theologies—literary or religious—finally have no positive content. Perhaps this is the postmodernism in his negative theology because this is not entirely consistent with the theological tradition. A good counterexample is Pseudo‐Dionysius, whose mystical theology seeks finally to overcome the limitations of both positive and negative speaking. Dionysius insists that God is love in a way that is both negative and positive. On this, Franke should consider the work of Jean‐Luc Marion and especially his response to Jacques Derrida on the subject of negative theology, and this omission is a considerable oversight. Second, many people of various faiths will never accept that their understanding of the transcendent has no positive content, and if this is a precondition for dialogue, then it is unlikely to occur. On this, the practical dimension of Franke’s study needs more development, as well as more traditional examples of poetic and theological openness from contemporary religious life.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Both
      Faith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsilluminate and challenge the assumptions in Voegelin's philosophy and lead readers in new directions for Voegelinian scholarship. They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The
         Left Behindnovels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins have become a major publishing phenomenon in recent years. The novels have succeeded in part because they address the anxieties of their readers, using apocalyptic language to depict a future world in which evildoers are punished, and the faithful reverse the tables on their cultural marginality. The novels, however, also speak to the "here and now," articulating in narrative form the beliefs and actions that place one among either the saved or the damned. The novels accomplish this through the issuance of marks. Both believers and the followers of Antichrist have distinctive marks, which prove less than reliable. At stake, ultimately, is an evangelicalism open to the ambiguity and uncertainty of contemporary life, and a reactive fundamentalism that insists, metaphorically, on the rigidity of marks—a quest for certainty ill-advised in a world characterized by relentless change.*<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but death: "The letter kills, but the spirit [pneuma, breath, producer of speech] gives life." The Son passes through death to resurrected life. The written text, also God's word, must also be resurrected-by interpretation, by being inserted into the lifeworld of living persons. Hermeneutics is resurrection and in common Christian teaching demands faith. Study of the textuality of the Bible-which presumes but is not the same as study of the text of the Bible-opens many new theological questions and / or gives new contours to old questions.<br>

Abstract: America has known, over the years, a number of « Electras », more or less innovative, or faithful to the Greek model. When he wrote his own version, Mourning Becomes Electra, in 1931, Eugene O'Neill wanted to write « a modern psychological play, fate springing out of the family ». In spite of some melodramatic elements, of the predominance of « gloom » over « doom », and of « sorrow » over « mourning », and even though « genes » can't replace « genos », there are moments in which the rebellion, the « splendid failure » of two strong women transcends the anecdote and achieves tragic beauty.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of suspicion which is ultimately reductive in intent, and one which can be said to be ultimately 'recollective'.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: One of the central questions of Jacques Derrida's later writings concerns the sources of religion. At times he gives explicit priority to the universal dimension of religion. In other places, however, he considers the primacy of faith in its concrete, historical context. This paper will clarify Derrida's relationship to universality and historicity by first comparing his notion of "messianicity without messianism" to that of Walter Benjamin's "weak Messianism." After drawing out these differences, I will focus on Derrida's later writings. I will show that much of the ambiguity of Derrida's thinking on religion can be resolved by turning to his work on khōra, the Greek word for "space" or "matter." The rhetoric of khōra can allow us to think through a twofold logic, one that includes the universal/historical distinction and exceeds its alternatives.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses human resources management (HRM) systems and practices in a large multinational management consultancy firm. The firm invests considerable resources in HRM, and is frequently praised by employees for its accomplishments in hiring, developing, and promotion. However, this general faith in HRM does not align particularly well with employees' experiences and perceptions of the specific HRM practices in the firm. The paper critically interprets the meaning and the functions of the HRM system and the beliefs supporting it. The paper suggests a reinterpretation of HRM systems and practices based on a cultural-symbolic perspective. It introduces the concepts of excess ceremonialism, identity projects, and aspirational control to highlight and interpret the significance of organizational symbolism in accounting for the role of HRM systems and practices, and the various effects of HRM systems and practices on employee identity and compliance.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Abstract: This paper continues a dialogue begun in the Focus on Cosmogony and Religious Ethics published in JRE 14/1 (Spring, 1986). There Charles Reynolds and Ronald Green argued for a model of comparative religious ethics that seeks to locate certain "descriptive universals" across cultural boundaries in diverse forms of religious ethics. The present paper argues that this approach is dangerously imbalanced in its emphasis on similarities, ignoring the importance of diversity for interpreting cross-cultural phenomena and tending to impose a heterogeneous conceptual framework on all religious ethical systems examined. Using the case of the Aztec ethic, the paper argues instead for an approach that studies each particular system in depth in its own context. Such an approach, besides being more faithful to each system being examined, also carries the potential of enriching the search for universals by nuancing the description of the patterns being sought.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: A fierce opponent of the historicist approach to literature that dominated French academe during his lifetime, the essayist and poet Charles Péguy (1873–1914) would theorize an alternative literary method that through the act of faithful and participatory reading could transcend the limitations of historicism. Outlined in his dialogue with History, Clio, Péguy's vision of the literary act is that of an intersubjective operation of mutual understanding between reader and author, in which the living relevance of literary works extends beyond their narrow historical origins; a conception that prefigures the formalist and hermeneutic literary approaches that will arise decades later.<br>

Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: The manner in which the LDS Church administers its temple rite constitutes a strategic use of the conventions of an oral tradition in a modern, literate society. Three effects of this strategy are considered. First, refusing to make a text of the rite available and insisting that its specific content not be revealed or otherwise subjected to discursive thought sustains the rite's canonical authority as immutable truth, notwithstanding its periodic mutation. Secondly, the conventions of oral tradition structure the relationships created by the ritual and constitute a principal means by which the Church's historic separatism is maintained. Finally, these conventions when applied to the temple rite maximize ritual's capacity to adapt the canon to the needs of successive generations of the faithful while minimizing skepticism and schism.<br>

Abstract: Starting with Raglan's suggestion that Falstaff may be a "holy fool" and with Auden's belief that he is a comic symbol of charity, this essay explores the medieval tradition of wise fool, and especially Falstaff's always canny use of biblical allusion. His various jests, if read in relation to the political action of the main plot, reveal him as characterizing England's time of day and parodying the unchristian behavior of Hotspur, Henry, and Hal. By the time he dies mumbling Psalm xxiii to an uncomprehending Nell Quickly, there have accumulated many hints that he is, in fact, a candle to his age, a professional Fool with the heart of a faithful Lazarus, and destined to join Mowbray in Abraham's bosom. The merriment for which readers have found him lovable amid his masquerades of vice has its mysterious basis in his covertly Christian understanding of England's neo-Roman Caesars.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I develop a theory of what I call the abeyance of agency, drawing upon a comparison between Fijian Christian church and gift-giving rituals. I argue that from religious practitioners' viewpoint, religious faith concerns not so much the intentions of an anthropomorphic God as the limits that are temporarily placed on ritual participants' agency. Such abeyance and subsequent recovery of their agency enables them to experience the intimations of an ultimate response. [agency, form, temporality, gift exchange, Christianity, Fiji]<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>
