  Corrections and Paradoxes from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1ws7x0t">Intellectual Sacrifice and Other Mimetic Paradoxes</a><br>
  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of

  Book Title: Christianity and the Mass Media in America-Toward a Democratic Accommodation<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Schultze Quentin J.<br>
  Abstract: The mass media and religious groups in America regularly argue about news bias, sex and violence on television, movie censorship, advertiser boycotts, broadcast and film content rating systems, government regulation of the media, the role of mass evangelism in a democracy, and many other issues. In the United States the major disputes between religion and the media usually have involved Christian churches or parachurch ministries, on the one hand, and the so-called secular media, on the other. Often the Christian Right locks horns with supposedly liberal Eastern media elite and Hollywood entertainment companies. When a major Protestant denomination calls for an economic boycott of Disney, the resulting news reports suggest business as usual in the tensions between faith groups and media empires.Schultze demonstrates how religion and the media in America have borrowed each other's rhetoric. In the process, they have also helped to keep each other honest, pointing out respective foibles and pretensions. Christian media have offered the public as well as religious tribes some of the best media criticism- better than most of the media criticism produced by mainstream media themselves. Meanwhile, mainstream media have rightly taken particular churches to task for misdeeds as well as offered some surprisingly good depictions of religious life.The tension between Christian groups and the media in America ultimately is a good thing that can serve the interest of democratic life. As Alexis de Tocqueville discovered in the 1830s, American Christianity can foster the "habits of the heart" that ward off the antisocial acids of radical individualism. And, as John Dewey argued a century later, the media offer some of our best hopes for maintaining a public life in the face of the religious tribalism that can erode democracy from within. Mainstream media and Christianity will always be at odds in a democracy. That is exactly the way it should be for the good of each one.<br>

  Book Title: Reason to Believe-Cultural Agency in Latin American Evangelicalism<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Smilde David<br>
  Abstract: Evangelical Protestantism has arguably become the fastest-growing religion in South America, if not the world. For converts, it emphasizes self-discipline and provides a network of communal support, which together have helped many overcome substance abuse, avoid crime and violence, and resolve relationship problems. But can people simply decide to believe in a religion because of the benefits it reportedly delivers? Based on extensive fieldwork among Pentecostal men in Caracas, Venezuela, this rich urban ethnography seeks an explanation for the explosion of Evangelical Protestantism, unraveling the cultural and personal dynamics of Evangelical conversion to show how and why these men make the choice to convert, and how they come to have faith in a new system of beliefs and practices.<br>

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  Abstract: Pentecostals have always been heavily involved in missions and hold missionaries in high esteem as extraordinary heroes of the faith.¹ But they have traditionally not given as much thought to the topic of theology of religions, or interreligious dialogue and encounter, as to other theological loci.² Why this is the case may be related in part to the fact that academic Pentecostalism is but a recent arrival to the theological scene, with its first generation of professionally trained theologians—as opposed to historians or biblical scholars—emerging only since the early 1990s.³ Yet Pentecostal scholars can no longer avoid giving<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppx1q">Fighting Words</a><br>
  Author(s) Singh Pashaura<br>
  Abstract: There are numerous past and present scholarly debates over interpretations of theological, ritual, and philological issues in the Zoroastrian Avesta, or scriptures, and its
                     Zand, or priestly commentaries. However, unlike for example the raging discussions over the Muslim pillar of faith known asjihād, scholars of the ancient Iranian religion named Zoroastrianism, after its founder Zarathushtra, have rarely broached the issues of just and unjust violence and of holy and sacrilegious war. Combat when examined both by the faith’s practitioners and by scholars is largely understood in terms of theodicy and eschatology linked to the human condition.<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Author(s) Putman Rhyne<br>
  Abstract: The most critical issue for any model of doctrinal development is the question of doctrinal continuity. Can doctrines
                     develop, grow, orprogresswithout compromising their fidelity to “the faith once delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3)? Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

Color, design, beauty, creativity, and wonder are encapsulated—as best they can be—in words. And as best we can, we use our finite words to capture the infinite.

  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Abstract: The terms

In biblical studies, serious interest in myth typically falls under the domain of the secular academy, whereas serious interest in “Scripture” has typically been the concern for communities of faith and the academic institutions they support. This has been most clearly articulated in Robert Oden’sThe Bible without Theology, subtitledThe Theological Tradition and Alternatives to It, in which Oden eschews questions of theology in his treatment of myth, in support of what he refers to as “the process by which biblical study is moving<br>

  Abstract: The spirituality that accompanies a proleptic understanding of the Christian faith is what I call the life of beatitude.

Those who are poor in spirit, or who mourn, or who are meek are blessed in some enigmatic way, says Jesus, because these dispositions somehow anticipate the salvation that God has promised will come.

  Abstract: Every faith community knows the challenges of inviting new members and the next generation into its shared life without falling into an arid traditionalism or a shallow relativism. Renowned scholar Walter Brueggemann finds a framework for education in the structure of the Hebrew Bible canon, with its assertion of center and limit (in the Torah), of challenge (in the Prophets), and of inquiry (in the Writings). Incorporating the best insights from his own career and from the fields of canonical criticism, Old Testament theology, and pedagogical theory, Brueggemann offers a vision of how the community can draw on the shape of Scripture to educate its members. First published in 1982, The Creative Word is now updated and introduced with a foreword by Amy Erickson of Iliff School of Theology.<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodern Apologetics?: Arguments for God in Contemporary Philosophy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an introduction to the emerging field of continental philosophy of religion by treating the thought of its most important representatives, including its appropriations by several thinkers in the United States. Part I provides context by examining religious aspects of the thought of Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida. Christina Gschwandtner contends that, although the work of these thinkers is not apologetic in nature (i.e., it does not provide an argument for religion, whether Christianity or Judaism), it prepares the ground for the more religiously motivated work of more recent thinkers by giving religious language and ideas some legitimacy in philosophical discussions. Part II devotes a chapter to each of the contemporary French thinkers who articulate a phenomenology of religious experience: Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Jean-Louis Chretien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. In it, the author argues that their respective philosophies can be read as an apologetics of sorts-namely, as arguments for the coherence of thought about God and the viability of religious experience-though each thinker does so in a different fashion and to a different degree. Part III considers the three major thinkers who have popularized and extended this phenomenology in the U.S. context: John D. Caputo, Merold Westphal, and Richard Kearney. The book thus both provides an introduction to important contemporary thinkers, many of whom have not yet received much treatment in English, and also argues that their philosophies can be read as providing an argument for Christian faith.<br>

  Abstract: John D. Caputo, recently retired as Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion and Humanities at Syracuse University and David R. Cook Professor Emeritus of philosophy at Villanova University where he taught for many years, is most well-known for his friendship with Derrida and for highlighting the religious dimension of Derrida’s thought. Caputo’s work is perhaps best understood as a form of postmodern hope (especially in contrast to Westphal’s emphasis on faith and Kearney’s concern with charity). Despite being associated so firmly with Derrida, Caputo’s earliest work was on Heidegger, tracing what he called the “mystical dimension” of Heidegger’s thought and<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Abstract: To ask in what ways and to what extent John Donne might have been aware of the dazzling tropes he used would seem a question whose answer is self-evident. Historically, however, this is a real question, and one bearing on faith and ideology. To take an obvious instance, the correspondences invoked so often in Donne’s writing are to us metaphoric fiction, but as extensions of a single, celestial power, hence valid and real parallels, they presumably meant more for Donne and his immediate audience, even in their more skeptical moments.

  Book Title: God's Mirror: Renewal and Engagement in French Catholic Intellectual Culture in the Mid-Twentieth Century-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garfitt Toby<br>
  Abstract: Gathering in one place a cohesive selection of articles that deepen our sense of the vitality and controversy within the Catholic renewal of the mid-twentieth century, God's Mirror offers historical analysis of French Catholic intellectuals. This volume highlights the work of writers, thinkers and creative artists who have not always drawn the attention given to such luminaries as Maritain, Mounier, and Marcel. Organized around the typologies of renewal and engagement, editors Katherine Davies and Toby Garfitt provide a revisionist and interdisciplinary reading of the narrative of twentieth-century French Catholicism. Renewal and engagement are both manifestations of how the Catholic intellectual reflects and takes position on the relationship between the Church, personal faith and the world, and on the increasingly problematic relationship between intellectuals and the Magisterium. A majority of the writings are based on extensive research into published texts, with some occasional archival references, and they give critical insights into the tensions that characterized the theological and political concerns of their subjects.<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

  Book Title: Divine Enticement: Theological Seductions-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MACKENDRICK KARMEN<br>
  Abstract: Theology usually appears to us to be dogmatic, judgmental, condescending, maybe therapeutic, or perhaps downright fantastical-but seldom enticing. Divine Enticement takes as its starting point that the meanings of theological concepts are not so much logical, truth-valued propositions-affirmative or negative-as they are provocations and evocations. Thus it argues for the seductiveness of both theology and its subject-for, in fact, infinite seduction and enticement as the very sense of theological query. The divine name is one by which we are drawn toward the limits of thought, language, and flesh. The use of language in such conceptualization calls more than it designates. This is not a flaw or a result of vagueness or imprecision in theological language but rather marks the correspondence of such language to its subject: that which, outside of or at the limit of our thought, draws us as an enticement to desire, not least to intellectual desire. Central to the text is the strange semiotics of divine naming, as a call on that for which there cannot be a standard referent. The entanglement of sign and body, not least in interpretations of the Christian incarnation, both grounds and complicates the theological abstractions. A number of traditional notions in Christian theology are reconceived here as enticements, modes of drawing the desires of both body and mind: faith as "thinking with assent"; sacraments as "visible words" read in community; ethics as responsiveness to beauty; prayer as the language of address; scripture as the story of meaning-making. All of these culminate in a sense of a call to and from the purely possible, the open space into which we can be enticed, within which we can be divinely enticing.<br>

  Author(s): Park Albert L.<br>
  Abstract: Why and how did Korean religious groups respond to growing rural poverty, social dislocation, and the corrosion of culture caused by forces of modernization under strict Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945)? Questions about religion's relationship and response to capitalism, industrialization, urbanization, and secularization lie at the heart of understanding the intersection between colonialism, religion, and modernity in Korea. Yet, getting answers to these questions has been a challenge because of narrow historical investigations that fail to study religious processes in relation to political, economic, social, and cultural developments. In
      Building a Heaven on Earth, Albert L. Park studies the progressive drives by religious groups to contest standard conceptions of modernity and forge a heavenly kingdom on the Korean peninsula to relieve people from fierce ruptures in their everyday lives. The results of his study will reconfigure the debates on colonial modernity, the origins of faith-based social activism in Korea, and the role of religion in a modern world.<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Book Title: Joy and Human Flourishing-Essays on Theology, Culture, and the Good Life<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Volf Miroslav<br>
  Abstract: Joy is crucial to human life and central to God’s relationship to the world, yet it is remarkably absent from contemporary theology and, increasingly, from our own lives! This collection, the result of a series of consultations hosted by the Yale Center of Faith and Culture, remedies this situation by considering the import of joy on human flourishing. These essays—written by experts in systematic and pastoral theology, Christian ethics, and biblical studies—demonstrate the promise of joy to throw open new theological possibilities and cast fresh light on all dimensions of human life. With contributions from Jurgen Moltmann, N. T. Wright, Marianne Meye Thompson, Mary Clark Moschella, Charles Mathewes, and Miroslav Volf, this volume puts joy at the heart of Christian faith and life, exploring joy’s biblical, dogmatic, ecclesiological, and ethical dimensions in concert with close attention to the shifting tides of culture. Convinced of the need to offer to the world a compelling Christian vision of the good life, the authors treat the connections between joy and themes of creation, theodicy, politics, suffering, pastoral practice, eschatology, and more, driven by the conviction that vital relationship with the living God is integral to our fullest flourishing as human creatures.<br>

  Abstract: In the second century ce, Tertullian asked the question, “What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem?”¹ It is a question that has continued to echo through the learned books and journals, the lecture halls and classrooms of theological institutions in the ensuing centuries. What is the relationship, if any, between philosophical reason, captured by the symbol of Athens, the home of Greek philosophy, and Christian faith, captured in the symbol of Jerusalem? Whatever one might think of the question and its theoretical answers, historically there has been a strong tendency for philosophical questions and issues to arise within the<br>

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Abstract: A number of texts in the Scriptures present death as irremediable (see Pss 49:20; 88:9; Job 7:9–10; 14:7–22), but for Dan 12 and the “intertestamental” literature, faith in resurrection is a certainty (see 1 Enoch 51:1; 92:3–5; 2 Macc 7; 14:46; Wis. Sol. 2–4; 4 Ezra 7:32). In Jesus’s time, most Jews believed in the resurrection of the dead. Mark 12:18–27 (// Luke 20:27–38) reports Jesus’s rebuke of the Sadducees about this issue.¹ The entire New Testament presupposes Jesus’s resurrection.

  Abstract: This chapter contextualizes the claim that French Jews emerged from World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the republican tradition by presenting the opposite case, that of a man whose republican commitment was unshakable and indeed deepened by the war and the Shoah. René Cassin, jurist, international statesman, and one of the authors of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, never lost his faith in the republican project at home and abroad. From 1940 on, he worked to revitalize that tradition, not to discard or refashion it.¹<br>

Seldom has a papacy been so grounded in guiding the conversation between faith and reason and in showing how, in the life of the pope himself, intellectual and spiritual lives are intertwined.<br>

  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

They ask: how could a loving God send the divine Son to be tortured to death? The theology of redemption they have imbibed involves God willing the death of Jesus on a cross as the means of our salvation. The biblical texts which say that Jesus ‘must’ suffer (Mk 8:31; Lk 24:26) are understood to mean that there was a divine requirement for the cruel death on the cross.

  Abstract: In-Between God' explores three important areas for contemporary Christianity: theology, community and discipleship. Part One inquires into the rhythms of faith as it interacts with themes of uncertainty and doubt, the nature of theological discourse, the task of systematic theology, evangelism and the various ways in which theology is done. Part Two discusses the importance of place in relation to the church, and themes of innovation, undecideability and new forms of monastic community. Part Three addresses themes in discipleship: simplicity, mysticism, the passions and pilgrimage. A red thread connecting these essays is the character of the triune God who is the energy and life in between all things.<br>

The voices gathered here from several different traditions-Catholic, Protestant, Quaker, Jewish, and Muslim-represent diverse ethnicities, races, and ages.

This chapter employs a similar strategy regarding self-reflexivity and self-understanding, showing that the for-itself has a proper penultimate status in the life of faith and that the cruciform self is a self-interpreting animal. It is necessary to make this argument given our interpretation of sin as incurvature, which might seem to reinforce the Romantic-idealist interpretation of the fall as a

  Author(s) Neville Robert Cummings<br>
  Abstract: As with all the classical pragmatists, Peirce’s interest in the subject of religion is subordinate to his more central questions. What Peirce has to say about God, creation, the church, faith, and love is systematically derived from a philosophy that, having semiotics at its core, spans a broad range of topics, such as mathematics, logic, epistemology, cosmology, linguistics, and occasionally even bridges design and engineering. It is this subsidiary status that, to my mind, lends methodological soundness as well as modernity to Peirce’s reflections, because the clear implication is that religion is not a primary phenomenon but something that develops<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Abstract: Grace for the Injured Self shows the reader how the 'self psychology' developed by Heinz Kohut can be an influential theory for pastoral care. The late Kohut affirmed that religion is not only an expression of the self, but can also sustain the self in the alliance between faith and grace, with self psychology and empathy. Cooper and Randall articulately explore Kohut's psychoanalytic perspective of 'self psychology', orientated towards pastoral care for parishioners. The authors ascertain how the human condition is affected by 'self injury', and the relationship between this and the traditional notions of sin. Two interviews with Kohut, never before published in the UK, give the reader unique insights into the psychoanalyst who many regard as the most important figure in psychology since Sigmund Freud.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Book Title: The Joshua Delusion?-Rethinking Genocide in the Bible<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Moberly R.W.L.<br>
  Abstract: Many Christians wrestle with biblical passages in which God commands the slaughter of the Canaanites - men, women, and children. The issue of the morality of the biblical God is one of the major challenges for faith today. How can such texts be Holy Scripture? In this bold and innovative book, Douglas Earl grasps the bull by the horns and guides readers to new and unexpected ways of looking at the book of Joshua. Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Abstract: In this new book, Brannon Hancock explores the theme of the "scandalous" sacrament in the context of our current Western culture which some would describe as “post-Christian", and in the light of the Christian churches who hold sacramental life as central to their faith. In the texts addressed by Hancock we return to the body in all its messy complexity, and therefore to the mystery which lies at the very heart of the sacramental incarnation, the Word made Flesh.<br>

  Abstract: We have thus far established that the central corporate act of the Christian
                  ecclesia, from which the Church derives its identity as the Body of Christ and its sacramental structure, is the Eucharist, the participation in Christ’s broken body and shed blood. The Eucharist not only points toward the cross of Christ but toward the entire narrative of the incarnation of God in human body of Jesus of Nazareth. We glimpse the central stumblingblock—what St. Paul calls askandalon—of Christian faith and practice: “we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles” (1 Cor<br>

  Book Title: Justification in a Post-Christian Society-  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Gunner Göran<br>
  Abstract: Since the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Lutheran traditions have impacted culture and politics in many societies. At the same time, Lutheran belief has had an effect on personal faith, morality, and ethics. Modern society, however, is quite different from that at the time of the Reformation. How should we evaluate Lutheran tradition in today’s Western multicultural and post-Christian society? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran theological position that can be regarded as reasonable in a society that evidences a considerable weakening of the role of Christianity? What are the challenges raised by cultural diversity for a Lutheran theology and ethics? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran identity in a multicultural society, and is there any fruitful Lutheran contribution to the coexistence of diff erent religious and non-religious traditions in the future?<br>

  Abstract: This chapter argues that Lutheran theology needs to reflect anew upon the

On the one hand, we have what I call a Protestantism without blood and flesh, in which faith is understood primarily as an individualized attitude of faith and inner freedom vis-à-vis church and society. On the other hand, we have a Protestantism of blood and flesh which knows that faith, hope, and love can only thrive in and through social forms of embodiment. The church, in this understanding, is a place in which a public understanding of the gospel is cultivated,<br>

  Book Title: Grasping Truth and Reality-Lesslie Newbigin's Theology of Mission to the Western World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Le Roy Stults Donald<br>
  Abstract: When Lesslie Newbigin returned to Britain in 1974 after years of missionary service, he observed that his homeland was as much a mission field as India, where he had spent the majority of his missionary career. He concluded that the Western world needed a missionary confrontation. Instead of the traditional approach to missions, however, Newbigin realized that the Western world needed to be confronted theologically. From his earliest days at Cambridge University, Newbigin developed the theological convictions that shaped his understanding of the Christian faith, and he used these theological convictions as criteria to evaluate the belief system of Western culture and to provide an answer to its dilemma. The Enlightenment reintroduced humanism and dualism into Western culture, which resulted on the loss of purpose and the rise of skepticism. This book discusses Newbigin's theological convictions and how they factored into both his critique of and his solution to Western culture's spiritual and worldview problems. Donald Le Roy cleverly explains Newbigin's solution to reintroduce the Christian belief system into Western culture in order to restore purpose and truth to Westerners and put them back in contact with true reality through Jesus Christ.<br>

This collection of essays explores the biblical foundations and the contemporary resonances of lament literature. This new work presents a variety of responses to tragedy and a world out of joint are explored. These responses arise from Scripture, from within the liturgy of the church, and from beyond the church; in contemporary life (the racially conflicted land of Aotearoa- New Zealand, secular music concerts and cyber-space). The book thus reflects upon theological and pastoral handling of such experience, as it bridges these different worlds. It brings together in conversation specialists from different fields of academy and church to provide a resource for integrating faith and scholarship in dark places.<br>

  Book Title: From Faith to Faith-John Wesley’s Covenant Theology and the Way of Salvation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The very title of this volume makes a claim and extends an invitation. Simply put, the claim is this: John Wesley was an adherent of covenant theology. Consequently, a proper understanding of his theological thought - and of his soteriology in particular - is impossible apart from accounting for the influence of covenant theology on him. The invitation then, is to investigate Wesley's thought in light of this claim. Having started his research simply as an investigation into a rather curious distinction Wesley made among those to whom he gave spiritual counsel (some people, he said, have "the faith of a servant"; others have "the faith of a son"), Rodes soon realised that covenant theology was an immensely powerful influence on Wesley's thought, and that he was even able to significantly and creatively adapted it to the template of his evangelical Arminianism.<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rovers Martin<br>
  Abstract: The increased use of and emphasis on managed care, manualized treatment protocols, evidence-based treatments and quick treatments have marginalized the role of the helping relationship in the helping professions. This shift has sparked a debate within the helping professions over whether the helping relationship or technique is primarily responsible for healing and change.
      The Helping Relationshipweighs in on this debate, arguing that healing and change always take place within the context of relationships and that the relationship is more important than the technique. While recognizing the value of techniques, the authors valorize the helping relationship, considering it in unconventional contexts, such as formal education, supervision, and faith communities to show its flexibility and efficacy. This alternative approach adds a new perspective on the helping relationship debate, shedding new light on the roles of relationship and technique in the healing process.<br>

  Book Title: Comparing Faithfully-Insights for Systematic Theological Reflection<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS MICHELLE VOSS<br>
  Abstract: Every generation of theologians must respond to its context by rearticulating the central tenets of the faith. Interreligious comparison has been integral to this process from the start of the Christian tradition and is especially salient today. The emerging field of comparative theology, in which close study of another religious tradition yields new questions and categories for theological reflection in the scholar's home tradition, embodies the ecumenical spirit of this moment. This discipline has the potential to enrich systematic theology and, by extension, theological education, at its foundations. This resource for pastors and theology students reconsiders five central doctrines of the Christian faith in light of focused interreligious investigations. The dialogical format of the book builds conversation about the doctrine of God, theodicy, humanity, Christology, and soteriology. Its comparative essays span examples from Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Muslim, Jain, and Confucian traditions, indigenous Aztec theology, and contemporary "spiritual but not religious" thought, to offer exciting new perspectives on Christian doctrine. The essays in this volume demonstrate that engagement with religious diversity need not be an afterthought in the study of Christian systematic theology; rather, it can be a way into systematic theological thinking. Each section invites students to test theological categories, to consider Christian doctrine in relation to specific comparisons, and to take up comparative study in their own contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

  Book Title: Analogies of Transcendence-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): FIELDS STEPHEN M.<br>
  Abstract: The problem of nature and grace lies at the heart of Christian theology. No dimension of divine revelation can be addressed without implicitly drawing reference to this issue.Analogies of Transcendence focuses on the central role that the analogies of being and faith play in developing a solution to the problem. These link God, as self-manifesting transcendence, to the human person as both fallen and justified, and to the material cosmos. Although the proposed solution draws on the work of Maréchal, de Lubac, Balthasar, and Rahner, it criticizes their approach for its underdeveloped analogies that diminish nature in grace's engagement with it. In redressing this weakness, Fr. Fields adapts its solution to the intellectual struggle of our time. This volume examines the origins and structure of modernity, which, it asserts, has not been superseded and is therefore critical of'‘postmodernism,' as well as of some ambiguous legacies of Thomism.<br>

  Author(s): ABBOTT FRANK A.<br>
  Abstract: There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement? Beating against the Wind, a study in nineteenth-century vernacular spirituality, emphasizes the power of faith on a shifting frontier in a transatlantic world. Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spiritual regimen of order, silence, and solemnity. Whether by outright opposing Bishop Feild, or by simply ignoring his wishes and views, or by brokering a hybrid style of Gothic architecture, the people of Newfoundland and Labrador demonstrated their independence in the face of an attempt at hierarchical ascendency upon the arrival of Tractarianism in British North America. Instead, they continued to practise evangelical Anglicanism and participate in Methodist revivals, and thereby negotiated a popular Protestantism, one often infused with the spirituality of other seafarers from Nova Scotia and New England. Exploring the interaction between popular spirituality and religious authority, Beating against the Wind challenges the traditional claim of Feild’s success in bringing Tractarianism to the colony while exploring the resistance to Feild’s initiatives and the reasons for his disappointments.There are many analyses of Tractarianism – a nineteenth-century form of Anglicanism that emphasized its Catholic origins – but how did people in the colonies react to the High Church movement?

Focusing on people living along the Newfoundland and Labrador coast, Calvin Hollett presents a nuanced perspective on popular resistance to the colonial emissary Bishop Edward Feild and his spir~<br>

  Abstract: At a multi-faith event in the fall of 2005, a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists reclaimed one of the Toronto Islands as “Spirit Island,” reconsecrating and reactivating the land as a sacred site for healing ceremonies and teachings by elders. During that ceremony, an Indigenous elder from Greenland sang a healing song passed down from his great-great-grandmother. He sang it for the sculptor who hoped to create a healing garden for children on the site, which he envisioned as a medicine wheel of sculptures by Indigenous artists. The sculptor spoke of being raised white and only later in life<br>

  Book Title: The Quest for Meaning-Friends of Wisdom from Plato to Levinas<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
  Abstract: One of our most distinguished thinkers, Adriaan Peperzak has masterfully explored the connections between philosophy, ethics, religion, and the social and historical contexts of human experience. He offers a personal gathering of influences on his own work as guides to the uses of philosophy in our search for sense and meaning. In concise, direct, and deeply felt chapters, Peperzak moves from Plato, Plotinus, and the Early Christian theologians to Anselm, Bonaventure, Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, Hegel, and Levinas. Throughout these carefully linked essays, he touches on the fundamental ideas-from reason and faith to freedom and tradition-that inform the questions his work has consistently addressed, most specifically those concerning philosophy as a practice.<br>

  Abstract: From its inception in Kant’s striving to imagine a “religion within the limits of reason alone,” the Continental tradition has maintained a strict division of labor between theological and philosophical reflection on religion.

  Abstract: Images in literary works are words that appeal to the senses to conjure up a corresponding picture in the mind of the reader. By definition, such images appeal to the reader’s imagination, which has the capacity both to visualize and to interpret. The Gospel of John uses a remarkable number of sensory images to tell its story and express its unique perspective on faith. Many of these images, through the course of the Johannine narrative, take on the character of religious symbols: vehicles of the divine world.

  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Abstract: When people endure times of crisis or trauma, they often search for meaning and hope by engaging in a bidirectional reading of texts. One direction involves hearing, reading, or witnessing the stories of others in analogous circumstances. Doing so can help people to know that they are not alone in their suffering, thus fulfilling Donne’s axiom that “no man is an island, entire of itself.”¹ The other direction points toward texts and rituals in one’s religious faith and spiritual practices, seeking a linkage between one’s own story and a larger, transcendent story: one that recounts what is sacred or ultimate.<br>

  Author(s): Ormsby Eric<br>
  Abstract: In
      Rethinking Islam, Katajun Amirpur argues that the West's impression of Islam as a backward-looking faith, resistant to post-Enlightenment thinking, is misleading and-due to its effects on political discourse-damaging. Introducing readers to key thinkers and activists-such as Abu Zaid, a free-thinking Egyptian Qur'an scholar; Abdolkarim Soroush, an academic and former member of Khomeini's Cultural Revolution Committee; and Amina Wadud, an American feminist who was the first woman to lead the faithful in Friday Prayer-Amirpur reveals a powerful yet lesser-known tradition of inquiry and dissent within Islam, one that is committed to democracy and human rights. By examining these and many other similar figures' ideas, she reveals the many ways they reject fundamentalist assertions and instead call for a diversity of opinion, greater freedom, and equality of the sexes.<br>

  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: In this vitally important book, fifteen influential practitioners of the Abrahamic religions address religious liberty and tolerance from the perspectives of their own faith traditions. Former President Jimmy Carter, Rabbi Arik Ascherman, Indonesia's first democratically elected president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and the other writers draw on their personal experiences and on the sacred writings that are central in their own religious lives. Rather than relying on "pure reason," as secularists might prefer, the contributors celebrate religious traditions and find within them a way toward mutual peace, uncompromised liberty, and principled tolerance. Offering a counterbalance to incendiary religious leaders who cite Holy Writ to justify intolerance and violence, the contributors reveal how tolerance and respect for believers in other faiths stands at the core of the Abrahamic traditions.<br>

  Book Title: The God of All Flesh-and Other Essays<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hanson K.C.<br>
  Abstract: Biblical faith is passionately and relentlessly material in its emphasis. This claim is rooted in the conviction that the creator God loves the creation and summons creation to be in sync with the will of the creator God. This collection of essays is focussed on the bodily life of the world as it ordered in all of its problematic political and economic forms. The phrase of the title “all flesh" in the flood narrative of Genesis 9 refers to all living creatures who are in covenant with God – human beings, animals, birds, and fish – as recipients of God’s grace, as dependent upon God’s generosity, and as destined for praise and obedience to God. The insistence on the materiality of life as the subject of the Bible means that the difficult issues of economics and the demanding questions of politics are front and centre in the text. So the Pentateuch pivots around the Exodus narrative and the emancipation from an unbearable context of abusive labour practices. In a similar manner, the prophets endlessly address such questions of social policy and the wisdom teachers reflect on how to manage the material things of life and social relationships for the well-being of the community. This emphasis, pervasive in these essays, is a powerful alternative and a strong resistance against all of the contemporary efforts to transcend (escape!) the material into some form of the “spiritual". All around us are efforts to find an easier, more harmonious faith. This may be evoked simply because of a desire to shield economic, political advantage from the inescapable critique of biblical faith. Such a temptation is a serious misreading of the Bible and a critical misjudgment about the nature of human existence. Thus the Bible addressed the most urgent issues of our day, and refuses the “religious temptation" that avoids lived reality where the power of God is a work.<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

  Abstract: This paper aims to understand the meaning and role that Jaspers attributes to worldviews. By analysing the nature of the
                  Weltanschauungen, the paper shows how Jaspers, inspired by Dilthey, alludes to a fundamental stratum of the Weltanschauung that goes beyond every objective construction, every shell (Gehäuse) and every doctrine, and which is identified with the process of the existential experience. The antinomicity of the lived process and the ambiguity that characterises the worldviews becomes clearer where Jaspers introduces the notion of limit situation. By analysing the relationship between theWeltanschauungenand the philosophical faith, the paper shows that theWeltanschauungen<br>

  Abstract: Engraved by Philips galle after Pieter Bruegel, the

  Abstract: Scholars of Wallace Stevens have long recognized that his poetics is bound up with the loss of religious faith. The standard critical picture is that, like many Victorians before him, Stevens gave up certain consolatory beliefs in the “supernatural” and looked to poetry to fill the vacuum of “meaning.” Stevens himself wrote bluntly in a letter of mid-career: “[I]t is a habit of mind with me to be thinking of some substitute for religion” (L, 348 ). Critics have usually proceeded, however, as if the terms of Stevens’s secularism were self-evident and the transitional movement between religion and poetry—“substitution”<br>

  Book Title: Stories of the Middle Space-Reading the Ethics in Postmodern Realisms<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Bowen Deborah C.<br>
  Abstract: Highlighting the wide variety of ethical concerns considered by writers such as Timothy Findley, Thomas King, Carol Shields, Julian Barnes, A.S. Byatt, and Salman Rushdie, Deborah Bowen makes the case for a new category of "postmodern realism" and shows how contemporary stories about "the real" and "the good" are constructed. Applying theoretical insights from Emmanuel Levinas and Mikhail Bakhtin, Bowen investigates categories of postmodern realism such as magic realism, parody, and metafiction while laying the groundwork for Christian readings of a medium that is often perceived as largely irreligious. An illuminating study of well-known contemporary writers, Stories of the Middle Space is a critically nuanced and methodologically innovative work that reads the postmodern from a faith-based perspectives to create new literary insights.<br>

She understands Christian stories and symbols as fictional but still powerful. When she writes in her key essay on Van Gogh that we all make sense out of our life experiences by using the myths and fictions of our ancestors, she adds that “we play, in a sense, with so few essentials, since the myths became defined as fictions”<br>

  Book Title: Redescribing the Gospel of Mark-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Merrill P.<br>
  Abstract: This final volume of studies by members of the Society of Biblical Literature's consultation, and later seminar, on Ancient Myths and Modern Theories of Christian Origins focuses on Mark. As with previous volumes, the provocative proposals on Christian origins offered by Burton L. Mack are tested by applying Jonathan Z. Smith's distinctive social theorizing and comparative method. Essays examine Mark as an author's writing in a book culture, a writing that responded to situations arising out of the first Roman-Judean war after the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 CE. Contributors William E. Arnal, Barry S. Crawford, Burton L. Mack, Christopher R. Matthews, Merrill P. Miller, Jonathan Z. Smith, and Robyn Faith Walsh explore the southern Levant as a plausible provenance of the Gospel of Mark and provide a detailed analysis of the construction of Mark as a narrative composed without access to prior narrative sources about Jesus. A concluding retrospective follows the work of the seminar, its developing discourse and debates, and the continuing work of successor groups in the field.<br>

  Book Title: How to Do Comparative Theology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VON STOSCH KLAUS<br>
  Abstract: For a generation and more, the contribution of Christian theology to interreligious understanding has been a subject of debate. Some think of theological perspectives are of themselves inherently too narrow to support interreligious learning, and argue for an approach that is neutral or, on a more popular level, grounded simply open-minded direct experience. In response, comparative theology argues that theology, as faith seeking understanding, offers a vital perspective and a way of advancing interreligious dialogue, aided rather than hindered by commitments; theological perspectives can both complement and step beyond the study of religions by methods detached and merely neutral. Thus comparative theology has been successful in persuading many that interreligious learning from one faith perspective to another is both possible and worthwhile, and so the work of comparative theology has become more recognized and established globally. With this success there has come to the fore new challenges regarding method: How does one do comparative theological work in a way that is theologically grounded, genuinely open to learning from the other, sophisticated in pursuing comparisons, and fruitful on both the academic and practical levels?<br>

  Book Title: Vatican II and Beyond-The Changing Mission and Identity of Canadian Women Religious<br>

  Author(s): Smyth Elizabeth M.<br>
  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world. Over the last five decades, women religious have engaged with the council’s reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeding the expectations of the Church. Addressing how Canadian women religious envisioned and lived out the changes in religious life brought on by a pluralistic and secularizing world, Vatican II and Beyond analyzes the national organization of female and male congregations, the Canadian Religious Conference, and the lives of two individual sisters: visionary congregational leader Alice Trudeau and social justice activist Mary Alban. This book focuses on the new transnational networks, feminist concepts, professionalization of religious life, and complex political landscapes that emerged during this period of drastic transition as women religious sought to reconstruct identities, redefine roles, and signify vision and mission at both the personal and collective levels. Following women religious as they encountered new meanings of faith in their congregations, the Church, and society at large, Vatican II and Beyond demonstrates that the search for a renewed vision was not just a response to secularization, but a way to be reborn as Catholic women.The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second Vatican Council, which aimed to align the Church with the modern world.

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Abstract: Merold Westphal is considered to be one of the preeminent Continental philosophers of religion. His articulation of faith as the task of a lifetime has become a touchstone in contemporary debates concerning faith's relationship to reason. As Justin Sands explores his philosophy, he illuminates how Westphal's concept of faith reveals the pastoral, theological intent behind his thinking. Sands sees Westphal's philosophy as a powerful articulation of Protestant theology, but one that is in ecumenical dialogue with questions concerning apologetics and faith's relationship to ethics and responsibility, a more Catholic point of view. By bringing out these features in Westphal's philosophy, Sands intends to find core philosophical methodologies as well as a passable bridge for philosophers to cross over into theological discourses.<br>

  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: For various complicated motives (sometimes too unpleasant to discuss, even when they are suspected), Christianity has been often regarded (and sometimes still is) by many as a religion of victory, of triumph, of battles won, and of domination (early on Origen felt obliged to combat this erroneous understanding). Such an impression was encouraged among other things by the impressively swift spread of this faith on all continents of our planet: in its first few centuries around the Mediterranean basin; thereafter for another few centuries throughout Europe, among the immigrant tribes massively settling here; finally, during the latest half-millennium, on all<br>

  Abstract: In part 3, we are examining the relationship between the 
                  sensus fidelium, theology, and the magisterium in the teaching office of the church. Determination of the sensus fidei fidelium, and its significance for theology and the magisterium, necessarily demands prior attention to the sensus fidei fidelis, the sense of the faith of the individual believer. Such an investigation includes both lay and ordained, bishops and theologians, since they are all individual fideles (“from the bishops to the last of the faithful”).¹ Therefore, before we consider determination of the communal sensus fidelium, this chapter examines the locus, context, mode, norm, and<br>

  Book Title: Building a Better Bridge-Muslims, Christians, and the Common Good<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ipgrave Michael<br>
  Abstract: Building a Better Bridgeis a record of the fourth "Building Bridges" seminar held in Sarajevo in 2005 as part of an annual symposium on Muslim-Christian relations cosponsored by Georgetown University and the Archbishop of Canterbury. This volume presents the texts of the public lectures with regional presentations on issues of citizenship, religious believing and belonging, and the relationship between government and religion-both from the immediate situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and from three contexts further afield: Britain, Malaysia, and West Africa. Both Christian and Muslim scholars propose key questions to be faced in addressing the issue of the common good. How do we approach the civic sphere as believers in particular faiths and as citizens of mixed societies? What makes us who we are, and how do our religious and secular allegiances relate to one another? How do we accommodate our commitment to religious values with acknowledgment of human disagreement, and how can this be expressed in models of governance and justice? How are we, mandated by scriptures to be caretakers, to respond to the current ecological and economic disorder of our world? Michael Ipgrave and his contributors do not claim to provide definitive answers to these questions, but rather they further a necessary dialogue and show that, while Christian and Islamic understandings of God may differ sharply and perhaps irreducibly, the acknowledgment of one another as people of faith is the surest ground on which to build trust, friendship, and cooperation.<br>

(From the Greek δoκέω, “to seem,” docetism, which was the first great challenge to Christological faith, alleges that Christ only

Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Author(s) HAUERWAS STANLEY<br>
  Abstract: Christian faith evokes diverse and sometimes competing images and associations. For some, it conjures up a fairly coherent, albeit complexly interrelated array of experiences, dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs. For others, faith names not so much the defining subjective features of religious consciousness as the objective content of Christian religion. Faith is thus construed as a set of doctrines, a peculiar body of teaching and instruction. In short, faith is a divine “deposit” — with the church or the Bible acting as its repository.<br>

His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

First, it will be shown that Qohelet was not as heterodox as some have maintained. Actually, he represents a return to a more primitive form of the Israelite religion and faith. He utilizes minor elements of traditional wisdom to construct his theological position, which means that he simply reconfigures traditional wisdom. Second, it will be demonstrated that<br>

  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Abstract: Within the modern West we have learnt to think of the Enlightenment as a secular project which claims to think of individuals as rational selves. Where faith was positioned within pre-modern societies which were organised around tradition, we learnt within an Enlightenment vision of modernity to find reason. People were no longer expected to accept beliefs as a matter of faith but could confidently expect to have to prove their beliefs according to reason. This helped radically to redefine the relationship between public and private spheres and religious belief became a matter of individual choice alone. So it was that<br>

He would simply become more accomplished in his own idiom; the language in which he spoke of his own universe would become increasingly more precise and sophisticated. This maturity manifested itself in the clarity with which he spoke of the world, of faith, of people, of society. This was true even of his seemingly contradictory views on Christianity<br>

  Author(s) WUTHNOW ROBERT<br>
  Abstract: Talk of the relations between “science” and “religion” first became audible in the early 1800s, about the time that students of nature began referring to their work as science rather than natural philosophy (or natural history). Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

Korea was no exception.

  Abstract: Christian Political Ethicsbrings together leading Christian scholars of diverse theological and ethical perspectives--Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, and Anabaptist--to address fundamental questions of state and civil society, international law and relations, the role of the nation, and issues of violence and its containment. Representing a unique fusion of faith-centered ethics and social science, the contributors bring into dialogue their own varying Christian understandings with a range of both secular ethical thought and other religious viewpoints from Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism. They explore divergent Christian views of state and society--and the limits of each. They grapple with the tensions that can arise within Christianity over questions of patriotism, civic duty, and loyalty to one's nation, and they examine Christian responses to pluralism and relativism, globalization, and war and peace. Revealing the striking pluralism inherent to Christianity itself, this pioneering volume recasts the meanings of Christian citizenship and civic responsibility, and raises compelling new questions about civil disobedience, global justice, and Christian justifications for waging war as well as spreading world peace. It brings Christian political ethics out of the churches and seminaries to engage with today's most vexing and complex social issues.<br>

Historically, of course, Christianity—or, rather, Christians—have said different and sometimes quite contradictory things on these topics. Some have considered each nation to be specially ordained by the eternal God, while others have stressed the mutable historicality of national compositions and boundaries.¹ Some have virtually equated loyalty to the nation with loyalty to God, while others have regarded it as inimical to pacific, universalist Christian faith.

Faced with a conflict, in other words, we should aim to reach a balanced accommodation with our enemies, and this means negotiating with them in good faith.

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Abstract: Modern American jurisprudential studies began when the dean of Harvard University Law School, Christopher Columbus Langdell, published the first modern law school casebook, Selection of Cases on the Law of Contracts, in 1871. Langdell’s casebook ushered in the modern era because it offered a new methodology and pedagogy for law study that was nothing more than an expression of faith in the scientific method. He declared in the preface to his Contracts casebook: “It is indispensable to establish at least two things, first that law is a science; secondly that all the available materials of that science are contained in<br>

  Abstract: To most outsiders who have heard of Rabbi Mordechai Breuer’s “theory of aspects” (
                     torat ha-behinot), Breuer is a dark figure who has devised for his rigorously Orthodox confreres a counterapproach to biblical criticism so potent that they now thrive on the data that should be poisoning their faith, like bacilli that have evolved resistance to antibiotics. Alternatively, he is seen as one who has constructed a halfway house where academically mobile refugees from Orthodoxy can measure themselves for the trappings of biblical criticism on their way up to some form of orthopraxy. Both are correct.<br>

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Stanton wrote this daring, breathtaking overview of women’s history before this was a subject in which scholars worked. Imagining women as important actors shaping the destiny of humanity was an act of faith, necessary for her to challenge historians to approach their work with an enlarged understanding of how societies advanced. She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies. Stanton’s methodology suggests her sympathy for new positivist trends in history that were concerned with reconstructing patterns of everyday life rather than narrating the stories of kings,<br>

  Book Title: Religious Imaginaries-The Liturgical and Poetic Practices of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): DIELEMAN KAREN<br>
  Abstract: Religious Imaginariesexplores liturgical practice as formative for how three Victorian women poets imagined the world and their place in it and, consequently, for how they developed their creative and critical religious poetics. In doing so, this new study rethinks several assumptions in the field: that Victorian women's faith commitments tend to limit creativity; that the contours of church experiences matter little for understanding religious poetry; and that gender is more significant than liturgy in shaping women's religious poetry.Exploring the import of bodily experience for spiritual, emotional, and cognitive forms of knowing, Karen Dieleman explains and clarifies the deep orientations of different strands of nineteenth-century Christianity, such as Congregationalism's high regard for verbal proclamation, Anglicanism and Anglo-Catholicism's valuation of manifestation, and revivalist Roman Catholicism's recuperation of an affective aesthetic. Looking specifically at Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Adelaide Procter as astute participants in their chosen strands of Christianity, Dieleman reveals the subtle textures of these women's religious poetry: the different voices, genres, and aesthetics they create in response to their worship experiences. Part recuperation, part reinterpretation, Dieleman's readings highlight each poet's innovative religious poetics.Dieleman devotes two chapters to each of the three poets: the first chapter in each pair delineates the poet's denominational practices and commitments; the second reads the corresponding poetry.Religious Imaginarieshas appeal for scholars of Victorian literary criticism and scholars of Victorian religion, supporting its theoretical paradigm by digging deeply into primary sources associated with the actual churches in which the poets worshipped, detailing not only the liturgical practices but also the architectural environments that influenced the worshipper's formation.

  Author(s) Janz Bruce B.<br>
  Abstract: Much of Continental philosophy of religion is reflection on faith (as response to revelation) and reason (as philosophical reflection). Having made the linguistic turn, it intersects with analytic discussion of the problem of religious language, at least if the question is understood as concerning the nature and limits of our God-talk rather than its warrant. Since philosophy often takes the form of phenomenology, the question can be put this way: does reason, so conceived, prescribe the limits within which our Godtalk must stay (as in Kant’s

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

In fact, for countless premodern Europeans during the Middle Ages and beyond, belief in God’s divine plan served as an organizing principle through which they understood themselves and their world.

  Book Title: Understanding Health Inequalities and Justice-New Conversations across the Disciplines<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): Walker Rebecca L.<br>
  Abstract: The need for informed analyses of health policy is now greater than ever. The twelve essays in this volume show that public debates routinely bypass complex ethical, sociocultural, historical, and political questions about how we should address ideals of justice and equality in health care. Integrating perspectives from the humanities, social sciences, medicine, and public health, this volume illuminates the relationships between justice and health inequalities to enrich debates.
      Understanding Health Inequalities and Justiceexplores three questions: How do scholars approach relations between health inequalities and ideals of justice? When do justice considerations inform solutions to health inequalities, and how do specific health inequalities affect perceptions of injustice? And how can diverse scholarly approaches contribute to better health policy? From addressing patient agency in an inequitable health care environment to examining how scholars of social justice and health care amass evidence, this volume promotes a richer understanding of health and justice and how to achieve both.The contributors are Judith C.

  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: The Highway of Despairfollows Theodor Adorno, Georges Bataille, and Frantz Fanon as they each read, resist, and reconfigure a strand of thought in Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit. Confronting the twentieth-century collapse of a certain revolutionary dialectic, these thinkers struggle to revalue critical philosophy and recast Left Hegelianism within the contexts of genocidal racism, world war, and colonial domination. Each thinker also re-centers the role of passion in critique. Arguing against more recent trends in critical theory that promise an escape from despair, Marasco shows how passion frustrates the resolutions of reason and faith.

  Abstract: No single thinker has done more to shape the idea of critical theory in the postwar period than Jürgen Habermas. As I see things, Habermas turns away from a potential project opened up by the thinkers considered in this study—not just Adorno, to whom his connection is obvious, but also Bataille, of whom he is substantially more critical, and Fanon, about whom he says nothing. In recent years, Habermas has turned his attention to questions pertaining to philosophy and religion, the relationship between reason and faith, and the connection between postmetaphysical thinking and theological endeavors. These inquiries are exciting,<br>

  Abstract: While the antinomian movements in England were central to our understanding of Blake, one may ask how influential they were for Blavatsky, who was born and raised in Russia in the Orthodox Church. The late nineteenth century did not make it easy to be an antirationalist as Blake was. It was not only the impact of science that began to erode the field of visionary religion but also a galaxy of philosophers and thinkers who questioned the intellectual legitimacy of the Christian faith. This was the era of Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, of Auguste Comte and Ernest Renan,<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

After all, there are other, well-known passages in Nietzsche’s more mature work where he speaks of the creation of new gods. Let me remark that when announcing the death of God, Nietzsche anticipates that the latter’s shadow will continue to be cast upon our world for a long<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: In a remarkable book that is at once learned, startlingly original, and highly personal, Ann W. Astell explores the ambiguity of the phrase "eating beauty." The phrase evokes the destruction of beauty, the devouring mouth of the grave, the mouth of hell. To eat beauty is to destroy it. Yet in the case of the Eucharist the person of faith who eats the Host is transformed into beauty itself, literally incorporated into Christ. In this sense, Astell explains, the Eucharist was "productive of an entire 'way' of life, a virtuous life-form, an artwork, with Christ himself as the principal artist." The Eucharist established for the people of the Middle Ages distinctive schools of sanctity-Cistercian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Ignatian-whose members were united by the eucharistic sacrament that they received.<br>

  Abstract: Near the beginning of the sixteenth century, Martin Luther found new meaning in the Pauline expression 
                  justification by faith through the hermeneutic concept sola scriptura. Luther’s theological discovery inspired others to articulate and invoke fundamental religious, political, and cultural changes within the European societies. At the same time, the Protestant Reformation gave rise to a tension between a religious and a humanistic outlook. Many solutions put forward to overcome this tension were informed by fear or fascination and appear to us as reactionary or progressive. Such figures as Paracelsus, Erasmus, Trithemius occupied a place between the strict confines of religion<br>

As a quick perusal of recent volumes on European communities shows, astute anthropologists can use identity as a general framing device for a surprising variety of ethnographic data. In these books discussion can span from the individual to the regional to the supranational, from styles of dress or dance to religious faith. The range of possible topics seems to be limited only by the imaginative power of the compiler. The worry, of course, is that we anthropologists may well<br>

  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

Abstract: How might a commitment to political liberalism be maintained when people generally have a greater commitment to their more particular cultural and religious values? This collection of essays would have liberalism compromise from the outset: “A liberal political order needs to somehow find peace with social institutions and practices based on belief and moral tradition ” (p. xii). The contributors propose expanding the role of religion in public life (Jean Bethke Elshtain), inculcating a stronger sense of patriotic citizenship (Walter Berns), and promoting individual virtue (Douglas J. Den Uyl). Many of the essays argue that since religion is the genesis of fundamental liberal ideals, such as equal respect for persons, political liberalism ultimately must rely for its justification on core religious values. This kind of argument is fallacious: we may reasonably hold certain values even if we come to reject a formerly accepted basis for those values. Loss of faith in religious dictates still leaves a prohibition against killing, for instance, with the support of good public reasons. But these essays do serve as a guide to the apprehensions of philosophical and political commentators frustrated by what they see as contemporary liberalism in theory and practice.<br>

Abstract: “On ne se détache pas du merveilleux, quand une fois on lui a donné sa créance, et pendant longtemps on s’acharne à rationaliser la merveille plutôt qu’à la réduire.”
         122Gaston Bachelard’s astute observation on the difficulty of dissolving wonder may sum up the history of attempts at naturalizing the resurrection. Yet the raising of the dead is a special case. It may be, if it ever happens, the wonder of wonders, but it also stands apart from the natural and preternatural marvels the Enlightenment sought to discredit and domesticate.123The criteria of testimony used to judge miracles or extraordinary phenomena can apply only indirectly to an event supposed to be outside time and space and one supposed to signal the end of nature and the universe. Although the intrinsic plausibility of resurrection could be questioned, belief in its probability or certainty did not count as the superstitious or “enthusiastic” product of a diseased imagination. The Enlightenment contributed to make the miraculous less prominent in theology and faith and to leave it behind as a silent and unsettled question on the edges of culture, ignored, like marvels, rather than debunked. In the process, the body was lost.<br>

Abstract: This was a proud list for Old England; and the account of their lives, their zeal, their eloquence and sufferings for conscience sake, is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of the human mind. How high it can soar in faith! How nobly it can arm itself with resolution and fortitude! How far it can surpass itself in cruelty and fraud! How incapable it seems to be of good, except as it is urged on by the contention of evil! The retired and inflexible descendants of the Two Thousand Ejected Ministers and their adherents are gone with the spirit of persecution that gave a body and soul to them; and with them, I am afraid, the spirit of liberty, of manly independence, and of inward self‐respect is nearly extinguished in England.

Abstract: But are there not objections to be made? For example, following Heidegger, one could assimilate the biblical definition according to image and likeness to the Greek definition according to the possession of λόγος in order to understand both as imposing upon man the mode of Being “im Sinne des Vorhandensein” (“in the sense of subsistence [occurring and Being‐present‐at‐hand]”).
         40But what proof does Heidegger give of the equivalence between these two definitions? If necessary, the definition by λόγος could fall under reproach; but does the definition according to the image of God not exclude, precisely, anything having to do, in God and thus in man, with Being as subsistence (vorhanden)? Unless, that is, Heidegger includes neither definition in the division of finite being from infinite being.41But there too, does he not take up, as if it goes without saying, the metaphysical distinction par excellence of theensintofinitumandinfinitum, introduced by Duns Scotus through to Suarez, without seeing that this distinction doubtless contradicts the incomprehensibility of the image and likeness? Does he simply want, in the end, to deny theology the right to tackle the question of man’s status, just as he denies it that of responding to the question, “Why is there something rather than nothing?” by holding that “anyone for whom the Bible is divine revelation and truth already has the answer to the question … before it is asked: beings, with the exception of God Himself, are created by Him. God Himself ‘is’ as the uncreated Creator.” This remains, Heidegger believes, unacceptable, because “one who holds on to such faith as a basis can, perhaps, emulate and participate in the asking of our question in a certain way, but he cannot authentically question. … He can act only ‘as if’ [nun so tun `as ob'] … in the beginning God created heaven and earth, etc.’”42This argument presupposes in its turn that, by invoking creation, the believer confidently knows and thus comprehen~<br>

Abstract: Before we too hastily dismiss the indictment for its Enlightenment naivete, let us consider what it means generically to posit the communicational motive as supreme. Here rhetoric itself will assist us by providing a set of terms with which we can begin to construct a generic analysis of information genres. In a famous passage of his
         Institutio oratoria,Quintilian speaks of three aims of rhetoric, which he namesdocere, delectare, movere.34These terms resonated down through the centuries, but for our purposes we must emphasize the connection betweenmovereand persuasion. When the auditor is moved to believe or act as the orator desires, this is persuasion; but the orator seldom persuades without also instructing and pleasing. Information genres by contrast discard the strategy ofdelectareas a good‐faith gesture and distance the motive of persuasion in favor of permitting a certain instruction to speak for itself. It is not that for the writer of the document there exists no desire to persuade, but that persuasion is implicit indocere,in simply transmitting information.35<br>

Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Christof Mandry’s recent book reopens this debate about Christian ethics, explores some of the terrain of the historical debate, and then tries to press the discussion forward. Originally written as a thesis under the direction of Dietmar Mieth, himself a contributor to this debate, Mandry's book provides a solid, if somewhat schematic, account of the lines of contention even as he makes an important contribution to the discussion within the European, especially German, context by drawing on fresh resources. Thematically, the book is divided into two parts. Part 1 explores the question of theological and philosophical ethics by examining in some detail exemplary positions. Mandry explores within Roman Catholic theology both the work of Franz Böckles, whose
      Fundamentalmoral(New York: Pueblo Publishing, 1980) offered a transcendental account of the theonomous autonomy, and that of Klaus Demmers, who insists on the “effective history” of faith on reason. Mandry then examines an analogous debate among Protestants by examining, specifically, Gerhard Ebeling’s account of moral conscience and Wolfhart Pannenberg’s argument for a distinctly theological grounding of ethics. The fact that thinkers from the various sides of the Christian tradition could reach such starkly different positions while drawing on strands of their own communions is of course important to note. Throughout, Mandry’s readings are fair and insightful.<br>

Abstract: Given Tesauro’s insistence on St. Maurice, let us mention only the main points of his life. The crucial document regarding the martyr Maurice and his companions is
      Passio Acaunensium martyrumby the bishop of Lyon Eucherius (450–55).65Maurice’s “blessed passion,” Eucherius writes, took place under the Emperor Maximian (AD 250–310), who “slaughtered and murdered” the followers of the Christian faith in different provinces of the empire.66At that time, Eucherius continues, within the emperor’s army existed a legion called “Theban, made of six‐thousand six‐hundred soldiers.”67When this legion arrived in Agaunum (St. Moritz today, in Switzerland), Maurice and his companions refused to engage in pagan sacrifices because they themselves were Christian. The emperor massacred this disloyal legion. The Savoy order of “Maurice and Lazarus” was under the aegis of this model of military allegiance to the true faith. The transfer of parts of Maurice’s body to the Turinese cathedral where the shroud also found its abode was a highly symbolic act, as if the saint’s relics and the Word’s shroud were meant to reside in the same sacred place. The shroud and the relics would enhance each other’s significance, and together they would bless the royal family of Savoy.<br>

Abstract: Frei highlights several crucial features of Phillips’s views: first, the meaning of religious language is grounded in the way of life and practice of the believer—the language therefore takes on a meaning incommensurable with the ways that a philosopher (or a believer in a different faith tradition) would understand it. Second, because of this incommensurability, the work of philosophy can only be to clarify the distinction between different uses of language; it is only from within the terms and practices of a community that one can judge one use of language to be “better” than another, and this judgment is made solely through practice. In Frei’s view, Phillips effectively effaces the possibility of Christian self‐description that would explain why one formulation of doctrine is better than another, by “absolutizing and rigidifying the warranted, indeed essential, distinction between religious statements and statements about religion.”
         32This effaces the possibility of self‐description because the best way to understand—perhaps, really, the only way to understand—is through deeper practice. It is, in a sense, as if upon expressing incomprehension regarding the incarnation, one were told to simply pray harder. The hard and fast distinction between religious utterances and statements about religion leads, on Frei’s view, to the collapse of the distinction between second‐order and first‐order religious statements. There is no logic that could explain the statements—not even to the community itself. Theology is reduced to “parroting” traditional statements: “I wanted to raise the question whether this procedure and this conviction didn’t mean that the theologian could do no more than repeat without conceptually redescribing the words of doctrines or scriptural statements that had doctrinal overtones and aftereffects.”33Frei’s fear is not that explanations come to an end, but rather that Phillips’s radically Wittgensteinian position means that explanations never~<br>

Abstract: Stanley Fish (
            1996) has written about the philosophical dimensions of this conflict, implying that there is no common ground that could form the basis for either agreement or even shared discussion about that disagreement. “To put the matter baldly,” he writes, “a person of religious conviction should not want to enter the marketplace of ideas but to shut it down, at least insofar as it presumes to determine matters that he believes have been determined by God and faith. The religious person should not seek an accommodation with liberalism,” he continues, “he should seek to rout it from the field, to extirpate it, root and branch” (21).<br>

Abstract: The Christian tradition supports such a view by qualifying human agency or freedom with humanity's primordial fallibility and, hence, ultimate dependence on sources of meaning larger than itself. For Ricoeur this means that love for others is not just an autonomous act (as in the classic Enlightenment ethics of Immanuel Kant) but also the placing of ultimate faith in an already given goodness of creation. As he puts it, moral agency takes place within the context of an “economy of the gift” in which the reception of a sense of one’s own “given” human goodness makes it possible in turn to imagine resisting one’s own participation in evil and “giving” a more superabundant love to others.
         42Or, as Kearney has similarly put it, moral life should involve neither pure agency nor pure prostration before the other—each of which he calls a form of “idolatry”—but rather a constantly self‐transforming “practical wisdom” that seeks through love of others ever broader “interlacings of alterities.”43If the Christian tradition has sometimes moved too far away from agency by emphasizing self‐sacrifice, a hermeneutical perspective reminds us instead that love is ultimately interactive, mutual, responsive, and productive of new social relations.<br>

Abstract: What unmistakably sets Patočka’s discourse apart from the traditional discourses on Europe—particularly those of Husserl and Heidegger—is what Derrida calls Patočka’s “essential Christianity” (
      GD,p. 22). Undoubtedly, Derrida makes this point first of all in order to distinguish Patočka’s interpretation of the theme of the care of the soul from Heidegger’s analysis of care (Sorge) inBeing and Timeas a fundamental existential structure ofDasein.Heidegger constantly sought to separate his thought from Christianity, while at the same time ontologically recovering—and de‐Christianizing—Christian themes and texts by inquiring into their originary possibility. Patočka, on the other hand, “makes an inverse yet symmetrical gesture.… He reontologizes the historic themes of Christianity and attributes to revelation or to themysterium tremendumthe ontological content that Heidegger attempts to remove from it” (GD,p. 23). But this reference to an essential Christianity also acknowledges that the emergence of responsibility in the face of everydayness and the sacred is, for Patočka, intimately connected to the history of religion. Patočka is intent on overcoming both the inauthenticity of everydayness and the demonic and the orgiastic that are an escape from it.Plato and Europeestablishes Plato as the Greek philosopher who brought the motif of the care of the soul into being and also as the thinker who transformed myth into religion, the one who “recommends … faith.” All differences considered, “faith, as the Greek philosophers saw it, is the foundation of what we call faith in the Christian tradition”; nevertheless, only Christianity is religion in an eminent sense.10Indeed, as Derrida remarks, Patočka’s thought is remarkably consistent in taking
            
      into account the event of Christian mystery as an absolute singularity, a religion par excellence and an irreducible condition for a joint history of the subject, responsibility, and Europe. That is so even if,~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: As conveniently categorized by Ricoeur in his comparisons of pagan and Jewish creation myths, three aspects of Genesis are central to P’s monotheistic challenge to his pagan neighbors: Adam’s ancestral role as the first human, his defection from God by eating the forbidden fruit, and the subordination of Eve and the serpent to Adam’s story.
         45Together these elements of the Genesis story distinguish it as an anthropomorphic myth that is motivated, Ricoeur argues, by the need to give meaning to the universal human experience of evil while simultaneously upholding Israel’s faith in an ethical or good God whose creation is good (not tragic, like that of the Greeks) and good ipso facto (not ordered from chaos, like that of the Babylonians).46The narrative does not fully cooperate with P’s argument for the absolute priority of good over evil, however. Both the snake, who appears with the offer of evil, and Eve, who responds to it, imply the existence of evil in creation and prior to human act. Thus, biblical scholarship has postulated that Eve and the snake are marginal figures in Adam’s story, even residuals of pagan mythology. While the snake as a demon and Eve, its instrument, express the possibility of evil, they are not necessary to the story, merely adding “enigmatic depth” to the Israelite narrative of Adam’s transgression.47Thus interpreted, these same three features of the Genesis account frame the traditional Christian doctrines of creation ex nihilo and original sin. Smith’s narrative begins by enlarging the frame and, in doing so, makes ideological space for human participation in the divine nature.<br>

Abstract: Although these two schools did not originally differ greatly with respect to doctrinal content, sharing as they did a common body of brahmanical religious teaching, they did differ in terms of their respective methods. This difference in method is clearly indicated by the respective senses of the terms
         sāṃ
            khyaandvedāntabefore these terms came to designate philosophical schools. In its early usage in the epic literature,sāṃ
            khyaprobably did not refer to a particular philosophical system but referred more generically to the intellectual method of salvation.28Edgerton interprets this original sense ofsāṃ
            khyaas “(the method of salvation) based on reckoning or calculation.”29In a similar way, the termvedānta, before it came to designate a particular set of doctrines, referred to the interpretive‐exegetical study of the Upaniṣadic corpus.30This early sense ofvedāntastill remains close to its literal reference to a body of texts situated “at the end of the Veda.” Thus, from its earliest beginnings, the Vedāntic school was defined by its fidelity to the Upaniṣadic texts.31Significantly, early texts such as Kauṭilīya’sArthaśāstraappear not to have recognized Vedānta and its closely allied sister school, the Pūrva‐mīmāṃsā, as schools of philosophy (ānvīkṣikī), viewing them instead—and not unjustly—as schools of Vedic exegesis.32While acknowledging the risks involved in using Western categories in the interpretation of Indian culture, we might capture the difference between Sāṃkhya and Vedānta by characterizing the former as primarily a system of philosophy and the latter as one of theology.33Of course this difference in the respective attitudes of these two schools toward “faith” and “reason” was a matter of emphasis. Vedānta, for its part, recognized the validity, albeit restricted and subordinate, of the use of reason (yukti) in deciding matters of interpretation and doctrine.34For its part, Sāṃkhya also acknowledged ~<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Abstract: Regarding the morality of soldiering, Augustine interprets the love command to apply to the internal dispositions of public officers who are commissioned to defend the common good. Love works to constrain: public officers are not to act out of vengeance or a lust for cruelty, but they are otherwise authorized to use force on behalf of the good of political life. Attention to the duties of public office, individual interiority, and the needs of the commonweal mediate Augustine’s understanding of biblical teaching. This is especially true regarding Jesus’s command to “resist not evil”—a command that would appear to prohibit all uses of violence. That account of the love command, Augustine writes, pertains not to “a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart.”
         31The concepts of public responsibility, dispositional morality, and the common good structure Augustine’s account of social responsibility and provide the framework for his interpretation of Jesus’s command. That structure provides rational concepts according to which Augustine translates the teachings of Christian faith into the ethics of killing in private and public life.32<br>

         70The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:
               While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish drea~<br>

Abstract: Dupré's final verdict on the Enlightenment is one of qualified support. While he praises the movement's goals of toleration and autonomy, he does not fail to recognize the costs of pursuing them (Dupré, 334–39). On this point his account takes a dialectical turn. As he observes in the opening pages of his study, the Enlightenment successfully “raised consciousness to the universality of reason,” but only by instituting “culture” as “alienation from one's natural self.” The result of this “estrangement,” he adds, has been the bifurcation of reason and faith: either the mind rejects all that appears foreign to it, or else it attempts to return to the security of an otherworldly sphere. Neither of these choices is sufficient, so that modern culture deepens a void in which personal identity is forever threatened with dissolution (Dupré, 12–13).<br>

Abstract: The exhortation to trust must be meant to sooth the ritual actors in case of fleeting doubt as to the mission’s purpose or success. Any obstacle is a test that raises the level of martyrdom.9. You should consider how—if you fall into temptation—you will be able to resist, remain steadfast and recover. You know that whatever happens to you would never detract from [your spiritual level] and whatever would detract from you would never happen to you. This is nothing but God’s test in order to raise the level [of your martyrdom] and to expiate your sins. You can be certain there are only minutes left until the merit will be clear—with God’s permission—of that great reward from God. The Most High said: “Or did you suppose that you will enter Paradise, before God has known who were those of you who have struggled, and those who were steadfast” [3:142].
               69The test of faith and consolation for failure are supported by events during the aforementioned Battle of Uhud, where failure presented an opportunity for expiation:
                  In other words, occasional loss is a spiritual aid and an opportunity to get closer to God.Then He put you to flight before them in order to try you. But now He has forgiven you, for surely God is kind to the faithful. Remember as you were rushing up (the hill) without turning back to look, though the Prophet was calling you from the rear, He requited you with anguish for an anguish that you do not fret for missed opportunity and what befell you, for God is aware of all that you do. (3:152–53)<br>

Abstract: Now, one might ask whether
      confessiois up to its task of being the mouthpiece through which time and narrative—the story of sin, creation, and memory—are voiced. If supporting or clarifying elements such as familiar dividing lines between events and ideas or, for that matter, authorial, religious, or philosophical frames outside that life performance have gone, are we not left with an indivisible moment that, not unlike theesse solum, cannot be told in discursive terms? And what about the possibly seductive nature of this Jaussian, a-causal way of telling a story? Would its sonority not rather sound like Anton Webern'sFünf Stücke für Orchester? And could so fragmented a performance be seductive at all? Yes, it could. Let me just give one example of how the Augustinianconfessio laudis, peccati et fideicould sound without the romanticism of a supportive narrative, melodic frame, and superimposed contents (such as faith or praise or sin that are, first, separated from and, next, projected back onto the performativeconfessioitself).<br>

Abstract: Astonishingly, Gregory E. Ganssle treats the film as a seamless whole, as though the segment involving sex, drugs, guns, car chases, and alligators were merely an extension of the part about loneliness and writer's block. For Ganssle, the fact that Susan becomes a drug addict and porn star is sufficiently explained by her yearning to share the passion of an orchid hunter: “it is no surprise,” he writes, “that she returns to Laroche and enters the world of drugs and pornography” (Gregory E.

Abstract: In 1590 and 1591, Gifford wrote two pamphlets arguing against schism and preached from the established pulpit of St. Paul's Cross; he published his longest work on magic,
         A Dialogue Concerning Witches and Witchcraftes, in 1593. InAn Exposition of the Symbole or Creed of the Apostles(London, 1595), William Perkins invoked the Thirty-Nine Articles—or, as he called it, “the Booke of the articles of faith agreed upon in open Parliament”—as expressing what he called the “true faith” (501). For the scope of Gifford's pamphleteering, see Alan MacFarlane, “A Tudor Anthropologist: George Gifford'sDiscourseandDialogue,” inThe Damned Art: Essays in the Literature of Witchcraft, ed. Sydney Anglo (New York: Routledge, 1977), 140–55; and Christopher Haigh, “The Taming of the Reformation: Preachers, Pastors, and Parishioners in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England,”History85 (2000): 572–88.

Abstract: The cultural and social sciences are welcome to examine and critique theology and Christian practice, and theology can profitably learn from these studies, but the studies themselves are not theology. To be theology, even in an interdisciplinary sense, the work must become constructive and speak to the
   religiousthought and practice of specific communities or faith traditions. In any given community, theology can become a displaced language in need of renewal, but theology can also uncover the displaced or implicit religion within the seemingly secular. To do this well, theology must remain in critical tension with the cultural sciences, including literature. The result may well be deconstructive, but such radical critique is necessary for any living tradition.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D.<br>
Abstract: The value of Popkin's approach becomes clear in his chapter on two historians whose autobiographies have been included in the literary canon for many years: Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams. By reading them as historians, Popkin offers new insights to an already great body of literature on these authors, for instance by showing that both Gibbon and Adams believed that their personal experiences helped them in understanding the past. Not all 327 autobiographers listed in the bibliography are discussed in depth, and in chapters on vocation and career their works serve to sketch an impression of the historical profession in the twentieth century. Bookish children from middle‐class backgrounds, as most historians have been, often picked up their vocation from parents or teachers. They were also often inspired by children's books like those by Jules Verne and Karl May, which is interesting, because despite these literary models they chose to write nonfiction. For Popkin this is a telling detail, as he concludes that historians are obviously motivated by a wish to tell stories. With few exceptions historians are reluctant to write about their careers. Most are silent about their academic successes, failures, and frustrations, and few pages are spent on the daily life of teaching courses and doing administrative work. On the contrary, most authors want to show that they had another life besides their profession. Therefore they often describe their own lives against the background of great events. Since Jean‐Jacques Rousseau's
      Confessions, autobiography has been seen as a genre that should focus on the innermost experience and not world events, but many historians simply could not cast off their professional background. Often only those historians who were involved in politics became aware of how little an individual could accomplish, or lost faith in the ideas they once had believed. Holocaust memoirs are discussed in a separate chapter, in which Popkin concludes that t~<br>

Abstract: Both

They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Selby Gary S.<br>
Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Article Title: The Case for Jury Sentencing<br>
Publisher: Duke University School of Law<br>
Issue: i259905<br>
Date: 3 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Coons Morris B.<br>
Abstract: There are powerful historical, constitutional, empirical, and policy justifications for a return to the practice of having juries, not judges, impose sentences in criminal cases. The fact that Americans inherited from the English a mild preference for judge sentencing was more a historical accident than a case of thoughtful policy. Jury sentencing became quite widespread in the colonial and postcolonial eras as a reflection of deep-seated mistrust of the judiciary. The gradual drift away from jury sentencing was driven not by a new-found faith in the judiciary, but rather by the now discredited paradigm of rehabilitationism. Now that that paradigm has shifted to neoretribution, and that the essential moral character of the criminal law has been rediscovered, jurors should likewise be rediscovered as the best arbiters of that moral inquiry. A return to jury sentencing would also mesh nicely with the Court's struggle in its Apprendi line of cases to find a sensible way to distinguish between elements and sentence-enhancers under the Sixth Amendment. A Sixth Amendment interpreted to include the right to jury sentencing would also restore the textual symmetry between the Sixth and Seventh Amendments. There are no constitutional, empirical, or policy reasons why a defendant accused of committing negligence has the right to have both his guilt and damages assessed by a jury, but a criminal defendant has only half that right.<br>

Author(s): Stevenson Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Issue: i23020023<br>

Author(s): Cisneros Ariane Hentsch<br>
Abstract: In today's globalized world, we need to communicate values clearly and constructively across cultures and religions to avoid misunderstanding and conflict and to find shared solutions to the issues affecting human communities across the world. This communication is not easy to implement and requires a considerable amount of commitment and empathy. To be effective, intercultural and interreligious dialogues on ethics demand, first of all, an accommodation of different epistemologies coupled with a sincere respect for their richness and internal coherence. Furthermore, our values are so closely rooted in our identity that expressing them becomes a cultural act—even an act of faith in the case of interreligious dialogue. In this paper, I argue that we need to reiterate or embrace this act of faith in the other's values if we are to properly understand them. How is this possible? The answer calls for a theoretical discussion of the hermeneutics of interreligious dialogue. When applied to intercultural and interreligious dialogues, I contend that the theory of hermeneutics needs a specific epistemological dimension—namely that of "appropriation"—that entails that we borrow the other's epistemological outlook, adopt the other's ad hoc modes of communication or transmission of values, and integrate the other's values into the constellation of our sources of meaning.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: The present article considers the relationship between the understanding of the Word of God on the part of the Church and on the part of the individual theologian. The importance of written communication for this relationship is presented and analysed. The concept of body (corpus) is applied analogically to the Church and to texts of the Tradition. The author suggests that fruitful incorporation of theological texts into the corpus of the living texts of Christian faith actualizes and symbolises the integration of individual theological understanding with that of the Church. L'articolo considera la relazione della Chiesa da una parte e del teologo individuale da un'altra alla comprensione della Parola di Dio. Analizza l'importanza, per questo rapporto, della comunicazione scritta del lavoro teologico. Il concetto di corpo si applica analogicamente tanto alla Chiesa quanto ai testi scritti della Tradizione. L'incorporazione feconda del testo teologico nel corpus dei testi viventi della fede cristiana attualizza e simboleggia l'integrazione della comprensione del teologo individuale con quella della Chiesa.<br>

Abstract: The relationship between gift and exchange continues to be a controversial issue in the missiological, anthropological and philosophical debate. The author's pastoral experience and phenomenological observation are placed within the framework of such discourses and related to the basic rationale of Luther's Reformation: The gratuity of faith interrupts both the logic and the practice of reciprocity. This thought throws some light on the networking of the churches in terms of development aid as well as on the field of intercultural missionary communication. In conclusion, the author discusses options for churches to be advocates for a culture of giving. He argues that in cultural settings shaped by a logic and practice of reciprocity Christian witness to the pure gratuity of faith is not rendered irrelevant or ineffective but rather proves itself.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author presents an analogy between the representation (...) of Jesus mentioned in the words of institution of the Eucharist and the hermeneutic concept of the gospels. Based on a "hermeneutics of representation," the former can be described as sacramental representation, the latter as narrative representation of Jesus. This is exemplified by selected passages from the gospels which reveal this concept of representation. A hermeneutical approach of this kind can at least help to overcome the distinction between the "historical Jesus" and the "Christ of faith."<br>

Abstract: In contrast to relying on something (on natural or social processes and on what others are expected to do), trust implies to believe more or less deeply in the other himself — in view of his genuine otherness which escapes our knowledge and calculation of risks. Having faith in others exposes us to severe disappointment in the case that they do not justify our belief, that is, our deep trust (which is faith). This essay examines trust in an historical perspective as a specific dimension of human vulnerability — in contrast to "systemic" trust.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>

Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: Theology can only prove its inner cohesion and unity in the interplay between life and thought in faith and in dialogue with its contemporary culture. Ch. Theobald is a theologian who does not search for this inner unity in a foundation of theological thought unfolding in various tractates but in a style of doing theology that has its analogy in being Christian. This article traces some of the elements in Theobald's style of theology.<br>

Abstract: Faith is characterized by an unsolvable problem of justification. While St. Paul concludes the truth of the faith from the practice (cf. 1. Thess 2,13), the Evangelists quote Jesus Christ as important witness (cf. Mk 1,1–3), who bears witness to himself in a decisive moment (cf. Joh 8,12–20). Who legitimates the omniscient narrator of these christological confessions? By means of Genette's narrative theory and the hermeneutic theories of Bultmann and Fuchs, the specific demand which faith puts onto the human being, becomes apparent: the auctorial narrative form frees the fundamental narrations of faith from any kind of human justification, thus marking the special credibility which is inherent to listening to God's words.<br>

Abstract: Les années soixante sont pour le protestantisme des années d'effervescence. Deux textes-témoins sont ici analysés, dans leur genèse, leur argumentation et leur réception, comme des marqueurs de ces évolutions. De l'un à l'autre l'accent se déplace: la préoccupation de la structuration ecclésiologique fait place au défi herméneutique, la question du langage de la foi devient centrale, non sans une même dimension d'utopie. The 1960s were years of effervescence for Protestantism. Two key texts are here analysed in their origins, their arguments, their receptions, as markers of this evolution. The emphasis changes from one to the other: a preoccupation with ecclesiastical structures gives way to the hermeneutical challenge, the question of the language of faith becomes central, although retaining a similar utopian dimension. In den 60-er Jahren wird der Protestantismus sehr aufgewühlt. Zwei entscheidende Texte, Wendepunkte dieser Entwicklungen, werden hier in ihrer Entstehung, ihren Argumentationsfiguren und ihrer Rezeption analysiert. Von der ekklesiologischen und strukturellen Fragestellung verschieben sich die Akzente im zweiten Bericht hin zur hermeneutischen Herausforderung, wo die Frage nach der Glaubenssprache eine zentrale Stellung einnimmt, nicht ohne eine utopische Dimension.<br>

Abstract: La Modernidad parecía condenar a la expulsión de la religión respecto del proyecto ilustrado al considerar que fe y razón eran excluyentes. No obstante, esa promesa de futuro de emancipación y de racionalidad ilustrada ha incurrido en sus propios aspectos negativos, hasta llegar, en la postmodernidad, a la deconstrucción de todo y la pérdida de sentido. El filósofo Habermas y el teólogo Ratzinger, después Papa Benedicto XVI, debatieron el papel que razón y fe debían desempeñar en las actuales sociedades plurales. Ambos partían de premisas distintas –Habermas desde la confianza en la Ilustración y en la religión como humanismo y Ratzinger desde el necesario entendimiento entre fe y razón– para llegar a un punto de encuentro: la necesidad de defender una nueva Ilustración, compatible con la religión, para operar en la postmodernidad. Modernity seemed to replace religion with the Enlightenment project, since it considered that reason and faith were mutually exclusive. However, the promise of a future of emancipation and Enlightenment reason has finally culminated, in Postmodernity, in the destruction of everything and the loss of meaning. Habermas, philosopher, and Ratzinger, theologian and later Pope Benedict XVI, discussed the role that ought to be played by reason and faith in the current plural societies. They were based on different premises—Habermas on trust in the Enlightenment and in religion from a humanistic perspective and Ratzinger on the necessary understanding between faith and reason—and reached a common point: the need to defend a new Enlightenment, compatible with religion, which can operate in Postmodernity.<br>

Abstract: El texto busca mostrar cómo Pío IX y su más conocido documento, el Syllabus errorum, publicado en 1864, participan del fin de una era multisecular en la historia del catolicismo, caracterizada por la existencia de un dominio temporal pontificio, por un vínculo afectivo de la Iglesia católica con la monarquía como forma de gobierno y por la concepción de la fe católica como única vía para la salvación. Fin de una era, no solo desde la perspectiva de la vigencia de las instituciones, sino de las representaciones que las acompañan. La demostración se apoya en un análisis de los tiempos en que el pontífice y su documento se enmarcan, desde la perspectiva braudeliana de los tiempos históricos, así como en las categorías propuestas por R. Koselleck para el estudio de la experiencia del tiempo. This article aims to show how Pius X and his most famous document, the Syllabus of Errors, published in 1864, participated in the end of a centuries-old era in the history of Catholicism that was characterized by the existence of the temporal dominion of the Popes, close ties between the Catholic Church and monarchism as a form of government and the conception of the Catholic faith as the only road to salvation. This was the end of an era, not just from the perspective of the power of institutions, but also in terms of the representations that accompanied them. The article is supported by a Braudelian analysis of the times in which the Pope and his document belonged and makes use of the categories proposed by R. Koselleck for the study of the experience of time.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24659567<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): WARE OWEN<br>
Abstract: One of the central questions of Jacques Derrida's later writings concerns the sources of religion. At times he gives explicit priority to the universal dimension of religion. In other places, however, he considers the primacy of faith in its concrete, historical context. This paper will clarify Derrida's relationship to universality and historicity by first comparing his notion of "messianicity without messianism" to that of Walter Benjamin's "weak Messianism." After drawing out these differences, I will focus on Derrida's later writings. I will show that much of the ambiguity of Derrida's thinking on religion can be resolved by turning to his work on khōra, the Greek word for "space" or "matter." The rhetoric of khōra can allow us to think through a twofold logic, one that includes the universal/historical distinction and exceeds its alternatives.<br>

ture given on the occasion of his retirement from his post as Professor of Cal-
vinistic Philosophy at the Technical University in Delft, 25th Sept. 1974, Delft
University Press, pp. 14f (reproduced freely here). To avoid misunderstanding let
me say that what is proposed here does not imply that philosophy is merely a
matter of choices made on the basis of faith. Cf. also Van Riessen: 'This, of course,
does not make philosophizing an activity of faith. It is still qualified by the scientific
peculiarity of striving to put into words that which is seen of the transcendent at
the boundary line', (p. 14).<br>

Abstract: Cf. R. Stupperich, 'Spiritualismus', Evangellsches Kirchenlexikon (Göttingen: Vanden-

Brunner, according to D. H. Th. Vollenhoven's historiographie analysis, could be a (Neo-
orthodox) variant of this confessional tradition, since Brunner privileges the apostles'
'interior word of faith' response to Christ above any 'mere words about' Christ (viz.
Scripture), and Brunner conceives of the human subjective reception of the testimonium
spiritus sancti as the validation (rather than a confirmation) of Scripture's God-Word
nature. Cf. Mike Goheen, Institute for Christian Studies 1989 Interdisciplinary paper,

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708906<br>
Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Geertsema Hendrik<br>
Abstract: Putnam's own position represents another attempt at overcoming the dilemma of
objectivism and relativism. See, for example, Reason, pp. ixff. He criticizes both metaphysical
realism and cultural relativism. He, too, fails, however, to overcome it because in his critique
of the one standpoint he is forced to argue from the standpoint of the other, and conversely.
It is tempting to compare the debate that is presently taking place in philosophy with the
struggle that has been going on for a long time in the Christian religion. The same fate that
befell faith in Scripture, when this canon of the Christian religion was understood in the
context of history, now also befalls the trust in reason, as the ultimate authority of humanism.
In both instances one sees fundamentalism pitted against relativism.<br>

Issue: i24708906<br>
Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: Indeed, Dooyeweerd in some contexts seems to suggest this, which would conflict
fundamentally with the implications of his belief in the resurrection of the body. Reporting
on a conversation with Dooyeweerd in Amsterdam in June, 1964, Steen says that he asked
Dooyeweerd "whether he thought that the fact that Paul speaks of faith abiding in I Cor. 13
after the judgment day, had any bearing on whether the function of faith would abide after
judgment. Dooyeweerd gave an interesting reply. First he said, 'faith turns into sight and
therefore faith passes away.' When I mentioned the fact that Paul emphasizes that faith
abides, he stressed the fact that we really know nothing about the future after the judgment.
When I then asked how it would be possible to conceive of a resurrected man without all the
functions and the law spheres holding, he seemed to reconsider his previous statement and
agree that I was laying my finger on an important point." (Steen, Structure, p. 85)<br>

Abstract: Other thinkers have also been instrumental in re-inteφreting philosophy as a way of re-
storing contact. I am thinking of Spren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas,
Paul Ricoeur, Charles Taylor and Alasdair Maclntyre - Spren Kierkegaard (1844, 1845, 1848)
with his analysis of human freedom as entangled in itself and liberated by the 'jump' into faith;
Heidegger (1927) with his analysis of anxiety as openness for the possibility of one's (own) im-
possibility; Levinas (1974) with his notion of the Other as a disquieting openness or wound in
my existence, Ricoeur (1990) with his four-fold analysis of the self as a relatedness to oneself
opened-up by the presence of the other, Taylor (1989) with his notion of disengaged reason
and of the intrinsic relation of persons to (their) 'goods', Maclntyre (1981) with his concept of
'goods' internai to practices.<br>

Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Dooyeweerd remained faithful to Abraham Kuyper (1898/1943, 20) here, specifically to
the well-known, almost infamous passage from the Lectures on Calvinism·.
"Hence the first claim demands that such a life system shall find its starting-point in a
special interpretation of our relation to God. This is not accidental, but imperative. If such
an action is to put its stamp upon our entire life, it must start from that point in our
consciousness in which our life is still undivided and lies comprehended in its unity, — not
in the spreading vines but in the root from which the vines spring. This point, of course, lies
in the antithesis between all that is finite in our human life and the infinite that lies beyond
it. Here alone we find the common source from which the different streams of our human
life spring and separate themselves. Personally it is our repeated experience that in the
depths of our hearts, at the point where we disclose ourselves to the Eternal One, all the
rays of our life converge as in one focus, and there alone regain that harmony which we so
often and so painfully lose in the stress of daily duty."
Wiskerke (1978, 75ff.) called this semi-mystical view 'the heart condition' of the philosophy of
the cosmonomic idea (see also the interesting notes on pp. 259ff). Kuyper's statement in the
Stone Lectures is in part based on his interpretation of Ecclesiastes 3:11 ('[God] has put
eternity into man's mind'):
"That age is the world of the Eternal, from which time, and with time all the finite, was
born.... The age that lets you leap over the boundaries of the finite and envelops you in the
ocean of the heavenly and Divine... that awakens your faith as a wholly other, wholly
independent faculty of thought and reveals you to yourself as a wholly other, far richer and
brilliant being than the world ever allowed you to see in its mirror." (De Héraut 1781, 18-2-
1912; cited in Dutch by Wiskerke 1978, 79).
Wiskerke suggests that this semi-mysticism evinces some~<br>

Abstract: François Laplanche a été un éminent spécialiste de l'histoire de l'exégèse catholique. S'il a consacré ses dernières années à Loisy, notamment par l'édition de son grand manuscrit sur La crise de la foi dans le temps présent, c'est d'abord à la figure de Lamennais qu'il s'est longuement intéressé. C'est ce qu'explique cet article qui cherche à identifier le sens et les raisons de la quête par F. L. de la science catholique. Ce concept, mis en circulation dans les milieux mennaisiens, occupe une place centrale par sa volonté d'inclure tous les savoirs, y compris les plus nouveaux, dans une succession de révélations dont le catholicisme serait l'aboutissement. Cette manière de penser théologiquement l'histoire a pu faire un temps sa place à une science des religions, perçue comme la quête des traces de la révélation primitive; elle s'est vite révélée incapable de prendre en compte les exigences d'une approche scientifique des écritures et de ce fait elle a joué un rôle non négligeable dans le long hiver de l'exégèse catholique. François Laplanche was an eminent scholar of the history of Catholic exegesis. He spent his last years studying Loisy, notably via the edition of his large manuscript on The Contemporary Faith Crisis, but his first concern was the figure of Lamennais. This article tries to identify the meaning and the reasons of François Laplanche's quest of Catholic science. This concept, which circulates in mennaisian circles, occupies a central place because of his willingness to include all forms of knowledge, including the newest ones, in a succession of revelations of which Catholicism would be culmination. This way of theologically thinking history gave way for a time to a science of religions, seen as the quest of the traces of primitive revelation; it soon proved unable to take into account the requirements of a scientific approach of the scriptures and thus it has played a significant role in the long winter of Catholic exegesis.

Author(s): Masondo Sibusiso<br>
Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses human resources management (HRM) systems and practices in a large multinational management consultancy firm. The firm invests considerable resources in HRM, and is frequently praised by employees for its accomplishments in hiring, developing, and promotion. However, this general faith in HRM does not align particularly well with employees' experiences and perceptions of the specific HRM practices in the firm. The paper critically interprets the meaning and the functions of the HRM system and the beliefs supporting it. The paper suggests a reinterpretation of HRM systems and practices based on a cultural-symbolic perspective. It introduces the concepts of excess ceremonialism, identity projects, and aspirational control to highlight and interpret the significance of organizational symbolism in accounting for the role of HRM systems and practices, and the various effects of HRM systems and practices on employee identity and compliance.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyse some questions proposed by the debate on the issue of modernity and post-modernity in the context of the philosophy of Leonardo Coimbra, from the reflection on these issues made by Jürgen Habermas in the work
         The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity. Thus, the critique to modern reason, the reflection on the metaphysics, the issues about the relationship between reason and faith, the religious phenomenon, the process of secularization, are our starting point for the questioning and the philosophical understanding that postmodernity makes of these problems The inauguration of this new rationality allows a new questioning about the reason and the world, manifesting the sublime character of its nature, allowing a new reflection, a critique of self-sufficient and self-reflexive reason and recovering another discursive and cooperative form of reason.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>
Issue: i29777260<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Author(s): White Sheldon H.<br>
Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Issue: i40000340<br>

Author(s): Pinnock Sarah K.<br>
Abstract: Christian Holocaust scholars insist that historical atrocity should catalyze religious change. Many established Holocaust theologians presume that the antidote to anti-Judaism involves identifying an authentic version of Christian faith lacking moral blemish. However, recent responses tend to view the Bible and the Christian tradition as irreducibly ambiguous. These new responses foreground perpetrator perspectives and correlate developments in theological reflection with evolving public Holocaust representations. They are distinctive in advocating careful examination of biographical connections to the Holocaust, including family, religious, and national identification. In significant ways, emphasis on ambiguity in recent Christian Holocaust thought provides critical leverage on the redemptive tendencies of popular Holocaust remembrance in the United States.<br>

Article Title: Before the Original Position: The Neo-Orthodox Theology of the Young John Rawls<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000755<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Gregory Eric<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a remarkable document that has escaped critical attention within the vast literature on John Rawls, religion, and liberalism: Rawls's undergraduate thesis, "A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith: An Interpretation Based on the Concept of Community" (1942). The thesis shows the extent to which a once regnant version of Protestant theology has retreated into seminaries and divinity schools where it now also meets resistance. Ironically, the young Rawls rejected social contract liberalism for reasons that anticipate many of the claims later made against him by secular and religious critics. The thesis and Rawls's late unpublished remarks on religion and World War II offer a new dimension to his intellectual biography. They show the significance of his humanist response to the moral impossibility of political theology. Moreover, they also reveal a kind of Rawlsian piety marginalized by contemporary debates over religion and liberalism.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000789<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Author(s): Farley Margaret A.<br>
Abstract: One way into the question of the relation of ethics and liturgy is to focus on a critical issue facing liturgy today: its impoverishment and inability to nurture Christian faith and life. Three aspects of this problem are: injustice within the worshipping community, disagreement regarding forms of Christian service to the world, and the breakdown of symbols. Ethics must move beyond the articulation of formal principles and assertions regarding the importance of liturgy for the moral agent if it is to fulfill its task vis-à-vis these problems.<br>

Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: O tema principal deste artigo incide na relação entre a metafísica de Deus e a abordagem de Deus na filosofia da religião. Três modelos são apresentados, respectivamente sob os títulos seguintes: 1) o caminho da filosofia para a fé; 2) a filosofia e a fé no mesmo caminho; 3) o caminho da fé para a filosofia. Os modelos apoiam-se sobre: 1) Tomás de Aquino, na primeira parte; 2) Hegel, na segunda e 3) a hermenêutica contemporânea, na terceira. Não se trata de repetir esses autores, mas de tentar decifrar o momento especulativo próprio de cada um no que diz respeito à articulação do Deus da metafísica com o Deus da fé. /// Le thème principal de cet article concerne la relation entre la métaphysique de Dieu et l'approche de Dieu en philosophie de la religion. Trois modèles sont proposés, respectivement: 1) le chemin de la philosophie vers la foi; 2) la philosophie et la foi sur le même chemin; 3) le chemin de la foi vers la philosophie. Ces modèles s'appuient sur les auteurs ou courants philosophiques suivants: Thomas d'Aquin dans la première partie; Hegel, dans la seconde; l'herméneutique contemporaine dans la troisième. Il ne s'agit pas de répéter ces auteurs, mais de dégager le moment spéculatif de chacun quant à l'articulation du Dieu de la métaphysique avec le Dieu de la foi. /// The principal them of this article has to do with the religion that can be established between the God of metaphysics and that which can be discerned in the philosophy of religion. Three models are presented: 1) the path from philosophy to faith; 2) philosophy and faith on this very path; 3) the path from fait to philosophy. These three models are based respectively on the following: 1) Thomas Aquinas; 2) Hegel; and 3) contemporary hermeneutics. It is not a matter of repeating these others, but rather to capture the speculative moment that can be found in each and that contribute to the articulation of he God of metaphysics with the God of faith.<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Article Title: El Psicoanálisis de Freud en la Filosofía Hermenéutica de Paul Ricoeur<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics. To begin with, Ricoeurs initial contact with the problematic of psychoanalysis in La symbolique du mal will be treated.

Author(s): Nauta Rein<br>
Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40014917<br>
Date: 3 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Hart Curtis W.<br>
Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: L'expansion de l'agnosticisme et de l'athéisme semble devoir faire de la société occidentale une société sans religion. Mais la religion n'est pas forcément liée à une métaphysique ni à unefoi. Le judéo-christianisme fut aussi une « mise en scène » de l'aveu du péché en vue de la Rédemption. Il pourrait se perpétuer sous sa forme purement théâtrale dans un monde sans foi ni métaphysique. The expansion of both agnosticism and atheism seems to turn the Western society into a society without religion. But religion is not necessarily linked with either a metaphysics or a faith. Judeo-Christianity was also a « staging » of the confession of Sin linked to Redemption. It might be carried on according to its purely theatrical way in a world without either faith or metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: La première partie de cet article (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) envisageait, pour le siècle nouveau, un judéo-christianisme compatible avec l'athéisme contemporain, car il consisterait en une sorte de pratique « théâtrale » qui, de la tradition, ne retiendrait pas la foi métaphysique et historique mais le couple péché/Rédemption vécu comme une sorte d'illusion positive. On essaie maintenant de déterminer le rôle qu'ont pu jouer, dans ce devenir : Kant, Bergson, Freud, le pape Jean-Paul II et certains philosophes français d'aujourd'hui (Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion). The first part of this paper (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) was studying, for this coming century, a new judeo-christianism compatible with contemporary atheism since it would consist in some kind of a theatrical practice. This new form of judeo-christianism would keep from tradition no longer the metaphysical and historical faith but the couple sin/redemption, lived as some kind of a positive illusion. One now attempts at determining what may be the part played in such a process by Kant, Bergson, Freud, Pope John Paul II and a few French philosophers of today (namely : Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion).<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>

Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>

Date: 12 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Hatch John B.<br>
Abstract: The book Letters Across the Divide: Two Friends Explore Racism, Friendship, and Faith embodies a dialogic rhetoric with significant potential to influence its intended audience to accept the need for racial atonement and reconciliation. It exemplifies what Aaron Gresson calls a "dance of agency" in both its interpersonal exchanges and constructed relationship with readers. Bringing white and black voices, individual and collective concerns, and (interpersonal and public discourse into dialogue, Letters demonstrates the transformative power of "voice," which mediates the "authenticity" of Buberian dialogic rhetoric and the cultural performances of Bakhtinian dialogism. The fact that the white coauthor boldly affirms commonplaces of white resistance increases the likelihood that white readers would identify with and be influenced by his profound attitudinal change in dialogue with his black friend. The coherence and credibility ofthat transformation depend upon the prefigurai power of the authors' shared religious narrative—both enabling and constraining Letters' influence on public racial reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Attempting a Christ-oriented reading of the Old Testament is a challenge which invites objections and obstacles. What is the degree of legitimacy or of necessity which the New Testament (the Gospels and Acts) provides for such a reading? We are concerned with those texts which set forth the principle itself rather than with individual citations; such a reading appears as inseparable from the foundations of the faith. Other texts are illuminating for us with regard to the way of carrying this out. This article presents the first lines of a response, by means of a hermeneutical conversion. It presupposes that one cannot distance oneself from the literal meaning and from its spiritual and theological content.<br>

Abstract: En suivant le mouvement circulaire que dessine l'ouvrage fondamental d'Éric Weil, la « Logique de la Philosophie », on relève d'un même coup le penser qui s'y déploie et le rôle qu'y tiennent l'idée de Dieu, la foi biblique et le christianisme. On analyse d'abord la catégorie de Dieu, introduite dans le monde par l'attitude de la foi biblique. On note ensuite ce que devient l'idée de Dieu dans les catégories ultérieures. L'examen des catégories du sens et de la sagesse, constitutives de la philosophie, permet de voir comment le logicien recueille à sa manière le sur-être indicible de la tradition philosophique occidentale, sous la forme du sens présent, de l'éternité de la présence dans le temps de l'histoire. On manifeste enfin, à travers l'écart, quelques convergences entre cette philosophie séculière et la pensée d'un croyant. In the circular movement of the main work of Eric Weil, the « Logique de la Philosophie », we may notice both the development of the thought and the part played by the idea of God, the biblical faith and Christianity. The category of God, introduced by the behaviour of biblical faith, is analysed, and also how the idea of God appears in further categories. By examining categories of meaning and wisdom, proper to philosophy, we may see what means, for the logician, the ineffable over-being of the Western philosophical tradition, as a present meaning, as an eternal presence in historical time. At last appears, through the difference, some convergence between this secular philosophy and the thought of a believer.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes some guidelines for relevant Indian interpretations of the Bible. It examines the traditional Western methods and perspectives as well as the challenges to these methods in Biblical hermeneutics in India. Shifting trends in Western methods of biblical interpretation and their inability to meet the needs of the context could give the motivation to develop methods and principles for authentic Indian biblical interpretations. Drawing on insights from the biblical interpretation in Latin America, Asia and South Africa, Indian Biblical hermeneutics must move towards discovering critical tools that are helpful in the Indian context. Such an endeavour needs to take seriously both the inner and the outer reality of India and develop a proper perspective for Indian Biblical interpretations. Judicious use of the critical tools and resources available in the context, commitment to the poor and the oppressed and faith-response to God are imperative for evolving effective Indian biblical interpretations. The complex Indian context demands a plurality of critical biblical readings with the people in pluri-religious community, open to the dynamic activity of the Spirit with a goal to transform our society and promote communal harmony.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Author(s): Johnston Erin F.<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners' narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on narrative identity and drawing on 15 months offieldwork and 25 in-depth interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative: what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally continuous and essentialized Pagan self I suggest that while all conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1) perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to legitimacy and social acceptance: and (3) understanding of the nature of religious truth.<br>

Abstract: Fondé en 1945, Réforme offre un réel pluralisme politique et il se présente plutôt comme le journal où les intellectuels protestants sont en mesure de s'exprimer. En face de la Guerre d'Algérie, il possède une ligne politique générale que l'on appelle alors « libérale », c'est-à-dire favorable à une évolution progressive, qui n'écarte pas l'idée, à long terme, d'une indépendance de l'Algérie où les Français pourraient continuer à vivre. À partir de 1958, son directeur, A. Finet, fait confiance au général de Gaulle pour résoudre le problème ; mais une partie de ses rédacteurs sont nettement plus à gauche, sans négliger, pour autant, la détresse des Français d'Algérie. The review Réforme, founded in 1945, offers a genuine variety of political views, and sees itself as the forum where Protestant intellectuals can express themselves. Confronted with the Algerian War, it adopted a general political stance then known as "liberal", that is to say, in favour of gradual evolution which would not exclude, in the long term, the idea of independence for an Algeria in which the French could continue to live. From 1958 on its director, A. Finet, put his faith in General de Gaulle as the person to solve the problem ; but some of his editorial colleagues were distinctly more left-wing, without however ignoring the distress of the Algerian French. Die 1945 gegründete Wochenzeitung Réforme (Reformation) bietet politisch einen wirklichen Pluralismus und bietet den protestantischen Intellektuellen die Möglichkeit, ihre Meinung zu äußern. Zum Algerienkrieg hat « Réforme » eine allgemeine politische Linie, die man damah « liberal » nannte, nämlich dass eine langsame Entwicklung angestrebt wurde, die auch die Unabhängigkeit Algeriens, in dem die Franzosen weiterhin leben könnten, nicht ausschloss. Der Direktor von « Réforme » , A. Finet, vertraut ab 1958 General de Gaulle, dass er eine Lösung finden könnte, während einige Redakteure des Blatts eine deutlich linke Position einnehmen, ohne ~<br>

Abstract: L'article distingue trois périodes, dans le XXe siecle théologique français: 1893-1943 où l'on est préoccupé de la crise moderniste; 1945-1965 où toutes sortes de renouveaux preparent Vatican II; de 1965 à nos jours, où se fait la réception du Concile en même temps qu'apparaissent de nouveaux défis. Après avoir ajouté aux noms des théologiens les plus connus quelques autres qui méritent attention, il decrit ce qui permet de dire qu'il n'y a pas seulement au XXe siècle des théologiens français, mais une théologie frangaise, essentiellement soucieuse du rapport entre foi et culture. This paper distinguishes three periods of French theology in the Twentieth Century: 1893-1943, when the major concern is the crisis of Modernism; 1945-1965, when a variety of reforms are preparing for Vatican II; and from 1965 till the present day, as the reception of the Council meets new challenges. After supplementing the names of the best-known theologians with some others who deserve attention, the paper proposes that in the Twentieth Century, there are not only French theologians, but in fact a French theology, that is deeply concerned with the relationship between faith and culture.<br>

Abstract: Les limites du rapport fertile entre Foi et Raison sont celles qui cernent les identités respectives de chacun des trois auteurs abordés. Témoignant de leur « air de famille » ils se rejoignent par une profonde valorisation personnelle et éclairent l'intellectualisme optimiste qui caractérise une certaine conscience occidentale. The limits of the fruitful relationship between Faith and Reason are those which define the identities of each of the three Authors concerned here. Giving testimony to their "family likeness", they share a strong self-actualisation, and shed light on the optimistic intellectualism that is typical of a certain Western consciousness.<br>

Author(s): Haers Jacques<br>
Abstract: The Jesuit Refugee Service contributes in a creative way to the mission of «faith doing justice». Its starting point is the experience of and with the refugees it is called to serve. This article, therefore, has a distinct narrative character. JRS' practice sheds light on some important aspects of justice, which can also be found in solid presentations of Catholic Social Teaching. This contribution highlights how faith, mission (accompaniment, service and advocacy) and institutional capacity are key features of a solid understanding of justice. Il Servizio dei gesuiti per i rifugiati (JRS) contribuisce in modo creativo alla missione della «fede che opera la giustizia». Il suo punto di partenza è l'esperienza dei e con i rifugiati che si è chiamati a serviré. Questo articolo, tuttavia, presenta una diversa peculiarità di discorso. L'esperienza del JRS illumina alcuni aspetti importanti della giustizia che possono anche essere ritrovati in importanti trattazioni della dottrina sociale della Chiesa. Questo contributo chiarisce come la fede, la missione (accogiienza, servizio e tutela) e la capacità di muoversi a livello istituzionale siano chiavi imprescindibili per una comprensione profonda della giustizia.<br>

Abstract: S'inspirant de travaux menés à l'Institut de recherches herméneutiques et systématiques de Neuchâtel, l'article esquisse quelques implications résultant d'une approche herméneutique du dialogue entre science et foi. Partant de l'extension du phénomène de l'interprétation, il réfléchit aux conditions du travail interdisciplinaire et à l'accent interactionnel qui en résulte. Il aborde ensuite la question d'un tiers d'ancrage pour science et foi, ce qui le conduit à une réflexion sur la dialectique entre Ecriture et expérience. Inspired by recent work at the Research institute of hermeneutics and systematics in Neuchatel, this article delineates some implications of a hermeneutical approach to the dialogue between science and faith. From the enlargment of the import of interpretation, it goes on to discuss the prerequisites of interdisciplinary work and the resultant interactional emphasis. Interaction requires a common grounding, an anchorage outside both science and faith. As experience, this leads the theologian to the challenge of the dialectic between Scripture and experience.<br>

Issue: i40182120<br>
Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Müller Denis<br>
Abstract: L'auteur esquisse la relation de l'utilitarisme et du christianisme sous l'angle triple des rapports entre le bien et le salut, le sacrifice et le sujet, la souffrance réduite ou affrontée. Le trépied ainsi proposé ne constitue pas une cage de fer, à laquelle toute comparaison et toute lecture devraient se soumettre ou se refuser, mais seulement une possible structure de dialogue et de débat, devant faciliter et fructifier l'interpellation réciproque de la morale utilitariste et de l'éthique chrétienne. The author sketches the link of utilitarianism and Christianity on three bases : the relation of goodness and faith ; of sacrifice and the individual, of suffering denied and suffering met. This three-legged stool is not an iron cage meant to be accepted or rejected by the reader, but only a possible framework for dialogue designed to allow the mutual questioning of utilitarian morals and Christian ethics.<br>

Issue: i40182162<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Ricœur Paul<br>
Abstract: L'auteur se donne pour but de montrer en quoi les philosophies existentialistes rappellent à la foi chrétienne les questions décisives auxquelles elle doit sans cesse se confronter. Il le fait en partant de thèmes concrets traités par les existentialistes de manière à interpeller la foi de manière radicale: les enjeux de la liberté, l'incarnation de l'être humain dans un corps et une histoire, et les difficultés de la communication avec autrui. Par là même l'existentialisme est à même de «nettoyerc» la foi chrétienne. The writer shows existentialist philosophies reminding the Christian faith of decisive questions it must continually ask itself. On the basis of such concrete themes treated by existentialists, he questions the faith in a radical way concerning the stakes of freedom, the incarnation of humankind in a body and in history, and the difficulties of interpersonal communication. Existentialism is thus in a position to «cleanse» the Christian faith.<br>

Abstract: La question des rapports entre éthique philosophique et éthique théologique est au cœur de la pensée de Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposant une conception originale de la raison dans ses liens à la nature et à l'histoire, l'auteur des Discours et de la Foi chrétienne restructure l'éthique philosophique autour des notions de Biens, de vertus et de devoirs. Quels liens une telle vision de l'éthique entretient-elle avec l'interprétation théologique de thèmes comme le Royaume de Dieu, la rédemption, la justification par la foi et la sanctification ? La concentration téléologique sur les Biens (Güterlehre) et sur le Bien suprême est-elle à comprendre aussi en un sens théologique ? Et si oui, comment penser la relation entre la dogmatique, la dialectique et l'éthique, non seulement chez Schleiermacher, mais dans le contexte moderne et postmoderne qui est le nôtre ? The relation between philosophical and theological ethics is at the centre of the thought of F. D. Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposing an original conception of reason in its connection to nature and to history, the author of Discourses and of The Christian Faith restructures philosophical ethics around the notions of the Good, of virtues and of duties. What connection does such a vision of ethics have with the theological interpretation of themes like the Kingdom of god, redemption, justification by faith and sanctification? Can the teleological focus on the Good fGüterlehrej andón the supreme Good be also understood theologically? If yes, how should one think of the relation between dogmatics, dialectics and ethics, not only in Schleiermacher, but in the modern and postmodern context of our age?<br>

Abstract: L'épreuve du doute est condition fondamentale du travail du théologien. Mais elle est également condition fondamentale de l'existence des croyantes et croyants. Partant de cette double hypothèse, l'article se donne pour but d'explorer la fécondité du doute, en travaillant pour ce faire sur les deux plans de la théologie et de la foi dont la théologie entreprend de rendre compte. S'inspirant de quelques modèles issus d'époques diverses de l'histoire des idées, l'auteur tente de mettre en lumière la contribution fertile du doute dans le travail théologique en tant que tâche actuelle. Putting doubt to the test is a fundamental condition of the theologian's job. But it is also a fundamental condition in the life of believers. On this double premise, the article tries to explore the fecundity of doubt both in theology and in the domain of faith, of which the task of theology is to render account. Inspired by models from diverse eras in the history of ideas, the author throws light on the fertile contribution of doubt to modern theology.<br>

Date: 2 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Yankah Hirokazu<br>
Abstract: In this article, I develop a theory of what I call the abeyance of agency, drawing upon a comparison between Fijian Christian church and gift-giving rituals. I argue that from religious practitioners' viewpoint, religious faith concerns not so much the intentions of an anthropomorphic God as the limits that are temporarily placed on ritual participants' agency. Such abeyance and subsequent recovery of their agency enables them to experience the intimations of an ultimate response. [agency, form, temporality, gift exchange, Christianity, Fiji]<br>

Article Title: Metaphor and Imagination in James Wilson's Theory of Federal Union<br>
Publisher: American Bar Foundation<br>
Issue: i234271<br>
Date: 1 1, 1948<br>
Author(s): Corner Stephen A.<br>
Abstract: American federalism is nothing more-and nothing less-than a metaphor. This was how James Wilson, the most prominent lawyer at the Philadelphia Convention, came to approach the novel problem of understanding and conveying what federalism in a modern republic should mean. The Federal Republic created in 1787 was, for Wilson, more than a matter of ingenious political design, more than a matter of the "new science of politics," and more than a matter of constitutional law or constitutionalism itself-unless the Constitution were seen to "comprehend" the moral purpose and moral promise of the new nation. To Wilson, this view of the importance of the moral content of republican federalism was entailed by the "knowledge" that he took to be the necessary foundation of the Republic. It was this knowledge of certain fundamental principles-of "moral science," human nature, and the nature of language, and, more generally, of "cultivation" as a political and social process that was also an end in itself-that ultimately justified "the People" as the "sublime" metaphor governing American constitutional theory. Yet, for all Wilson's faith in figurative "comprehensiveness," his distinctive approach to securing the New Republic through a federal union of the American People seems to have proved less and less compelling to his contemporaries the more he tried to pursue it as far as his vision of a politics of cultivation directed.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Hayes frequently uses recombination and assiduously designed constraints to link his poems to those of African American women poets who have preceded him. In
         Hip Logic, he includes as an epigraph a poem “made up of whole and partial lines in the index (underW) ofThe Collected Poems of.”audre lorde
            
               The collection also includes a sonnet entirely made up of the line “We sliced the watermelon into smiles” repeated fourteen times, and several odes. The bulk of the book is made up of a series of poems titled “A Gram of &S,” based on the daily word game found in the puzzle section of newspapers. Hayes explains in a note, “I end each line with one of the eleven words derived from the title word, while abiding by the other rules of the game: 1. Words must be derived from four or more letters. 2. Words that acquire four letters by the addition of ‘s,’ such as ‘bats’ or ‘dies’ are not used. 3. Only one form of a verb is used.”91
            
               In a more recent collection titled92
            Lighthead, Hayes also uses constraints. Reading just the end words of “The Golden Shovel” inLightheadgives the entirety of Gwendolyn Brooks's poem “We Real Cool”:
               
            When I am so small Da's sock covers my arm, we
               Cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
            
               Brooks's poem has been literally re-authored, as has Elizabeth Alexander's “Ladders,” which emerges in the end words of Hayes' poem “The Last Train to Africa”Men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.

               in precisely the same way. Homage and lineage are inscribed directly into Hayes's poems, so that the reader cannot read one without the other. This incorporation of the precursor is more thoroughgoing than an onomastic reference or dedication: it literally reproduces the precursor poem. As Hayes's new poem circulates, Brooks's ~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Nonetheless, while I think that “correlationism” is a phony rap, there is something to Meillassoux's critique of “fideism,” because there is a version of Continental theory that sees it as a way to limit science in order to create a gap that can only be filled with faith in God. The real meaning of fideism is found in the God of the gaps. In my view, Continental theory is more “realistic” than Meillassoux allows, and it is also capable of a more critical reading of religion than the Kantian version of postmodern theory allows, which I think is indeed a version of fideism.

Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: The two essays that follow situate their gaze on Shaw's cosmology. Jay Tunney's moving, evocative piece, “The Spiritual Shaw,” again affirms the profundity of Shaw's close relationship with his father, Gene. The extraordinary experience on the island of Brioni was a powerful moment in Shaw's ongoing reflection about the intersection of the physical and metaphysical, manifested (among other places) in his keenness for boxing. Witnessing Polly Tunney's painful and near-fatal appendicitis attack, Gene's faith, and the miraculous arrival of two medical saviors, Shaw was deeply affected by what Tunney describes as the “simplicity and enormity of the circumstance,” and thereafter “prayer broadened his definition of the human spirit.” With the reputed interconnection between health and hope as his starting point, Howard Ira Einsohn also explores Shaw's moral and religious philosophy in “Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur: Emissaries of Hope, Faith, and Wellness.” Einsohn's commentary traces convergences in the thinking of both figures to articulate how Shaw's tragic-optimism acts as “his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.”<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: As he expresses in his reading of
         Don Quixote, the idea of faith is central to Bloch's conception of utopia in the West. He sees a positive aspect in religion, which is faith having a goal when reality falls short of material fulfillment. Bloch sees the biblical Judeo-Christian tradition as the historical source of utopian ideation in the West, at least in its mystical, rather than dogmatic, emphasis on transformation (a view he shares with theologian Paul Tillich). For this reason, he can be sympathetic to religion—another way in which he resembles a traditional liberal humanist more than a typical Marxist would.<br>

Abstract: Ruth Levitas has suggested that “in the move beyond modernism, the Utopian method needs to be seen as provisional … dialogic … and … reflexive.”
         
               Joyce himself makes this move: his work does not engage in the theoretical absolutism of so much classical modernism—an absolute faith in the transcendental authority of theoretical ideals that so often led toward a political fundamentalism of the Left or of the Right. By contrast, Joyce's writing operates from a heteroglossic perspective that parallels Bakhtin and preempts postmodernist pluralism. Unlike Orwell or Huxley, Joyce demonstrates that a democratic literary response to absolutist Utopianism need not take the form of a cautionary dystopianism. Joyce instead offers an affirmatory and comedic set of possibilities.167<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Rowe and Koetter's book proposed a reading of twentieth-century modernist architecture and city planning that apparently revealed the fatal flaws that poisoned it from the outset. According to the authors, the peculiar admixture of blind faith in technoscience combined with a desire for a return to paradise ensured that modern architecture would be the enemy of urban life. In short, a species of technological utopianism was identified as the ultimate culprit. Overcoming the influence of utopian thinking in architecture was advanced as the only sure guarantee against repeating the failures of the modern movement and for protecting us from its tyrannical tendencies more generally.<br>

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>
