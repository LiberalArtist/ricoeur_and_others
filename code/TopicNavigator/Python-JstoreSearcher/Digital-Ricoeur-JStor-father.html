  The Forged Dublin Castle Document 1916 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt18kcvc1">Enigmas of Sacrifice</a><br>
  Abstract: The disruption of their household that the Plunkett family experienced in the years after 1916, and lasting well into the 1920s, inevitably led to some disordering of papers relating to Joseph’s politico-military activities and writings. The distribution of books and papers after his father’s death in 1948 added a further hazard to orderly preservation. It is therefore gratifying that G. N. Plunkett’s archive in the NLI should disclose a small amount of material generated by his eldest son. Mss. 12,009–10 contain two notebooks, the first labeled Philosophy and dating from 1908 to 1909, the second containing literary matter from<br>

  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Two forms of taxidermy predominate in the popular imagination: the type specimen in the natural history museum and the severed-head–style hunting trophy. In the case of the museum specimen, taxidermic animals stand in for their species; single animals serve as representatives of whole populations. In the tradition of the “Father of Modern Taxidermy” Carl Akeley, the aesthetic of the museum specimen minimizes differences between individuals (such as bullet wounds and other surface blemishes) to maximize an animal’s emblematic power; according to Donna Haraway, such taxidermy makes “nature true to type.”¹ In the case of hunting trophies, taxidermic animals represent<br>

  Abstract: The father is dead. On this point, Julia Kristeva and René Girard agree. What then can be said any longer of the paternal function? What legacy of the father persists in ongoing economies of sacrifice? And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis? May a father yet live within intimate spaces? Endeavoring to answer these questions, I turn to literature, for Girard and Kristeva agree that literature is<br>

  Abstract: I argued in chapter 2 that post-Revolutionary America experienced a backlash against too-damned-much-democracy: revolutionary impulses needed to be curtailed, so elites thought, to prevent the young nation from succumbing to what founding father Benjamin Rush diagnosed as the disease of “anarchia” and from sliding into what the Connecticut Wits portrayed in

  Abstract: There is a compelling passage in Siri Hustvedt’s essay “Yonder” that immediately brought to my mind the life and work of the painter Ian Fairweather. Hustvedt was born in America of Norwegian parents, and her childhood map of the world “consisted of two regions only: Minnesota and Norway, my here and my there.”¹ This was the “yonder” her father described as a place “between here and there,” a place that could not be occupied without it becoming “here” and thereby creating another elusive and indeterminate yonder, elsewhere.

  Abstract: In ″Hamlet in Purgatory,″ literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt challenges Freud′s privileging of Oedipus as the modern representative of psychological interiority. Greenblatt maintains that Shakespeare′s Hamlet is the one who does this work (chapter 5 in this volume). ″Remember me″ is the haunting demand of the dead father to Prince Hamlet. Following Goethe′s lead in seeing the prince as more of a neurotic than a hero, Greenblatt tests Jacques Lacan′s idea that the subject is the doing of the phantasm (1979) by actually traversing Hamlet′s ghost in history, so to speak. ″Something have you heard of Hamlet′s transformation: so I call<br>

  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Abstract: I would like to begin with the story of Anna (not her real name); her father introduced her to French at the age of two. Although he was born in Australia, he spoke fluent French and taught her French nursery rhymes and songs. Anna went on to study French at school from reception to Yr 12, and had the opportunity to visit France on several occasions with her family. To most of us, this would seem to be an ideal situation.

  Abstract: Fans of Robert Segal will find him in classic form here, working the permutations and combinations of both mythical narratives and theorists that he has applied to them. Novel here is Segal’s claim that the biblical narrative accounts of the life of King Saul conform to mythical patterns. Closely examined, that is, they show themselves exemplifying classic mythical themes such as the son’s desire to kill the father. As interpreted by two major classical theorists, psychoanalyst Otto Rank, and myth-ritualist Lord Raglan, Segal works over the biblical text to show how the perspectives of both Rank and Raglan can be<br>

Driscoll uses archetypal psychology to explore Milton's great themes of God, man, woman, and evil and offers readers deepened understanding of Jung's profound thoughts on Godhead. The Father, the Son, Satan, Messiah, Samson, Adam, and Eve gain new dimensions of meaning as their stories become epiphanies of the archetypes of Godhead.<br>

  Abstract: The Shriek of Silenceis a first in several respects: the first to examine the Holocaust novels in their original languages, the first to articulate a theoretical basis for its approach, and the first phenomenological investigation -- one that attempts to penetrate the process of creation for these novelists. Organized along conceptual lines, the book examines "the word in exile," the themes of death of the father and the child, transformations of the self, and the implications of the reader. Its philosophical foundations are Rosenzweig, Buber, Neher, and Levinas. Its critical approach is shaped by Bakhtin.<br>

  Abstract: The whole of creation history includes, among other things, human history. Perhaps the emerging field of Big History is the closest secular counterpart to the theologian’s creation history. Within the cosmic hsitory of creation, systematic theologians commonly include an anthropology—an explication of what is human—in their explication of Christian doctrine. Sometimes the anthropology appears between expositions of the First and Second Articles of the creeds—that is, between explications of God as Father and God as Son. The sorry state of the human condition explains why the good creation is in need of redemption. So theological anthropology fits<br>

  Abstract: “Just as we reject the principle of divorcing faith and works, so we reject the principle and the practice of divorcing the life of faith and the life of study,” wrote Father Leo Ward of the University of Notre Dame in 1961.¹ Describing the ideal for the Catholic school, Ward’s rejection invites reflection on Catholic intellectual life. However, this comment, which might galvanize Catholic professors who perceive themselves as exemplars of the ideal, might also solicit quite a different reaction from those outside the professionally academic arena. The public perception of Catholicism does not always incline toward a scholastic tradition.<br>

He can thus be seen in the tradition of Leo Strauss, as the father of liberalism, but also, from a liberal perspective, he is dismissed as the guardian of state absolutism. Hobbes stresses the absoluteness of state power, being the sovereign, that is highest, not surmountable power, so strong that he denies to the subjects aligned with each other in the person of the Leviathan every right to defy a sovereign decision or to<br>

  Book Title: Technologies of Life and Death: From Cloning to Capital Punishment-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Oliver Kelly<br>
  Abstract: The central aim of this book is to approach contemporary problems raised by technologies of life and death as ethical issues that call for a more nuanced approach than mainstream philosophy can provide. To do so, it draws on the recently published seminars of Jacques Derrida to analyze the extremes of birth and dying insofar as they are mediated by technologies of life and death. With an eye to reproductive technologies, it shows how a deconstructive approach can change the very terms of contemporary debates over technologies of life and death, from cloning to surrogate motherhood to capital punishment, particularly insofar as most current discussions assume some notion of a liberal individual. The ethical stakes in these debates are never far from political concerns such as enfranchisement, citizenship, oppression, racism, sexism, and the public policies that normalize them. Technologies of Life and Death thus provides pointers for rethinking dominant philosophical and popular assumptions about nature and nurture, chance and necessity, masculine and feminine, human and animal, and what it means to be a mother or a father. In part, the book seeks to disarticulate a tension between ethics and politics that runs through these issues in order to suggest a more ethical politics by turning the force of sovereign violence back against itself. In the end, it proposes that deconstructive ethics with a psychoanalytic supplement can provide a corrective for moral codes and political cliches that turn us into mere answering machines.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Descartes Otherwise: Blind, Mad, Dreamy, and Bad-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Kyoo<br>
  Abstract: Focusing on the first four images of the Other mobilized in Descartes' Meditations--namely, the blind, the mad, the dreamy, and the bad--Reading Descartes Otherwise casts light on what have heretofore been the phenomenological shadows of "Cartesian rationality." In doing so, it discovers dynamic signs of spectral alterity lodged both at the core and on the edges of modern Cartesian subjectivity. Calling for a Copernican reorientation of the very notion "Cartesianism," the book's series of close, creatively critical readings of Descartes' signature images brings the dramatic forces, moments, and scenes of the cogito into our own contemporary moment. The author patiently unravels the knotted skeins of ambiguity that have been spun within philosophical modernity out of such cliches as "Descartes, the abstract modern subject" and "Descartes, the father of modern philosophy"--a figure who is at once everywhere and nowhere. In the process, she revitalizes and reframes the legacy of Cartesian modernity, in a way more mindful of its proto-phenomenological traces.<br>

  Abstract: As a child, Francis Coppola often changed schools to keep pace with his father’s musical career. Growing up in various suburbs, he experienced ethnicity not as a way of life on the streets but as a way of relating within a middle-class family. Coppola the filmmaker constantly mirrors both this close-up familial vision of the self and anger towards the symbolic absent father. Although this conflicted familial vision might seem to negate the social values of John Ford and Frank Capra, Coppola does assert similar themes of family and home, law and decency and democracy in seemingly self-contradictory narratives: In<br>

Harry is excited by this idea; he links it with his rule, discovered earlier, about turning sentences around. He now realizes that his rule exemplifies certain kinds of relationships between things. Since they occur again and again throughout the story in different guises, it is important for us to understand the nature of these relationships. Furthermore, comprehending these relations will help us to explain why his rule<br>

Yet the importance of his contributions is not well known to many scholars, let alone a wider public.¹ This chapter focuses on Poliakov’s often unacknowledged contributions to the establishment of Holocaust studies and explores how he understood a key engine in the machinery of the destruction of European Jewry: anti-Semitism.<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

This evangelicalsimplicitasis linked to that humility, poverty and childlike innocence in which Jesus rejoices: ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes’ (nepiois; Matthew 11:25, compare Luke 10:21).

  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length ~<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

  Author(s) Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: Freud’s reading of Jewish history, centered around the return to group consciousness of the long repressed memory of the primeval Father, did not end with Moses or the Hebrew prophets. Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

A case can be made that he stands intellectually with Henry David Thoreau and Aldo Leopold as a thinker whose work yet exerts major influence on contemporary American ideas of wilderness. In instrumental terms, Muir is the father of the American conservation (now preservation) movement; his influence is most visibly manifest in<br>

The system of succession in this tetrarchy was non-hereditary, and Constantine’s attempt to become a member of the ruling Imperial college following the sudden death of his father amounted to a usurpation of legitimate authority, and<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Abstract: Friedrich D. Schleiermacher (1768–1834) is the founder of modern Protestant theology, as well as the father of modern hermeneutics. When he lived in Berlin, Schleiermacher was in close personal contact with Friedrich Schlegel and the other Romantics, kindling his interest in hermeneutics. Schleiermacher argues that the universe is active and reveals itself to us at every moment. An impact of the universe on us is to accept everything individual as a part of the whole. Individual ability depends upon the prior activity of the universe. Our place in the universe (or “being-in-the-world” in Heideggarian fashion) transcends both our cognitive<br>

  Abstract: Our attempt to understand the unity of being in terms of gift so far has brought to light the primal character of gift. Gift is a primal, a principle, inasmuch as it is a permanent source. The positivity of concrete singular beings suggested by originary experience rests on the permanent, personal principle of originating and ordering, a Father whose face we are invited to see in his beloved, Incarnate Son. Gift is also a primal because it indicates “first-ness.” According to this second sense of “primal,” being’s primordial unity is an ever-new beginning. Each concrete singular being is created; it<br>

An underlying theme of this volume is that Husserl is constantly returning to origins, revising his thought in the light of new knowledge offered by the sciences.<br>

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty.

  Abstract: Of the notion that a reform of Islamic thinking is, by and large, not a matter for clerics, Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari may stand as a living counter-proof. In addition, Shabestari proves that to think about Islam in a new way doesn’t invariably lead to exile. Shabestari is a Shi‘ite cleric who holds the rank of

Unsurprisingly, the journal’s political loyalties were equally mercurial. After cultivating a studious apoliticism, it lurched from the most rigid Stalinist orthodoxy to an equally fervent embrace of Cultural Revolutionary China—an instance of revolutionary romanticism that culminated in a celebrated 1974 trip to Beijing. As Communist Party loyalists, the Telquelians “missed out” on May 1968. In a now-legendary episode, Sollers—whose father, incidentally, was a leading Bordeaux industrialist—actively denounced the<br>

At first glance, variations might appear to be “the most superficial of forms, … a work suited for a lacemaker rat her than a Beethoven”. But when the son-writer deciphers the unfinished gesture of his dying father-musicologist, he comes to understand that the form of variations is a voyage “into the infinite internal variety which is hidden in every thing”.

Beyond the fact the she bore her father’s name (not irrelevant in a party where the leader had always embodied its very essence), Marine received massive support during an internal primary—67.65 percent—anunprece dented level of support in the FN, in a race which had pitted her against Bruno Gollnisch.<br>

  Abstract: This inquiry interprets a fourth-century Church Father’s main work in reference to social justice, a characteristic theme in Catholic social thought and Catholic social teaching.¹ The overall perspective is postcritical in the sense of probing for a relation between an ancient text and a modern or postmodern context in Church and world. That approach does not derogate from critical study, on which it relies, though a postcritical purpose inherently assumes that readers from later contexts can bring new questions to the text as well as submit to its otherness.

  Abstract: In recent studies Michel Barnes and Lewis Ayres have drawn attention to a broad consensus among fourth-century defenders of Nicaea, in particular the Cappadocians and Augustine. They have highlighted how these theologians argue for the full divinity of the Son and the Holy Spirit and their equality with the Father on the grounds that the activity of the three persons in the created world is one, and hence their nature is one. Thus, when Scripture speaks of one of them acting, the other two must be present and active, too, and together they produce a single activity.¹ Ayres concludes from<br>

  Author(s) Schmitz Kenneth L.<br>
  Abstract: A persistent question regarding the gratuity of gift remains unanswered. As the previous elucidation has shown, Bruaire’s ontodology perceives gift as the proper name of both absolute and finite spirit, and not only for creation. Considering the absolute spirit in terms of gift requires a conception of its oneness in terms of multiplicity; that is to say, while remaining one, its nature as absolute determinate spirit makes it relational within itself. Therefore, God, out of his own goodness, begets the Word, the perfect expression of himself. If God’s essence is gift, and the Word adequately expresses what the Father is,<br>

  Abstract: From the West as well as the East, among Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, Christian theologians now regularly suggest that western theology suffers from a “pneumatological deficit.” The Western theological tradition accounts for the temporal actions of the triune God, so these critics worry, without giving the Holy Spirit anything to do. In contrast to the Father and especially the Son, the Spirit has no action of his own, and no property, effect, or relationship to us that is unique to him.

Key works of detective fiction in the twentieth century, especially in its latter half, represent a distinct departure from Poe’s “tales of ratiocination” and, indeed, from traditional hermeneutics.² Before we can delineate this later<br>

Unsurprisingly, the journal’s political loyalties were equally mercurial. After cultivating a studious apoliticism, it lurched from the most rigid Stalinist orthodoxy to an equally fervent embrace of Cultural Revolutionary China—an instance of revolutionary romanticism that culminated in a celebrated 1974 trip to Beijing. As Communist Party loyalists, the Telquelians “missed out” on May 1968. In a now-legendary episode, Sollers—whose father, incidentally, was a leading Bordeaux industrialist—actively denounced the<br>

  Abstract: Judaism and Christianity meet in scripture, which they share and about which they contend. In Common Ground Father Andrew Greeley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner present their characteristically candid - and often provocative - interpretations of the history, context, and meaning of scripture. Written in alternating chapters, Common Ground reveals how a rabbi understands Christ, Mary, and St Paul, and how a priest views creation, Abraham and Sarah, and the prophets. Neusner calls upon the ancient Rabbinic approach to scripture - the conversational dialogue of "Midrash" - while Greeley creatively renews the narrative tradition of Christianity. Together they show that differences in responses to scripture enrich the possibilities of biblical renewal.<br>

  Abstract: The Trobriand Islands are one of the most famous testing grounds of Freudian theory. It was on the basis of data gathered there in the 1910s that Malinowski shook the psychoanalytic establishment by questioning the universality of the Oedipus complex. In the Trobriands, Malinowski (1924) claimed, it is not the case that the male child wishes to kill his father and marry his mother, but rather that he wishes to marry his sister and kill his mother’s brother. Malinowski represented this alternative complex as consistent with the matrilineal social organization of the Trobrianders and suggested that the Oedipus complex proper<br>

  Abstract: Each essay considers what is known and understood about these concepts. The essays give particular attention to how relevant ideas, themes, and terms were developed, elaborated, and deployed in the work of James W. Carey, the "founding father" of cultural studies in the United States. The contributors map how these important concepts, including Carey's own work with them, have evolved over time and how these concepts intersect. The result is a coherent volume that redefines the still-emerging field of critical cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: Samuel Delany’s memoir begins with this laconic sentence: “My father had been sick almost a year.”¹ His journey of remembering sets out from and is oriented toward the emotional landmark of his father’s illness and death. That landmark, however, is no signpost, stone marker, or architectural structure heavily anchored to a place and drawn on a map.

Freud’s unconscious is a seductive delinquent, always on the go, tracking down desire and its infinite partial objects. Oblivious to debts, to logic and justice, it moves steadily toward death in search of the intervention of a father figure in front of whom it refuses to yield.

The depiction of the Father in relation to the Son dramatizes the poet’s interest in the connection between the Hebraic and the Christian, between the Old Covenant and its reformulation, especially by Paul, in the New Covenant. Milton, so the critical view goes, was more reluctant than some of his contemporaries to relinquish the legacy of Christianity’s Jewish heritage, a legacy to which he and many others lay claim in<br>

  Author(s): Weiss Julian<br>
  Abstract: Professor Alan Deyermond was one of the leading British Hispanists of the last fifty years, whose work had a formative influence on medieval Hispanic studies around the world. There were several tributes to his work published during his lifetime, and it is fitting that this one, in his memory, should be produced by Tamesis, the publishing house that he helped establish and to which he contributed so much as author and editor right up to his death. The contributors to this volume are some of Professor Deyermond's former colleagues, doctoral students, and members of the Medieval Hispanic Research Seminar. Given Professor Deyermond's breadth of expertise, the span of the essays is appropriately wide, ranging chronologically from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century, and covering lyric, hagiography, clerical verse narrative, frontier balladry, historical and codicological studies. The volume opens with a personal memoir of her father by Ruth Deyermond, and closes with the draft of an unpublished essay found amongst Professor Deyermond's papers, and edited by his literary executor, Professor David Hook. Andrew M. Beresford is Reader and Head of Hispanic Studies at the University of Durham. Louise M. Haywood is Reader in Medieval Iberian Literary and Cultural Studies, and Head of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Cambridge.

It also called in question the ethically and juridically grounded models of royal rule as sanctioned by providence, promoted among them by the secular court culture of Enrique’s father Juan ii.

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DUFAYS SOPHIE<br>
  Abstract: Este libro constituye la primera monografía dedicada al papel del niño en el cine latinoamericano. El análisis detallado de una decena de películas argentinas de la post-dictadura dirigidas entre 1983 y 2008, incluyendo tanto clásicas (La historia oficial, Un lugar en el mundo) como olvidadas (Amigomio, El rigor del destino), revela cómo la mirada y el lenguaje del niño son puestos al servicio de una alegoría nostálgica, estructurada en torno a la memoria o al lenguaje verbal y vinculada a la figura del padre ausente. Dufays combina los análisis fílmicos con una amplia reflexión teórica sobre las cuatro nociones clave de alegoría, melancolía, nostalgia y duelo y los articula con una genealogía de la figura alegórica del niño en las tradiciones narrativas latinoamericanas. Este recorrido permite al lector explorar las significaciones simbólicas y discursivas que el personaje infantil, la infancia y la familia han adquirido en el cine y en el contexto postdictatorial argentino. Sophie Dufays es investigadora postdoctoral del Fondo Nacional de Investigación Científica de Bélgica, en la Universidad de Louvain-la-Neuve. This book is the first monograph devoted to the role of the child in Latin American cinema. Through close analysis of about ten Argentine fiction films of the post-dictatorship period directed between 1983 and 2008, including both classic such as The Official Story and A Place in the World) and forgotten works such as Amigomío and El rigor del destino. Dufays shows how the child's gaze and language are a means of focusing a nostalgic form of allegory, structured around either memory or verbal language, and related to the figure of the absent father. In combining these analyses with a wide theoretical articulation of four key notions (allegory, melancholy, mourning and nostalgia) and with a genealogy of the allegorical child character in Latin American narrative traditions, Relatos de infancia allows the reader to explore the meanings that childhood and fa~<br>

  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

  Author(s) COLDIRON A. E. B.<br>
  Abstract: IN the autumn of 1415, in the bloody aftermath of Agincourt field, Charles, duc d’Orléans, was pulled from beneath a heap of bodies and armor into a twenty-five-year English captivity. The historical import of this fact is considerable: this Prince of the house of Valois, later to become father of Louis XII and uncle of François I, would figure largely in the settlements ending the Hundred Years’ War. However, the literary results of Charles’s long imprisonment have not been much studied, given their significance and interest.¹ Captive in several prominent English households, Charles composed more than 13,000 lines of verse<br>

  Abstract: The catastrophic breakdown in relations with family and friends alike after the débâcle with Lou von Salomé and Paul Rée left Nietzsche isolated from almost everyone in his life. After his mother accused him of having besmirched the name of his father, Nietzsche packed his bags and left Naumburg for Leipzig in September 1882 (cf. KSB 6, 256 and 326); his sister, Elisabeth, was seemingly unable to understand why Nietzsche was so upset by this remark, but we should remember Nietzsche’s identification with his father, following his early death. Although the Pindaric imperative, “become who you are” that Nietzsche’s identification<br>

I don’tcarehow many people voted in the last election. When’s the music coming on?” The rejoinder was directed at the people around the table, not yelled out for all to hear and ponder. Kay’s dad and the others around the table chuckled. Later that evening, no one remembered the medley about the war. When asked about it, Jody said, “What medley?” She said she must have been inside, but the researcher saw that she had been at a table right in front of a loudspeaker the whole time.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: To this atom of kinship Juillerat juxtaposes a secondthe Oedipus complexwhose dynamic concerns the nuclear family. The excessive attachment of the son to the mother is disturbed by the father, leading to impossible patricidal fantasies. The resolution of this hyperconflictual situation, freeing the son from both his maternal attachment and his patricidal fantasies, promotes his desire for women outside the nuclear family. For Juillerat Oedipal resolution is preliminary to, if not a prerequisite for, the exchange of women, the structure of which is generated from the basic unit of kinship.
      Voilthe two systems are complementary. The atom of kinship is constituted as much from the interior as from the exteriorfrom the interior through the investment of affect, the repression of drives, Oedipal conflicts and their resolution, from the exterior, through the need for social and psychic exchange and communication (p. 124). Though Juillerat insists on taking the perspective of the different actors in these two dramas, it is ultimately the sons perspective that prevails.<br>

Abstract: Neal‘s account of the origin and early history of the Quakers in
      The History of the Puritanssignals another set of boundaries within the ranks of eighteenth‐century Dssent. Fox’s father is described as a “poor weaver,” which he was not. It is implied that Fox abandoned his apprenticeship to a shoemaker, though in fact he completed it. The account of Fox’s subsequent actions makes no explicit judgment against him, but in its chill distance it adopts the perspective of the powers that be. “It cannot be expected that such an unsettled People should have an uniform System of rational Principles,” Neal haughtily pronounces, and represents the early Quakers as uneducated, devoid of coherent principles, antisocial in their public behavior, and inculcating no secure set of moral values.52Neal’s concluding remarks even endorse the punitive measures of the commonwealth authorities against his fellow Dissenters. He is also icily patronizing about contemporary Quakers: “the Disturbances they gave to the publick Religion for a Course of many Years was so insufferable, that the Magistrates could not avoid punishing them as Disturbers of the Peace; though of late Years they are become a more sober and inoffensive People; and by the Wisdom of their Managers, have formed themselves into a Sort of Body politick.”53<br>

Abstract: Francisco Suarez speaks at length about the luminosity of Christ’s “glorious body.” The clarity (
            claritas) of the resurrected Christ derives from “the internal light of [his] glorious body” (Commentaria ac disputationes in tertiam partem D. Thomae, q. 54, art. 4, 845). As a glass of various colors becomes a luminous prism if exposed to the sun, so does the body of Christ show the transparency of a humanity perfectly permeated by the Father’s light (Commentaria ac disputationes, q. 54, art. 3, 812).<br>

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: Obedience to God unifies Christ’s identity by incorporating his powerless submission to the circumstances in which he finds himself and his love of neighbor. As Frei notes, at several central points in the passion narrative, where Jesus is powerless, he nonetheless turns others’ power to his own ends—either by appropriating their words or reshaping the significance of their action. Moreover, Jesus’s agency is far stronger in the Gospel of John than in the Synoptic Gospels.
         44John’s portrayal of Jesus’s agency also progressively emphasizes Jesus’s unity with the Father, such that what is presented at the beginning as the Father’s intention becomes Jesus’s own through the course of the story.45Frei presents this conjunction as demonstrating that one cannot simply highlight Jesus’s powerlessness in the Synoptic Gospels; rather, to be faithful to the narrative one must grasp both his power and his powerlessness, in these disparate depictions. This exemplifies what one might call a “narrative typology,” which, like Midrash, conjoins apparently disparate or conflicting texts so as to deepen the literal sense.<br>

Abstract: Having ended the formal prayer, the class continued with a kind of prayer accounting. Mrs. Barrett reviewed prayers students had mentioned in previous weeks’ classes, asking whether they had been answered. Had Raina’s mother found a job yet? Had Robert’s father found a new car? Had Dean’s injury healed? The students answered Mrs. Barrett’s queries, politely explaining which prayers needed to be continued and which could be ceased. Dean’s injury, for example, had mostly disappeared, such that when Mrs. Barrett asked if the class should still pray for him, he stipulated the caveat, “just a little bit, though.”<br>

Abstract: I combed through our family albums, which are numerous but well arranged and which have detailed photo coverage from the beginning of the twentieth century, with sporadic entries as far back as the mid‐nineteenth century. Obviously, the bulk of the photos come from the post–Second World War period, but the mausoleum was nowhere to be seen. Finally, in a small album containing stray images with no obvious theme, I found a small photograph of my parents with my Greek uncle Dimitris Trakidis from Thessaloniki. The photograph was taken at the mausoleum on my uncle's camera during his visit to Sofia in March 1957 and then sent by him to my parents. This “uncle” was really my father's cousin from Varna, who had emigrated to Greece as a high school student with his parents in the late 1930s but had continued his involvement with the Left. In the early 1960s, as a lawyer, he was one of the defendants in the famous Lambrakis case, and he remains a Communist to this day. The photograph I found is not only a gesture of memory from my uncle but also a gesture of defiance of his own authoritarian regime in Greece in the 1950s, which banned and persecuted Communism. Ironically, then, as a
         lieu de mémoireit would be classified more properly under the rubric of “remembering unrealized Communism” (in Greece) than under that of “remembering real Communism” (in Bulgaria;fig. 6).

Abstract: In order to develop a revised hermeneutical circle that can respond to the unique challenges of studying childhood, it is worth recalling that hermeneutics itself has a complex developmental history. Not coincidentally, Schleiermacher is the father of both the modern theology of childhood and modern hermeneutics. He it is, in the early nineteenth century, who moves hermeneutics beyond mere techniques for the exegesis of classic texts (especially scripture) into a general method of human social understanding. Schleiermacher adapts Kant’s critique of reason to argue for a new hermeneutics as the practice of “divining” behind human linguistic expressions the mysterious “genius” or “subjectivity” of the individual author.
         28Although the connection is not stated directly, childhood, for Schleiermacher, is a divine gift from God to the world that epitomizes this subjective hermeneutical mystery. Hermes as the messenger of the gods takes his purest and most complete form in each new baby that enters the world. Hermeneutics divines the kind of inner natural wisdom or intuition that each of us still in some way retains from childhood despite the inevitable corruptions and distortions of language and society. Likewise, childhood becomes a vital hermeneutical concern (no other major theologian has written as much on childhood as Schleiermacher) in part because it embodies the kind of sacred human inwardness that hermeneutics seeks to approach. It may not be going too far (though I cannot defend it here) to make the childist argument that Schleiermacher’s early writings on childhood deeply influence his later theology and hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: The term “
         tselem” or “image,” which occurs hardly anywhere else in the Bible, will shortly be used again, in fact, in Gen. 5:3, where Seth is said to be an “image” of his father, Adam. Somehowadam—in the sense of “humankind” generally—is originally an image of God in a similar way that a child may be said to be an image of its parent. (I return later to issues of gender.) Human beings are primordially—that is, mythically, originally, and prior to their fall—affirmed to have been created by God. But what this actually means, in part, is that they are also, even after the fall, affirmed to have been created in such a way as to be likewise capable of going on to create analogously for themselves. A similar double meaning can be found in the Latinimago Dei, where “imago” can suggest not only reproduction, copy, or shadow—as in the more obvious and static interpretation of Gen. 1:27—but also a more dynamic imitation, similitude, or likeness.<br>

Abstract: The JST account of Enoch’s theophany begins with God showing Enoch what will happen to the wicked among his grandson’s (Noah’s) generation. Their fate in this world and the afterlife not only causes the heavens to “weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains” but also moves God to weep. This mystifies Enoch, who asks, “How is it thou canst weep, seeing thou are holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?” The reply emphasizes God’s relationship to the earth’s inhabitants. Notwithstanding his “commandment, that they should love one another; and that they should choose me their Father … they are,” God explains, “without affection, and they hate their own blood.” After watching the devastation of the flood, Enoch’s attitude changes. In contrast to his initial shock that the Lord would mourn such as these, he now “wept over his brethren, and said unto the heavens, I will refuse to be comforted.” Enoch petitions God to promise that he will never again destroy the earth by flood. The JST provides: “the Lord could not withhold; and he covenanted with Enoch, and sware unto him an oath.” The promise is the familiar one, though it contains an additional element. God not only swears that “he would stay the floods,” but also that “he would call upon the children of Noah.” This additional promise echoes Smith’s characterization of Adam and Eve after their fall: separated from God but not out of the range of his voice. According to the JST, “the gospel was preached [unto Adam and Eve after their expulsion]; and a decree sent forth that it should be in the world until the end thereof; and thus it was.”
         84In the JST, human cooperation is a necessary element in the performance of this decree. In Smith’s cosmology, human communication with the divine is not only a necessary constant, but its message is that humans must assume responsibility for the execution of God’s plan for human salvation. This is more plainly evidenced by Enoch’s next request.<br>

Abstract: Rewritings of texts that are still under copyright illuminate this process. First published in Italian in 1995 and subsequently issued in a Dutch translation in 1996, Pera’s rewriting of
         Lolitafrom the eponymous character’s perspective was blocked from publication in the United States by Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri, who claimed copyright infringement. The case was settled with Dmitri Nabokov writing a preface to the novel and half of Pera’s royalties going to PEN (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, and Novelists).13According to Nabokov, Pera is trading on the celebrity ofLolita, “seek[ing] inspiration, fortune and fame” from his father’s world‐famous novel. Taking Pera’s lawyer up on his argument thatLo’s Diaryis a “transformative” work, Nabokov observes: “My Fair Lady,West Side Story, Stoppard’sRosencrantz and Guildenstern, Updike’sS, Jean Rhys’sWide Sargasso Sea… all had been safely tucked into the public domain when the ‘transformations’ were penned.Lolitaisn’t in the public domain, and won’t be until well into the next millennium when its copyright expires” (Nabokov1999, viii). The distinction, no doubt, is important; texts under copyright require dues to be paid, and their authors or estates can file suit to see their rights honored. Yet in their attempts to keep unauthorized rewritings at bay, they reveal a mechanism that is inherent to all rewriting, the effects of which are of the order of brand recognition.<br>

Abstract: In
         Fictional Truth, Michael Riffaterre sees the subtextual energy of fiction standing in the same relation to plot as does the unconscious in Freud to the system of conscious perception.29Like the unconscious, and revealed only in signs or symptoms of the otherwise functionally repressed, subtexts are therefore timeless, reversible, and cumulative. If denied maternity (its removal by death or its falsification) locates one such subtext inLittle Dorrit—strung along in counterpoint to the failed father motif, for instance—that matrilineal subtext has its perverse and unexpected returns across the marital trajectory of the son himself, as he is sped along the monorail of its domesticating engine toward the anticipated point of rest and its gender assimilation. Any such subtext, according to Riffaterre, is a phenomenon transcendent to change or if you will subtendent to it. It thereby lies, in the last sentence of his study, “outside the realm of time and … impervious to its ravages.”30Plot is the map of those ravages. Narratology understands this. Narratography would, as I say, reexperience it—and do so in a transferential exchange, against the medial flow, between a nervously cued attention and the insinuated unconscious of the text itself.<br>

Abstract: In the present article I have undertaken the examination of individual volition in Augustine, the church father who introduced the idea of “free will” (liberum arbitrium) in religious discourse. Augustine’s portentous contribution to the discussion of volition as a token of identity and a reflection of self‐awareness consists of the identification of desire with love. To Augustine, our soul (
         animus) is not a constant and immutable attribute, but the expression of a perfectible self, which wills its own optimal instantiation when it desires first and foremost to love. After discussing Augustine, I proceeded to examine the different way whereby Marcel, the protagonist ofÀ la recherche du temps perdu, curbs his own conscious volition, which he considers an incurable source of personal egoism, in order for his better self to surrender to the love buried in his unconscious memory.<br>

Article Title: Coleridge’s Philosophy of Prayer: Responsibility, Parergon, and Catachresis<br>

Abstract: I would like to conclude by noting that, of course, Coleridge’s poetry offers a particularly concrete representation of the struggles—linguistic, volitional, and existential—that surround the experience of prayer.
         70The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:
               While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish drea~<br>

Abstract: A somewhat comparable tradition in early Western war lore is the wearing of the cross in the time of Pope Urban. Contact with the cross was said to induce a blessing, based on Matt. 16:24 and Luke 14:27: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.” The derived blessing was also from Matthew: “Every one that has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold and shall possess life everlasting” (19:29). Riley‐Smith cites reports of crusaders hysterically branding crosses on their bodies, although more usually they just committed to wearing crosses sewn into their clothing until their vows were fulfilled.

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Unlike Lévinas, Blanchot's concern for Judaism is not motivated by the practical concerns of reviving the tradition in the postwar context. He is free of the necessities of community leadership, free from any pragmatics concerning the tradition. For Blanchot, Judaism is a concept, one he has discovered through reading Lévinas along with Edmond Jabès and Franz Kafka. Its message is encapsulated in the commandment to Abraham in Genesis 12:
         Lech Lecha, “Go forth from your father's house.” Blanchot reads this commandment as a prohibition against putting down roots, not only in a particular place but also in any statement of the truth. Like Lévinas, Blanchot sees this counsel of dispersion as having fundamental importance in the post-World War II world, an importance that has little to do with the lived tradition and everything to do with developing a political position antithetical to fascism. Blanchot accepts Lévinas's depiction of Judaism and takes the idea a step further by reading Lévinas's principle of moral deracination as advocating absolute disappropriation. He writes inThe Infinite Conversation,
               
         there is a truth of exile and there is a vocation of exile; and if being Jewish is being destined to dispersion—just as it is a call to a sojourn without place, just as it ruins every fixed relation of force with
            oneindividual,onegroup, oronestate—it is because dispersion, faced with the exigency of the whole, also clears the way for a different exigency and finally forbids the temptation of Unity-Identity.24<br>

Abstract: Let me just say, for the record, that this is a vast understatement. Orlean goes into astonishing depth on other orchid fanciers like Martin Motes, Savilla Quick, and Bob Fuchs; and not only does she give us more detail than we could ever need about Fuchs, but she goes on to inform us about his father, Freddie, an orchid hunter, his grandfather, Fred, explorer of the swamp, and even his
         great-grandfather, Charles, who moved to Florida and tried to become a farmer before going back to baking. (Finally, after a full ten pages of filler, she returns to the point of the whole digression: a robbery at Fuchs's nursery.) Not content with mentioning one Lee Moore, a man on trial for plant smuggling, she tells us about his childhood, his father, his wife, Chady, the various irrelevant things he and his wife have to say, the list of flowers he has discovered, the newsletter he used to produce, a near-death experience he has had, and his sideline as an antiquities thief. When at last Orlean asks him if he happens to know John Laroche, “Lee squinted and rubbed his chin. ‘Don't think I know the fellow,’ he said” (OT, p. 199).12Orlean is already flailing for the right story to tell. How is Charlie expected to do any better?<br>

Abstract: In this light it is worth considering the puzzlement of Meyer Fortes in his study of Tallensi religion and morality over why the Tallensi so deemphasize and marginalize the notion of witchcraft in their theory of human nature and causality. Fantasies of sexual aggression, soul cannibalism, and gross immorality that invert and repudiate normal humanity typical of African witchcraft beliefs are “quite alien to Tallensi ways of thought” (
         1987:213). Fortes resolves this puzzlement in a comparison between the Tallensi and Ashanti, among whom witchcraft is highly elaborated, tracing the difference to family and descent group organization. The Tallensi individual’s identity is given a firm anchorage in the complementarity of legal father-right and spontaneous mother love, the enclosed family, and localized lineage, creating a benign domestic environment guaranteed by a cult of ancestors. The Ashanti individual is pulled two ways between matrilineal uncle-right and supposedly spontaneous care from the father, leading to preoccupation with purity and pollution, personal sensitivity and vulnerability, and high personal autonomy combined with a divided sense of identity. The relative weakness of Tallensi witchcraft can be accounted for by the experiential ramifications of these differences: among the Tallensi the survival to adulthood of a developmentally early basic trust whereas the Ashanti culture enshrines basic mistrust; a Tallensi conscience externalized to parent surrogates and understood in affective terms aspu-teemor “stomach-thinking” that contrasts with Ashanti conscience rooted in personal responsibility and understood in intellectual terms asti-boaor “head creature”; and Tallensi wrongdoing being treated as an issue among the individual, his kin, and the ancestors, whereas Ashanti violation of taboos is a sacrilege attributed to individual wickedness and dangerous to the community that must be adjudicated by the chief and his council (216).<br>

Abstract: It is impossible to cite all the relevant readings, so a few representatives will have to suffice. Stanley Cavell is among those who see Cordelia’s reply as an expression of confusion. Richard Halpern is less forgiving, emphasizing the cruelty of Cordelia’s words and relating them to the more vicious revenges of Goneril and Regan. Eugene England tries to recuperate the painfulness of Cordelia’s response by portraying her as a therapist/savior who only hurts her father to heal him. See Stanley Cavell,
         Disowning Knowledge in Seven Plays of Shakespeare, updated ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2003), 62–64; Richard Halpern,The Poetics of Primitive Accumulation: English Renaissance Culture and the Genealogy of Capital(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991), 248–49; and Eugene England, “Cordelia and Paulina: Shakespeare’s Healing Dramatists,”Literature and Belief2 (1982): 69–82.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: In traditional (Augustinian) terms, it means that ecclesia must be
      semper reformanda, which is to say, it needs to preserve a constant potential for radical reformation that can be drawn only from the novelty of evental grace. The church, like every institution, is susceptible to the tendency of withdrawing into a particularism of its own that can easily lead to its becoming parochial and eventually degenerate into a private but harmless eccentricity of a minority. That is why Badiou’s emphasis on the uniqueness of evental grace as the only source of the subject’s identity appears to be so relevant. Christ’s resurrection summons ecclesia to become a “new Israel,” and not a “second Israel,” that is, another particular community alongside Israel and many others; it engenders the courage to be constantly people on the way, boldly crossing all borders, instead of turning the faith in the Resurrected into a “heritage of the fathers,” an inherited property that reduces the “Father of Jesus Christ” to the “God of the fathers.” Put briefly, from the very beginning Christianity has been established as a religion that would surpass religion.
               (Isn’t this what Bonhoeffer means when he states that “Christ does not bring a new religion; rather, he brings God”?178
            
               ). Halík points out that such a position is a radical emulation of Saint Paul who presents Christianity, not as an aspect of some orthodoxy or orthopraxis, but as a faith capable of dissociating itself from its past, ridding itself of old customs and certainties, rejecting particularity, and going to others.179
            
               In this context, “Paul’s crossing of the borders of Israel and setting out for the ‘people’ (the pagans) should be a paradigm for the entire history of the church.”180
            
               Christians must not make light of the Gospel’s novelty by clinging to the past and remaining in the narrow confines of particular traditions fun~<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Abstract: "Moses and Monotheism" is Freud's last book on religion. It was published in its entirety only after his flight from Nazi-occupied Vienna. Moses is perhaps Freud's most controversial book on religion. It is both an apology and a curse. It is a critique of traditional Judaism (by way of an Oedipal analysis of a deified Moses), a defence of a modern humanistic Judaism (a Judaism of moral and intellectual values), and a bitter critique of Christianity (a religion not of the Father but of the sons, a failed religion, which expresses its failure in anti-Semitism). A defiant and rebellious book, one might say, one in which an old man rises to meet his fate and does so with surprising wilfulness and vigour. But Moses also reveals a dogmatic Freud defending a critique of religion that is intellectually flawed and politically misdirected.<br>

Abstract: Mielziner, op. cit., pp. 152-155, for example, discussesheqqesh in an appendix to his
discussion of gezerah shavah, though he also acknowledges that it bears some similarity to
semukhim, "juxtaposition" (p. 177). He contends that the rabbis regarded arguments from
heqqesh as being usually more conclusive than those from gezerah shavah. Bacher,o/>. cit., p. 45,
remarks, "The term הקיש (i.e., the verbal form) may also be used for the comparison of two
biblical sentences accomplished on the basis of the deductive rule gezerah shavah." As exam-
pies he gives the series of analogies offered in Mek. Bahodesh viii: 13-28 between the hon-
oring of father and mother and the honor of God. He concludes that in the School of Ish-
mael the term להקיש can be used to introduce arguments from gezerah shavah.<br>

Abstract: This paper asks, why does the eponymous hero of Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim fail to obtain absolution despite two confessional attempts, and then seek his own death? By using narratological distinctions together with an analysis of the confessional structures of Jim's narratives, we find that his confessions fail for three reasons: he never fulfils his promise to Marlow to plot the 'fundamental why' of his jumping ship, his father's 'easy morality' condemns him even before he abandons the Patna, and Marlow fails to meet his role as confessor.<br>

Abstract: Religious echoes are resonant with race and gender in Beloved, raising questions best posed in a psychoanalytic register. Freud's sceptical questioning of religion is important for a consideration of the gendered, raced, and specifically religious subjectivities explored in the novel, as is Lacan's paradigm of entry into the symbolic order. Reading the religious in Beloved in light of both Freud and Lacan, and reading the poetically evocative Word in all three, I locate within the novel a profound ambivalence, an awareness of the limitations of language under the Name of the Father and the necessity—even potential good—of imagining within its system.<br>

Author(s): Tschuggnall Peter<br>
Abstract: Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) prepared the ground for individual fighters on philosophical-literary topics in the twentieth Century. In his writings he chooses the most varying problems as a starting point for his assessment of the existing relations between the Church and the World. As Kierkegaard fights for the individual, he criticizes the power of the masses over the quality of life of the individual citizen. He also criticizes the moralizing attempts of the "paid" clergy to make their demands on the individual believer. Following Theodor W. Adorno, Kierkegaard is to be read with a permanent considération for Kierkegaard himself. Autobiographical notices make it clear, that he is caught up in a constant struggle with himself. His both happy and tragical relationship with Regine Olson, which ended when he broke off their engagement, was the décisive impulse for him to become a "religious writer". It is to his former fiancée and his father that he dedicates his life's work, in which mostly Pseudonyms – as an indirect way of communication – express his existence. Kierkegaard mentions three essential levels or stages of life: the aesthetical outlook on life and the ethical, both of which are "catégories", finally, the religious outlook, which is more an "atmosphère". These stages can both follow each other, and also pervade one another. They are accompanied by the borderline catégories of irony and humour. These three phases do not simply depict a mode of abstract thinking, but also deal with concrète situations in life, as are those involved in passion, fear, misery and despair.<br>

Abstract: In a will of 1335, Piero Morosini bequeathed to each of his daughters 1,000 lire ad grossos
(roughly 385 ducats) for her dowry and corredo, 'secundum usum nobilium dominarum de Veneciis'
('as is customary for noble women in Venice'); ASV, Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 1154, Bruto, no.
32. In a civil action of 1382, the Giudici del Procurator ordered that the estate of Federico Corner
should add to his dowry allocation to his daughters 'quid deffecerit congruentie' ('what it lacks to
make it suitable') in order to carry out Federico's testamentary provision that the daughters receive
'quelo che besogna per maridarle' ('what is necessary for their marriages'); ASV, Giudici del Pro-
curator, 'Sentenze a Legge', Reg. 2, fol. 114". In 1385 Nicolô Morosini ordered in his will that if his
descendants should lack the means of providing dowries for their daughters, then his bequest to them
in immovables might be sold to 'maridarle segondo la condicion soa' ('arrange marriages appropriate
to their status'); Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 679, Bellancini, prot., fol. 26v. In his will of 1416
Giovanni Morosini instructed his brothers to add enough from his estate to their father's bequest of
1,400 ducats for the marriage of their sister 'ut ipsa cum honore et prout congruit conditionem
domus mee honorificentius maritetur' ('in order that she may marry as honorably as possible and in a
manner befitting the status of my house'); ibid. Busta 1234, Sorio, no. 509.
Fathers also specified that they wanted their daughters to marry noble husbands; Andrea Ari-
mondo in 1427 declared that each of his daughters was to be married 'in uno zentilomo de Veniesia'
('to a Venetian gentleman') (ASV, Cancelleria Inferiore, 'Miscellanea Testamenti', Notai Diversi,
Busta 27, no. 2697); that same year Michele Navagero instructed his executors that his daughter 'se
debia maridar in zentil homo' ('should marry a gentleman') (ASV, Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta
1157, Croci, prot. Il, fol. 14r). In the Qu~<br>

Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i25654931<br>
Date: 7 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Fortin Jutta<br>
Abstract: This article examines how three contemporary French texts explore two distinct but related preoccupations, mourning and photography. Just as Roland Barthes's La Chambre claire provides a space in which the author may think about photography and simultaneously address his difficulty in mourning his late mother, so François Bon's Mécanique can be regarded as a tribute to the author's father, as well as a meta-reflection on photography. In Mummy, mummies Alain Fleischer relates the practice of mummification to photography; the article argues that the insistence on the mummies of Ferentillo throughout the work obliquely refers to the lack of mourning characteristic of the Holocaust.<br>

Abstract: That Cassian should posit some sort of intrinsic connection between the
soul aflame with love of God and the filial adoption implied in the term "Our
Father" is interesting. It is evocative of a relatively common image in patristic
literature for divinization: wood being burned until it gradually takes on the
properties of fire. The doctrinal thèmes of synergy, divinization, adoption, cré-
ation, and rédemption all Cluster here.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: The critique of these bourgeois values was developed by writers after Freud, particu-
larly by Marcuse. From the latter's perspective, Freud's concept of the super-ego is anachro-
nistic: in modernity no genuine individuation and autonomy are acquired by the institution of
the super-ego, since the father and other close figures are no longer significant in forming this
psychic agency. 'Under the rule of economic, political, and cultural monopolies', Marcuse
writes, 'the formation of the mature super-ego seems to skip the stage of individuation: the
generic atom becomes directly a social atom. The repressive organization of the instinct
seems to be collective, and the ego seems to be prematurely socialized by a whole system of
extra-familial agents and agencies' (p. 97). This understanding of the super-ego and of the
resultant 'surplus repression' leads Marcuse to demand radical reorganization of social and
economic institutions in a manner that differs from Freud' s cautiousness and adherence to the
bourgeois order. See Marcuse, Eros and Civilization.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330173<br>
Date: 9 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Morton John<br>
Abstract: Central Australian Aboriginal `increase ritual' has often been seen exclusively as an attempt to control environmental forces. Following Durkheim's early arguments against this view, and expanding them to encompass a psychoanalytic perspective, it is argued that the direct effect of so-called `increase ritual' is psychological, but that this effect has consequences for the maintenance of resources in a hunter-gatherer society. `Increase ritual', as Durkheim suggested, is structured as a form of sacrifice. It is also, as Freud suggested, linked to the death of the father. It is argued here that these symbolic themes relate practically to the control which mature men exercise over the reproduction of the social and natural orders.<br>

Abstract: O estudo visa apresentar os supostos teóricos e as tensões essenciais da tematização da ideia de Quinto Império na Defesa Perante o Tribunal do Santo Ofício, do P.e António Vieira. A visão profética de Vieira assume o contraste entre um tempo de inautenticidade na relação teândrica, subsidiário da Queda adâmica e objectivado na sucessão dos quatro impérios (cf. Daniel, 2, 27-45), e a novidade absoluta do acontecimento de Cristo, que se espera vir a manifestar-se na pacificação terrena do processo histórico e na constituição duma comunidade universal segundo o Espírito. A tese, que só um estudo ulterior poderá demonstrar, é a de que a perspectiva do Quinto Império, em Vieira, será, ainda subsidiária das categorias dominantes no tempo dos quatro impérios, em que a experiência escatológica se refracta antropocentricamente pelas finalidades, e relações de poder, político-civilizacionais. /// Cette étude presente les présupposés théoriques et les tensions essentielles de Ia thématisation de Tidée de Cinquième Empire dans Ia Défense Auprès du Tribunal du Saint-Office, du P.

Abstract: Augustine's conversion is considered exemplary for its Christian testimony. However, the psychological aspects are also relevant, for Augustine's conversion to Christianity was as much inspired by personal and cultural ambitions as by religious convictions. For Augustine, the conversion to the Christian faith spelled a life of asceticism— a life of celibacy, a virtuous and chaste existence, which also offered him a means of escape from the threatening ambiguity of parental relations and a chance to realize the cultural ideal of the civilized philosopher who has subjugated the passions of the flesh. In this paper we explore the psychological dynamics of the absent father, the suffering mother and the prodigal son and the role they played in Augustine's conversion to Christianity.<br>

Issue: i40039577<br>

Author(s): VERMEULEN E. E. G.<br>
Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: The short novel, Will-o'-the-Wisp ('Het dwaallicht') by the Antwerpian (Belgian) author Willem Elsschot, narrates how one night Laarmans, a somewhat tired middle-aged husband and father, accompanies three Afghan seamen on a search for a woman, Maria Van Dam. The search leads them through the harbouring city, and ultimately fails. The work is enigmatic and invites the reader to engage with it creatively, adventurously and not without commitment. The reader discovers in this way not only what it means to interpret, but also that by questioning one's own contribution in the understanding of being, interpretation serves as a challenge to clarify one's existence. The enigma of Will-o'-the-Wisp is never solved, but the search for understanding what happened during that nightly search provides a model for every practical methodology of hermeneutics, and can therefore be considered a parable about the nature of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This paper attempts to compare two lives, that of Ramana Maharshi, the beloved cereberal sage of South India, and Sigmund Freud, the founding father of psychoanalysis. Much has been written on both these individuals, so what this paper does is to focus on affliction as a source of insight about life, detachment, pain, existentialism and coping. By taking narratives which delineate a historical plane on which illness can be coded, I try to understand the anthromorphic nature of suffering and its consequences in these two great lives. Individuals reflect the culture of which they are a part, so what we receive through the narratives which tell us about them is significant in terms of their similarities and their differences. Who authors narratives which we analyse is of utmost significance, and both feminism and narrative analyses looks at social anthropology as benefiting from the question of the writing subject. The Nirvana principle works in Ramana Maharshi's case to create a comfort zone for helping us to think of death as dream, in Freud it works as a comfort zone to cope with existence. Human beings work with ideas in order to evaluate the nature of life and survival, or with death as an attribute which too is natural and part of the order of reality. Paul Ricoeur's work helps me to build a bridge between the two thinkers, Ramana Maharshi and Freud, in terms of the application of the concepts of Eros, Thanatos and Ananke.<br>

Abstract: Following the Prologue (John 1,1-18), the Gospel of John is demarcated by an inclusio which extends from 1,19 ("And this is the witness of John") to 21,24 (" This is the disciple who bears witness"). This Gospel contains a multiple witness to Jesus as Messiah and as Son of God (cf. 20,31), organized around two main characters: John (1,19 → 10,42) and the beloved disciple (13,1 → 21,25). In the central unit (11, → 12,50), which serves as a link between the two sections, the Father intervenes by rising up Lazarus (11,41-44) and makes His own voice heard from heaven (12.28); through these events the Father bears the supreme witness to Jesus. In this way, the Gospel appears as a testimonial triptych with a christological purpose.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i40105000<br>

Author(s): Fouéré Marie-Aude<br>
Abstract: Julius Nyerere a joué un rôle essentiel dans l'union de Zanzibar et de l'ancien Tanganyika, qui a formé la Tanzanie. Pére de la nation tanzanienne, son image est cependant toute différente chez les nationalistes de Zanzibar, qui en font un étranger et un adversaire. En dépliant ce discours nationaliste, Marie-Aude Fouéré brosse en creux et par petites touches le portait de Nyerere à Zanzibar et montre qu'un père de l'indépendance peut surtout être perçu comme un ennemi dans la périphérie d'un nouvel État. Un récit collectif dépréciatif sur le premier président de Tanzanie, Julius Nyerere, se difruse aujourd'hui dans les îles de Zanzibar. Au regard de la trajectoire mémorielle de Julius Nyerere en Tanzanie continentale, caractérisée par une constante surenchère de déférence, Zanzibar fait figure d'exception. L'article présente les termes de ce récit péjoratif sur Nyerere en rapport à deux épisodes centraux dans l'histoire des îles: la révolution de 1964, mythe de la nation zanzibarie libre et souveraine, et l'Union avec le Tanganyika. Il montre aussi comment ce récit dépréciatif entre en résonance avec la question musulmane qui, à Zanzibar, est consubstantielle à un positionnement identitaire collectif. L'article conclut que, dans une société sans père de la nation ni récit national unifié, Julius Nyerere constitue un récit de la nation en négatif. A derogatory collective narrative around the first President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, circulates in the islands of Zanzibar today. Against Nyerere's ever more deferential memorial trajectory in mainland Tanzania, Zanzibar stands out as an exception. This article presents the outline of this pejorative account of Nyerere in relation to two major events in the history of the Isles: the Revolution of 1964, myth of a free and sovereign Zanzibari nation; and the Union with Tanganyika. It also shows how this derogatory narrative is connected to the Muslim question which, in Zanzibar, amounts to a collective identity position~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Abstract: Penelope Fitzgerald's first novel The Golden Child is often considered apart from her subsequent novels, mainly because it is detective fiction. Though her uncle, Father Ronald Knox, was a well-respected master of this genre, Fitzgerald came to it with certain misgivings, which were especially pronounced when she considered its limitations against the achievements of modern fiction. However, those elements of the detective genre that may be found in The Golden Child did, along with the underlying interest in the question of authority, carry forward into her own more modern achievements in the novel.<br>

Abstract: La question posée par Pilate à Jésus s'éclaire par l'usage de l'adverbe interrogatif en grec profane et biblique, par le contexte de l'entrevue et surtout par les douze autres emplois de pothen dans l'évangile de Jean. Au-delà de l'origine galiléenne de Jésus de Nazareth est suggérée une autre origine, chez « le Père », « celui qui l'a envoyé ». Cette double origine de Jésus rejoint l'intention principale du quatrième évangile. The question that Pilate puts to Jesus become clear with help of the context and still more in the light of twelve other uses of pothen in the Fourth Gospel, all related to Jesus. Over and above his Galilean origin another origin is suggested, from "the Father", "who has sent him". Such an allusion to Jesus' double origin is at the heart of the Gospel of St. John.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Abstract: La réception de Kierkegaard en France marque les années 1930-1960. Contemporaine de l'introduction de Heidegger, Jaspers et Barth et de l'approfondissement de la connaissance de Hegel, elle concourt à l'éclosion des philosophies de l'existence en France. Nous l'étudions en fonction de la notion de transferts culturels. Dans les années trente, elle repose sur un milieu étroit. Kierkegaard incarne une figure de modernité philosophique et religieuse. En le commentant, Jean Wahl et Léon Chestov constituent une grammaire de l'existence. Après guerre, l'existentialisme triomphe sous les auspices de Sartre et Merleau-Ponty et Kierkegaard est consacré « père de l'existentialisme ». Les penseurs chrétiens en font le rempart de l'athéisme; les autres le laïcisent : l'angoisse l'emporte sur le « devant Dieu ». The reception of Kierkegaard in France marks the years 1930-1960. Contemporary with the introduction of Heidegger, Jaspers and Barth and with the deepening of the understanding of Hegel, it conspires with the blossoming of philosophies of existence in France. This paper studies it in connection with the notion of cultural exchanges. During the thirties, it remains confined to a narrow circle. Kierkegaard embodies philosophical and religious modernity. Commenting upon it, Jean Wahl and Leon Chestov construct a grammar of existence. After the war, existentialism triumphs under the auspices of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, and Kierkegaard is acclaimed as the « father of Existentialism ». Christian thinkers make of him the rampart of atheism; others secularize him. Anxiety prevails against the « before God ».<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219736<br>
Date: 3 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Bogel Dianne F.<br>
Abstract: Little Dorrit is both a narrative about authority and an examination of the authority of narrative. The novel links vocation with sonhood and storytelling with fatherhood and self-generation. Little Dorrit, however, tells a double story, of a daughter as well as of a son. If the son's story relates the search to replace the father and to discover paternal authority, the daughter's story details the horrors and consolations of incestuous desire and generational collapse. Storytelling that seeks the father as origin reveals paternal deception and inauthenticity; incestuous structures of desire attempt to collapse genealogy on the hero and heroine, making paternal origin unknowable and creating an overdetermined narrative ending. Dickens' double story, then, identifies yet questions genealogy and the patriarchal family as metaphors for narrative structure.<br>

Abstract: This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of the “(as yet) untold story” to consider the relationship between James Joyce's 1904 short story “Eveline” (in
         Dubliners) and Colm Tóibín's award-winning 2009 novel,Brooklyn. Although Tóibín has denied the influence of Joyce in general, there are many similarities in the storyworlds of the two protagonists, Eveline Hill and Eilis Lacey: Eveline wishes to leave her father's home in Dublin but stays, whilst Eilis would prefer to remain at home but is forced to emigrate. Both act according to their perception of their mother's wishes and the rightness of their decisions has preoccupied readers. Through close analysis of thought and speech presentation, this essay shows that interpretive responses to the actions of Eveline and Eilis are inextricably linked to the formal qualities of each text.<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Abstract: The philosophy of history was classically conceived as a form of theodicy—justifying God's ways to man, as Milton put it. Saint Augustine is considered by some to be the father of the philosophy of history, though the term itself was apparently invented by Voltaire. And Augustine didn't use the faux-Greek word
      theodicyeither, which wasn't invented until the time of Leibniz. But he thought of it this way. The Roman Empire had recently converted to Christianity and should have been flourishing and increasing in glory. Instead it was rapidly declining and falling before his very eyes. This didn't make sense. What was wrong?<br>

Abstract: The ultimate setting of the creation of SPEP was Harvard in the 1950s. The founding father of SPEP is John Wild (1902–1972), who taught at Harvard from 1927 to 1961 and who had spent 1931–32 in Freiburg hearing the lectures of Heidegger and Husserl. Wild's study of Heidegger came to fruition for him only after he read Merleau-Ponty, which sent Wild back to the sources and led him to give courses on Heidegger at Harvard.
               
                     This occasioned his own shift from realism to phenomenology and his departure from Harvard to Northwestern, where he established one of the two major programs in Continental philosophy at the time outside the Catholic institutions, the other being the New School of Social Research, and then moved on to Yale. To Wild's presence at Harvard we should add the arrival of Paul Tillich in the United States, first at Union Theological Seminary (1933–55) and then at Harvard (1955–62; and finally at Chicago). Students at Harvard in the 1950s had the remarkable opportunity to study existentialism and phenomenology with Tillich and Wild.12<br>

Abstract: The two essays that follow situate their gaze on Shaw's cosmology. Jay Tunney's moving, evocative piece, “The Spiritual Shaw,” again affirms the profundity of Shaw's close relationship with his father, Gene. The extraordinary experience on the island of Brioni was a powerful moment in Shaw's ongoing reflection about the intersection of the physical and metaphysical, manifested (among other places) in his keenness for boxing. Witnessing Polly Tunney's painful and near-fatal appendicitis attack, Gene's faith, and the miraculous arrival of two medical saviors, Shaw was deeply affected by what Tunney describes as the “simplicity and enormity of the circumstance,” and thereafter “prayer broadened his definition of the human spirit.” With the reputed interconnection between health and hope as his starting point, Howard Ira Einsohn also explores Shaw's moral and religious philosophy in “Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur: Emissaries of Hope, Faith, and Wellness.” Einsohn's commentary traces convergences in the thinking of both figures to articulate how Shaw's tragic-optimism acts as “his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.”<br>

Abstract: Moreover, the astute logician in Shaw sees the newborn child as a commissioned envoy of divinity, whether that divinity is understood as the Judeo-Christian God, the Shavian Life Force, or the equivalent in some other belief system. Using the Christian sacrament of Baptism as a dispositive case in point, Shaw, always the cogent syllogist, argues that “if God is the Father of all men, and if the child is the father to man, it follows then that the true representative of God at the christening is the child itself.”
         
               Hence, from Shaw's considered viewpoint, if we seek the Kingdom of Heaven, we need not scour the galaxy frenetically. Instead, we should look no further than ourselves, for in each of us dwell effervescent particles of the same numen that breathes life into inert matter. In sum, for Shaw, every conception is immaculate,42
            
               and every child is a living incarnation of the primeval goodness that bathes the universe.43<br>
