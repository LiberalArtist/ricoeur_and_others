  The Pain of Poverty from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt7zw0w8">Women and Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Abstract: When I used to think of women anthropologists prominent during the last quarter of the twentieth century, either the profile would come to mind of a figure with arms akimbo ready to pounce on some ill-judged generalisation that I might have let slip, or alternatively a texture of silky meekness charged with static electricity and sheathing a healthy set of claws. The fault for these warped representations was, of course, entirely mine, and was no doubt due to schooling in competitive male boarding institutions where the opposite sex had been a reality only at the margins.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c5chgx">A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSEN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur’s work remains lamentably underappreciated a few years after this death. Several factors contribute to the relative neglect of his thought. First, Ricoeur is fastidious to a fault in acknowledging his intellectual debts, which can, deceptively, make his thought appear derivative. Second, the pattern of “detour and return” that characterizes his thinking can make it difficult to keep up with him. Following Ricoeur takes one through the diverse fields of existentialism, structuralism, psychoanalysis, and analytic philosophy, to name only a few of his better-known detours. How many philosophers read both Derrida and Parfit? Heidegger and Searle? Nevertheless, those willing<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgdwgd">Grace for the Injured Self</a><br>
  Author(s) Randall Robert L.<br>
  Abstract: Behind every psychological theory is a vision of human fulfillment. An image of optimal health is at work when we name something “neurotic,” “sick,” or “pathological.” We cannot speak of a deficit, a fault, or a sense of brokenness without an image of human health. Or as Paul Tillich used to frequently say, every perspective on the human condition conveys a sense of what is wrong with us, how we can find healing, and how we can sustain the reality of a new life.<br>

Chapter 1 set the stage in two ways for my argument. First, by tracing the fault lines in contemporary Bedan scholarship regarding his

Second, I teased out implicit historiographical, philosophical, and theological issues within that scholarly conversation germane to my point regarding the ability to understand Bede’s sense of history in light of the differences between modern approaches (e.g.<br>

  Abstract: Through no fault of his own, Michel Foucault missed out on May 1968. When the explosion erupted, he was hundreds of miles away teaching philosophy at the University of Tunis. Nonetheless, the May events had a profound effect on Foucault’s intellectual and political trajectory.

  Abstract: Each Tuesday during the Second Vatican Council, the Secretariat for Christian Unity held a meeting with the observers in the Unitas Residence on the via dell’Anima. There they explained and discussed the questions with which the conciliar assembly was currently dealing or that it expected to take up. Now the observers—Protestant, Orthodox, Anglican—frequently found fault with the conciliar texts for their lack of pneumatology. Account was taken of these critical comments, and Paul VI noted that there are 258 references to the Holy Spirit in the documents of Vatican II.² But is that all that is required to<br>

We could throw darts at A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man for evidence. Throughout chapter 3, and after, Stephen’s young conscience is haunted and enchanted by a preacher’s description of Satan’s sin: “an instant of rebellious pride of the intellect” (A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, 133), “the sin of pride, the sinful thought conceived in an instant: non serviam” (P, 117).

  Abstract: The term
                  confessionis defined as “the disclosing of something the knowledge of which by others is considered humiliating or prejudicial to the person confessing: a making known or acknowledging of one’s fault, wrong, crime, weakness, etc.” Although this definition encompasses matters of special importance in the traditions of both law and religion, it is the religious association that is relevant to the history of psychological healing. In that tradition, it has been considered “a religious act: the acknowledging of sin or sinfulness.” More specifically, it became “auricular confession”: that is, “addressed to the ear; told privately in the ear.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated research methods promise results from systematic investigations that are more psychoanalytically significant than those of past investigations. However, systematic investigation in psychoanalysis is unfortunately associated in many analysts’ minds, and also in the minds of many friends and foes of psychoanalysis, with a long history of fault finding. This attitude is epitomized in the criticisms of Eysenck (1952, 1966), Hook (1959), Grünbaum (1984, 1994), and Crews and colleagues (1995). Each of these authors asserts a rigidly positivistic view of science and shows that psychoanalysis<br>

  Abstract: V. Y. Mudimbe famously referred to Jean-Paul Sartre as ‘an African philosopher’ (
                  IoA, 83) and a ‘philosophe nègre’ (CB, 69). This unilateral africanisation of the Paris-born phenomenologist compels the reader to pause and think about the many fault lines but also intellectual and imaginary overlaps between Africa and Europe. Where does the former start and where does the latter stop? There are of course objective geographical facts and undeniable ethnic markers to corroborate the idea that Africa and Europe are distinct entities with neatly defined boundaries.

  Abstract: An acute sense of what Marjorie Perloff called “the poetics of indeterminacy” has marked criticism and scholarship for at least thirty years.¹ Synthetic narratives—historicist, dialectical, psychoanalytic—have seen their truth values turn imaginary, becoming what William Blake in

  Abstract: Ambiguity has long been recognized as a significant phenomenon of discourse, if too frequently as only an undesirable one. In these respects, and in terms of its logical significance, ambiguity provides a strong contrast to originality, the category with which I started. Yet if ambiguity has been commonly regarded as a fault, the nonambiguous has acquired neither proportionately laudatory connotations nor even adequately discrete delineation. The area of the unambiguous is one of virtue but not of cardinal virtue.

  Abstract: Nothing is more alien to the windless closure of high naturalism than the works of Joseph Conrad. Perhaps for that very reason, even after eighty years, his place is still unstable, undecidable, and his work unclassifiable, spilling out of high literature into light reading and romance, reclaiming great areas of diversion and distraction by the most demanding practice of style and
                  écriturealike, floating uncertainly somewhere in between Proust and Robert Louis Stevenson. Conrad marks, indeed, a strategic fault line in the emergence of contemporary narrative, a place from which the structure of twentieth-century literary and culturalinstitutionsbecomes visible<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Emphasis on institutional mediations provides for Ricoeur’s perspective on the issue of moral responsibility. He takes Hegel’s account of
      Sittlichkeitto have sufficiently answered the question that plagues Anglo‐American theorists of whether imputations of responsibility are compatible with universal determinism. What interest him are imputations of responsibility that dispense with agency and fault in part because of the solidaritySittlichkeitinvolves. There are risks that individuals take for which business enterprises or the political entity to which they belong takes responsibility and attributions of fault that refer to interconnections of consequences for which no one in particular is responsible. How do we balance, then, ideas of individual risk and responsibility against the virtues of solidarity? When are we responsible as individuals and when can we assume the solidarity of others in accepting a collective responsibility?<br>

Abstract: What some may think was the rhetoric of a young Turk trying to make his mark, or simply a critique growing out of U.S. historiography’s long antitheoretical tradition, I believe can instead be explained in three complementary ways. First, Bailyn was not alone in finding fault with the lack of integration in Braudel’s tripartite structure. In a 1957
         JMHarticle, “French Scholarship in Modern European History: New Developments since 1945,” Edward R. Tannenbaum characterized the debate as one between conventional and innovative history: “[Braudel’sLa Méditerranée] has stimulated an international controversy between conventional historians and those who want history to include the techniques of other disciplines in an all‐embracing synthesis.”34Hans Kellner, writing inHistory and Theory(1979), summarized the early criticism ofLa Méditerranéeas posing the question, “Was the work an enormous heap of diverse materials or a truly revolutionary step in historical methodology?”35<br>

Abstract: As the broad outline of Rubin’s argument suggests, race is not central to or an important part of rethinking sexual politics. If all references to race were entirely missing from Rubin’s essay, that omission alone would be enough to give us pause. After all, the history of the United States is replete with instances of repressive state apparatuses meting out punitive justice for crossing the racial‐sexual border. And as many African American feminists have pointed out, bourgeois white sexuality has always been constructed through its difference from aberrant black sexuality (see Carby
         1987, 20–39). But race is not an absent signifier in Rubin’s essay, and the point is not to fault Rubin for a lack of critical race awareness. Indeed, Rubin is very much aware of the ideological nexus of race and sexuality but chooses to treat race as peripheral to the articulation of a sexual politics. The problem, I will argue, is that, as in much feminist/gender theorizing today, race is incorporated in the essay through analogy and thus naturalized into an appendage of a more important discourse of sexuality.<br>

Abstract: The greatest fault line in the childhood studies literature, however, comes from the critique made of psychological models overall by what has been termed a “social sciences” approach that arose primarily in Europe in the late 1980s. Instead of examining individual children or family systems, this approach investigates children as they participate in and are constructed by their diverse cultures and societies. The origins of this methodology can be traced back to the historian Philippe Ariès, who famously argued in 1960 that experiences and interpretations of childhood have varied significantly across Western history (even if his narrower claim that childhood was invented only after the Middle Ages is generally rejected).
         11The seminal text in this new social sciences paradigm is the 1990 interdisciplinary volume, edited by the British sociologists Allison James and Alan Prout, titledConstructing and Reconstructing Childhood.12Here the argument is advanced that childhood—or rather “childhoods”—cannot be understood apart from how children interact with a range of diverse social variables such as poverty, class, gender, race, culture, and ethnicity. As James puts it elsewhere, “to see children as social actors is core to childhood studies. From that perspective, one sees children both as individuals who participate in a social world and as members of a social category defined by particular social, historical, and ideological processes.”13This new methodology has spawned a worldwide explosion in childhood studies across disciplines as varied as sociology, anthropology, law, medicine, cultural studies, media studies, education, economics, and public policy.14<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: In order to include, in a treatment of this limited page length, sufficient evidence from Smith’s virtually unknown adaptation of Genesis, I assume the reader’s general knowledge of the traditional biblical account and must generalize a Christian consensus regarding God’s sovereignty, human fault, and the origins of sin. I recognize that differences of opinion on these doctrines define many of Christianity’s distinctive denominations. For the purposes of this essay such differences may be treated as nuances in comparison to Smith’s contrary conclusions to certain generalizations shared by Roman, Orthodox, and Protestant Christians, namely, that (1) the world was created from nothing and constituted an expression of God’s absolute goodness; hence, (2) humans, as created beings, are ontologically unrelated to God and brought evil into being by their action.
         43The following section analyzes Smith’s redaction of Genesis as a subversion of these classic Christian propositions. The point of this analysis is, however, not to describe the subversion of meaning or the curious changes Smith makes in the Genesis story. Rather, Smith’s version of the story is told to illuminate the mode of his subversion: the manner in which he deploys myth to challenge or, in Lincoln’s terms, “recalibrate” the categories of thought and privileges inherent in the status quo of Christian theologizing on the divine‐human relationship.44Subsequent sections consider the relation of Smith’s narratives to Mormonism’s viability as a livable alternative to the ethos of traditional Christianity.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede-~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: We can do likewise with the sociopolitical logic of a burst of comic rather than lyric prose to follow at the wedding, where the ingenuity of lexical form again takes upon itself the role of softening its own content. The one character, Pancks by name, whose fate is not yet logged in or predictably tabled, must be commandeered by the wedding ritual. For this loose end is a true loose cannon, and his powder needs dampening. The pattern is not unfamiliar. The repeated self-division and self-doubling of characterization has already pictured for us the riven and nearly effaced hero, who was once to have shared honors with a satirized bureaucracy in the broad application of the novel's working title,
         Nobody's Fault. Clennam is a man haunted by his idiomatic doppelganger in the pronominal “nobody,” a self-cancelling ghost sprung from the vernacular substrate of the hero's own equivocated desire. The phantasmal negation first sneaks up on him in an unobtrusive fold of indirect discourse. Whose weakness could it possibly be to cloak a hopeless infatuation for a pretty younger woman like Pet Meagles? As Clennam protests too much in an extruded internal monologue, it is “nobody's, nobody's within his knowledge”—and this in the capping paragraph of the namesake chapter “Nobody's Weakness” (LD,p. 200). In nonentity's name, rather than his own, is he often identified from this point on. The novel also literalizes, materializes, elsewhere such psychic splits in, for instance, the “mermaid” bifurcation of Arthur's former heartthrob, Flora Finching, half sympathetic disappointed widow, half blithering romantic virgin. Most Dickensian of all, given its linguistic register, is the character constellation of the two Flintwinches, with thetwinat the punned-upon core of their shared surname offering a model for the way stylistics (here in the form of onomastics) can be angled toward a narratographic clue to the plot-long mystery involving their congenital rather than just uncan~<br>

Abstract: We can make one more pass over the terrain of witchcraft, however, to offer a specific cross-cultural example of how taking account of evil might contribute to an anthropological approach to morality. This reflection originates with the recent observation by Jenkins (
         2013) that in contemporary Zuni society witchcraft remains a problem, that moreover some witches are children, and that it appeared that the witches were becoming younger all the time. There is evidence that even in earlier times it was known that a Zuni child could decide to learn witchcraft (Ellis1989:196), but the idea that children might not only require protection from witchcraft but also be accused of it is disturbing. Unfortunately, the Zuni are not unique. The idea of child witchcraft appears to have been introduced to the subarctic Athabaskan Kaska around the turn of the twentieth century, whereupon a pattern of witch-killing ensued in which a child was blamed for someone’s serious illness and often “confessed to the crime which he did not understand” (Honigmann1989:29). Harsh punishment and execution of child witches was common among Arawak-speaking peoples of the Peruvian Amazon until around 1970 (following mass conversions to Christianity) but resurfaced in the 1990s in the context of intense political violence; the accused do not protest their innocence because they feel that the accusation itself constitutes proof regardless of their intentions or awareness of any occult powers (Santos-Granero2004). In the past several years an epidemic of child witchcraft in Africa has been reported both in the scholarly literature (de Boeck2005; Ranger2007) and in popular press reports from the Congo (Dowden2006; Harris2009) and the Niger Delta in Nigeria (Harrison2008; Houreld2009). Children are subjected to brutal exorcisms, abandoned to the streets, or murdered, often by pastors in the name of fundamentalist Christianity. Again, children “can be persuaded to accept it’s their fault. They tel~<br>

Abstract: I find Shakespeare’s play to be more exacting than this. If we apply a strictly reciprocal logic to the tragic action, it is difficult to fault Lear for hating the daughters who have betrayed him. Yet it seems clear to me that we are meant to wince when Lear savagely curses Goneril and then Regan. Their mistreatment of him does not condone his mistreatment of them. And truly, if the actions of the most virtuous characters in the play are to teach us anything, it is that commitment can have nothing to do with calculation or conditionality. The Fool, Kent, and Cordelia all give themselves to one who cannot be said to deserve their devotion, and their actions are approved for this very reason. If we are to give proper value to the play’s most meaningful characters and moments, we must acknowledge that what they have in common is an unqualified altruism quite apart from all thoughts of reciprocity and all systems of exchange. This, I believe, is the ethical standard to which the play holds us.<br>

Abstract: But the vast majority of critics have tended to absolve Eve of all guilt, insisting on the radical externality of those diabolic words. John Diekhoff reminds us that “Satan is not in the poem a metaphor for man’s evil impulses. He is the source of them and a real agent in Milton’s fable. The dream is not of Eve’s devising; it springs not from her unconscious but from Satan’s conscious.”
         
               Against those who claim that “Eve is the author of the dream,” Diana Benet insists that the dream “does not proceed from anything within herself; it takes its nature and particulars from its creator, bodying forth not Eve’s fault but Satan’s sin.”14
            
               Against the kind of reading that sees the dream voice as too familiar to be entirely external, Kristin Pruitt McColgan writes: “True, there is much in the sequence that is ‘familiar’: a tree, moonlight, Adam’s voice, angels. But the source is Satan, who supernaturally implants a vision in Eve’s mind in sleep.”15
            
               Such a reading is silently supported by the insertion of quotation marks—which visibly suggest that these words do in fact have an external origin, that there is a prior utterer whom innocent Eve is merely citing.16<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Paul’s situation—and, in a broader sense, the situation of every believer (or “apostle,” as Badiou calls the one who declares the event)—can be described as dominated by the rule of two related but distinguishable “regimes of discourse”: Jewish discourse and Greek discourse. The prophet who predicts through figures or signs is the figure of the Jewish discourse, whereas the philosopher who attempts to speak of eternal truths is the figure of the Greek one. Together with the specifically Christian (in a strict sense, Pauline) discourse of the evental declaration, they constitute three discourses whose subjective postures are: to demand—to question—to declare.
            
                  The fourth discourse (miraculous or mystical), according to Badiou, must remain unaddressed: it cannot enter into the realm of preaching, for it is “vain to want to justify a declaratory stance through the appeal of miracle.”89
               
                  The intersection of law (Jewish or Greek) with sin is considered by Badiou the central problem recurring in almost all the Pauline epistles. Sin is not conceived of in terms of individual fault but as “living thought’s inability to prescribe action.”90
               
                  If we were able to save ourselves, we would not be in sin. But since it is beyond our capabilities, an event (resurrection) must intervene in order for the oppressive automatism of the law to be interrupted.91
               
                  As Badiou contends, “Paul’s project is to show that a universal logic of salvation cannot be reconciled with any law, be it one that ties thought to the cosmos, or one that fixes the effects of an exceptional election.”92
               
                  However, Badiou goes further by stating that if the event were transcendent, as Paul maintains, it would be likely to simply duplicate the Jewish logic of divine exception and leave the measure of the law intact—hence his conclusion that the event must ~<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the relationship between poetics and politics in Martí's work. By way of an archeology of the political images in his poetry (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos, Versos libres) and, conversely, of the poetic representations that abound in his prose and oratory, the author argues for a tension between the two textual dimensions that is never quite resolved or diluted within a discursive or historical synthesis. And yet, the authorial schism is not exactly a fault to be "corrected" by critical reading, but rather the very axis of a martinian hermeneutics. Este ensayo explora las relaciones entre poética y política dentro de la escritura de José Martí. A través de una arqueología de las imágenes políticas que aparecen en su poesía (Ismaelillo, Versos sencillos y Versos libres) y, a la inversa, de las representaciones poéticas que abundan en la oratoria y la prosa de Martí, el autor sostiene que esos dos mundos del texto viven siempre en tensión, sin que ambas identidades textuales puedan diluirse en una síntesis discursiva o histórica. Sin embargo, la escisión de la autoría no es, aquí, una falla que el crítico debe "corregir", sino el eje de una hermenéutica del sujeto martiano.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, op.cit., p. 156. The tremendous difficulties we face in developing an
adequate view of evil are well illustrated by the fact that Ricoeur himself, despite his clear
intentions to the contrary, works with a view of human "fault" in Fallible Man (Chicago:
Henry, 1965) which itself comes very close to reading sin and evil into the fundamental
human structure. See the Master's thesis of Henry Venema, Philosophical Anthropology, and the

for Christian Studies, 1986).<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: L'infini de la volonté voulante n'exclut pas la finitude de l'homme; il l'accentue plutôt dans la mesure où l'homme est incapable de saturer son désir et de s'achever par lui-même. Cette finitude apparaît comme disproportion ontologique dans l'écart du savoir, du pouvoir et du faire, comme faillite de la volonté voulue dans l'expérience de la faute meurtrière. L'ultime tentative de l'autosuffisance humaine consiste à borner le désir et à l'investir dans un fini absolutisé, comme en témoignage l'action superstitieuse. Dans le cas de l'option positive, qui est de "vouloir l'infini" , peut-on concevoir l'achèvement de l'action comme "divinisation" de l'homme? Oui, a condition de ne pas en faire un donné de nature, ni un acquis de l'homme, mais un accueil du don surnaturel qui exige l'aveu de l'insuffisance. /// O infinito da vontade profunda "voulante" não exclui a finitude do homem; antes a acentua na medida em que o homem é incapaz de saturar o seu desejo e de se completar por si mesmo. Esta finitude aparece como desproporção ontológica no distanciamento do saber, do poder e do fazer, como falência (faillite) da vontade concreta "voulue" na experiência da falta mortífera. A ùltima tentativa da autosuficiência humana consiste em limitar o desejo e em investir num finito absolutizado, como o testemunha a acção supersticiosa. No caso da opção positiva, que é de "querer o infinito", pode conceber-se o acabamento da acção como "divinizacao" do homem? Sim, se não se fizer disso urn dado da natureza, nem uma aquisição do homem, mas urn acolhimento do dom sobrenatural que exige a confissão da insuficiência. /// The infinity of the "willing will" ("volonté voulante") does not exclude man's finiteness. It rather stresses it, by the fact that man is unable to completely satisfy his desire, and to fulfil himself on his own.

Publisher: Vereeniging voor Wijsgeerige Uitgaven<br>
Issue: i40039577<br>

Author(s): VERMEULEN E. E. G.<br>
Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: None of them has emerged from my mind, warmed over, artful and beautified; they have come like tears springing from the eyes or blood spurting out from a wound…. I did not stitch together bits of this and that, but cut deep into myself. These poems emerged written not in academic ink but in my own blood. Whatever I place on view here I once have seen (
            Ihave seen it: me), and I have seen much more, which fled before I could copy its features. From strangeness, singularity, haste, and hoarding, I wrest my visions, and any fault was my own, for I have made them rise up before me as I copy them. I am responsible for the copy. I found some garments that were torn and others that were whole, and I wore these colors. I know they are not worn out. I love difficult sonorities and sincerity, even when it may seem brutal. All that they have to say I know and have confirmed for myself. I have sought to be loyal, and if I sinned I feel no shame at having sinned.

Abstract: In the use of sounds, we also see a change between part one and two in order to assist the reader's longing back to his earlier textual memory. In the transitional fifth chapter, the summer rain subtly changes from soft and wonderful to a windy and loud thunder as the story progresses toward the ultimate fate of Gatsby's nostalgic dream. It is the zenith, the narrative breaking point, when the reader suddenly emotionally becomes aware of the impossibility of Gatsby's project. The “faint flow of thunder along the Sound” suggests this feeling of irrecoverable moments, a loss that even Gatsby seems to realize when “Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion” (95). Later, after Myrtle's death, the merry sounds of the summer birds have completely changed into singing “ghostly birds” (152). As Kundu has observed, “[t]he hiatus between beauty and the romance of nature and humanity's tragic fate” is established through the diverse use of sounds and descriptions of nature (101).<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>
