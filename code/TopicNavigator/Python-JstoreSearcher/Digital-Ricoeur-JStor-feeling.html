  Abstract: In a press conference two days after his election to a second term, President Bush assessed the import of his victory: “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.” President Bush interpreted the election results as a clear expression of public opinion. Through their votes, citizens indicated their support for his policy agenda: “After hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that—when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced<br>

  Abstract: In his classic sociology textbook published in 1909, Charles Horton Cooley assessed the relationship between democracy and religion. ʺThe democratic movement,ʺ he wrote, ʺinsomuch as it feels a common spirit in all men, is of the same nature as Christianity; and it is said with truth that while the world was never so careless as now of the mechanism of religion, it was never so Christian in feeling.ʺ Comparing the ʺhigher spirit of democracyʺ to the ʺteaching of Jesus Christ,ʺ Cooley claimed that Jesus ʺcalls the mind out of the narrow and transient self of sensual appetites and visible appurtenances,<br>

  Abstract: Born in the early 1950s in Poland, I grew up in a farmer’s family in a small rural village. Just like all the other villagers, I was socialized in the Catholic parish. I experienced the safety and security of the religious environment entirely from the perspective of unbroken childlike trust. As a fourteen-year-old, I went to the big city and moved into a Communist boarding school.

The Berlin Wall had fallen in November 1989, but there was already a widespread feeling of frustration concerning the newly conjoined Germanies. Many in both east and west wondered aloud whether things might be better if the wall were still standing. In the former East Germany, and in Berlin in particular, violence against foreigners had increased; there had been murders, and tensions had increased to the point that the federal border police had been called in to provide security on the Berlin subways.

  Abstract: The four distancing strategies discussed in the last chapter set fences around appropriate devotional feeling, but they also set the devotional community apart from persons suspected of inappropriate love for God. This dynamic is most clear with regard to rival religious groups. Bernard of Clairvaux projects perverse practices upon heretical groups, and later church officials view with profound suspicion unauthorized women who claim Christ as their lover. These moves anticipate the Fourth Lateran Council’s careful circumscription of the real presence and body of Christ to the institutional Church and its sacraments.¹ The rivalry of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas with other sects around<br>

  Abstract: Empathy and sympathy are feeling-acts that open unique modes of access to other persons. While they differ from one another in object and intentional structure, both bring other persons into proximity to the experiencing subject. This “bringing near” suggests that empathy and sympathy are misunderstood if they are interpreted as mental acts whose objects yield their meanings only when they are taken as traversing an intervening space, as originating at a remove from the act of apprehension. Sight and hearing are the paradigmatic senses for grasping objects that are given as coming from elsewhere. Visual objects are apprehended as coming<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

  Abstract: To end with a discussion of the work of Maurice Blanchot is rife with difficulties, two of which I will mention by way of beginning. The first involves the sheer difficulty of reading his work. While to be sure, this seems to be something of a “side issue,” it is one with important consequences: An encounter with Blanchot’s texts—whether those of his fiction, his criticism or the aphoristic, fragmentary texts of the later years—induces a deep feeling of exposure and vertigo, the negativity or indeterminacy of which is hardly conceivable as a mediating moment toward a higher reconciliation,<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Abstract: It was sheer serendipity that brought us together, but there we were. The original question was innocent enough: “How are we to understand hospitality?” Even when sharpened into “What can phenomenology tell us about welcoming the stranger?” it still seems to intend no harm. But when the “stranger” in question morphs into the “uncanny,” it takes on a weirdness that the uncanny itself suggests. For the layman, the word suggests a feeling of dread or inexplicable strangeness, seeming to have a preternatural cause, as if locked into the present by some ominous and long forgotten past.

  Book Title: Malicious Objects, Anger Management, and the Question of Modern Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kreienbrock Jörg<br>
  Abstract: Why do humans get angry with objects? Why is it that a malfunctioning computer, a broken tool, or a fallen glass causes an outbreak of fury? How is it possible to speak of an inanimate object's recalcitrance, obstinacy, or even malice? When things assume a will of their own and seem to act out against human desires and wishes rather than disappear into automatic, unconscious functionality, the breakdown is experienced not as something neutral but affectively--as rage or as outbursts of laughter. Such emotions are always psychosocial: public, rhetorically performed, and therefore irreducible to a "private" feeling. By investigating the minutest details of life among dysfunctional household items through the discourses of philosophy and science, as well as in literary works by Laurence Sterne, Jean Paul, Friedrich Theodor Vischer, and Heimito von Doderer, Kreienbrock reconsiders the modern bourgeois poetics that render things the way we know and suffer them.<br>

However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

  Abstract: Anyone working in a historical discipline experiences within himself, at certain times, a sympathetic reverberation of Stephen Dedalus’s cry that history is a nightmare from which he must awake. This feeling of suffocation steals over the philosopher when he attends to the long tradition of texts and studies in his field. Then, the history of philosophy seems to be an externally imposed and pressing structure, controlled entirely by lines of investigation laid out in the far distant past and extending into one’s present activity only in order to cramp and discourage the creative mind.

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Abstract: In his
                  Allgemeine theorie der schönen Künste, Johann Georg Sulzer does not confine the experience of the sublime to feelings of wonder, terror, respect, or elevation. The sublime is “the highest in art, and must be employed when the mind is to be attacked with powerful strokes, when admiration, awe, powerful longing, high courage, or also fear or terror are to be aroused.”¹ Powerful longing, excessive and aimless—this recalls James Usher’s mighty unknown want as a modality of the sublime feeling. Filtered by our readings of the pseudo-Longinus, Burke, and Kant, today’s outlook has obstructed this modality from view,<br>

  Author(s) Jackson Michael<br>
  Abstract: I have long admired Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s writing on Paul Cézanne because it provides insight into the artist’s practice beyond the general conventions of art history. The philosopher saw the painter as a paradigm example of the essence of perception.¹ As he writes, “Cézanne did not think he had to choose between feeling and thought, between order and chaos. He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

  Abstract: Samuel Johnson said that reading Shakespeare would help ‘a confessor predict the progress of the passions’.¹ Shakespeare’s works have always been a prime location of powerful and intense feeling, telling us that passion is not just an unavoidable but a positive aspect of human experience. ‘O, you are men of stones!’ cries Lear at the end of his play to those around him: there is something morally wrong with restraint of feeling at this dreadful moment.² Cold-heartedness, lack of feeling, a cool, detached perspective on life: all that is declared by Lear to be less-than-human.

I am fascinated with narratives, too.

  Abstract: This part reflects on the nature of music. It broadens its definition as a mere description in terms of a sounding structure by comparing it to language and speech. By stressing their roles in action and performance, both music and language in action establish social bonds that afford listeners and performers the feeling of a genuine and shared experience. The figure of the performer who acts as a mediator between music and audience is a crucial element in understanding the mutual relationship between theoretical approaches to music and its possible, actual performances.

Anthropologists and historians have come together here in order to recapture, elaborate, and criticize pre-Cultural Turn and non-Cultural Turn modes of analysing structures of experience, feeling, subjectivity and action in human societies and to highlight the still unexploited possibilities developed among others in the work of scholars such as Norbert Elias, Max Gluckman, Eric Wolf, E.P.

As a phenomenologist of affectivity, it is no surprise that Henry focused his attention on specific tonalities that reveal a privileged truth. Early in his career Henry emphasized despair as the privileged tonality, but later he dispensed with despair and instead preferred to speak of anxiety. Despite the change in vocabulary, however, in each case his interpretation of what the disclosive mood discloses is the same.¹ Beyond the sort of disclosure characteristic of any ordinary feeling, a disclosive mood, according to Henry, reveals the self<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: The Expression Theory is one of the distinctively modern approaches to art. “Art is the expression of emotion.” Of course earlier writers said a good deal about art and emotion. Plato described art as the feeding and watering of the passions. In the third century the Peri-Hypsous stressed the importance of vehement emotions in the literary work. Renaissance artists were much concerned with the faithful rendering of feeling states in the portrayal of their subjects. Eighteenth century artists and theorists had much to say about the sublime, the feeling of delicious terror. Hegel emphasized the insight art gives into the<br>

  Abstract: So typically romantic were those verses that few could have guessed that Hegel would be able to turn this hopeless feeling of the “poverty of words” into the bliss of Absolute knowledge. Indeed, Hegel’s philosophy appears to be no less than an initiatory ascent, confident that it can break the silence, and make us hear the Truth again, or perhaps even more, stare it in the face and dwell in its presence. We were left, at the end of the previous section with a rather nostalgic subject. A subject in desperate need for Revelation, “ready to receive it with joy”<br>

  Abstract: A primary developmental task for a child is to become emotionally bonded with a significant caregiver (e.g., mother) and then, in due course, to separate from her and to individuate and become his or her own person (Mahler, Pine, & Bergman, 1975). A failure to achieve this developmental task may mark the person’s relational pattern in that he or she may develop a fear of getting close to people or of feeling abandoned when pushed to pursue independence. A person with this pattern can also alternate between getting close to and taking distance from a significant person. This relational pattern—referred<br>

It embraces the corporeal in itself as its substance. It does not experience the multiple parts of the external body as divisions of the soul. Rather (like Aristotle’s sensus communis), it gathers them up into one experience. “[T]he ‘real’ outness of parts in the body has no truth for the sentient soul.”² The feeling soul in the body is “one simple, omnipresent unity.”³<br>

  Abstract: As the saying goes: the center does not hold. If one were to highlight a central feature of the modern age, one could plausibly point to its centrifugal momentum, its tendency toward fragmentation. In the intellectual domain, the tendency is patently evident in the process of specialization, the relentless segregation of fields of knowledge. However, the trend exceeds the knowledge domain. Together with other thinkers of his time, the philosopher Hegel saw modernity marked by radical “diremptions” or divisions (
                  Entzweiungen)—divisions between knowledge and action, thinking and feeling, private self-interest and the common good—with the prospects of reconciliation growing<br>

  Author(s) Mailloux Steven<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric and hermeneutics have rediscovered each other in our postmodern period. In classical modernity both had seen their range narrowed and their importance as intellectual disciplines denied. Modern rationality felt free to diminish, even dismiss, both rhetoric and hermeneutics because each resisted the famous separations enforced by modernity: thought from feeling (dissociation of sensibility); content from form; theory from practice. Rhetoric could be reduced to issues understood as separate from and unimportant to modern theory: first, practical reason and its topical thinking; second, the forms of thought and the tropes informing all reason; third, the reasonableness of emotions, feelings, moods,<br>

Despite the metafictional character of his de-naturing of traditional narratives, his ex-posing of the ideologies concealed behind Western myths, and his interrogation of the hidden structures of thought and feeling (Logos and Eros) in which writer and reader are enmeshed, Robbe-Grillet’s detecting project can itself be generated only from within the traditional frames of language, myth, and feeling.<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Abstract: The theoretical concept of melancholia has recently received heightened critical attention in the field of race and postcolonial studies. As an emotional reaction to the denial of the loss of a loved object, be it a person, a place, or an ideal, melancholia gives shape to a “constellation of affect” or a “structure of feeling” encompassing the individual and the collective, the psychic and the social (Eng and Kazanjian, 2003: 3). As such, it has emerged as a crucial touchstone for subjective as well as political formations. In particular, melancholia has been deployed to unravel the complex mechanisms of national<br>

For Unamuno, reason alone can provide only intellectual, not emotive or spiritual, fulfillment: “el más trágico problema de la filosofía es el de conciliar las necesidades intelectuales con las necesidades afectivas y con las volitivas”

  Book Title: The Melodrama of Mobility-Women, Talk, and Class in Contemporary South Korea<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ABELMANN NANCY<br>
  Abstract: How do people make sense of their world in the face of the breakneck speed of contemporary social change? Through the lives and narratives of eight women, The Melodrama of Mobility chronicles South Korea's experience of just such dizzyingly rapid development. Abelmann captures the mood, feeling, and language of a generation and an era while providing a rare window on the personal and social struggles of South Korean modernity. Drawing also from television soap operas and films, she argues that a melodramatic sensibility speaks to South Korea's transformation because it preserves the tension and ambivalence of daily life in unsettled times. The melodramatic mode helps people to wonder: Can individuals be blamed for their social fates? How should we live? Who can say who is good or bad? By combining the ethnographic tools of anthropology, an engagement with prevailing sociological questions, and a literary approach to personal narratives, The Melodrama of Mobility offers a rich portrait of the experience of compressed modernity in the non-West.<br>

  Abstract: What does it mean to live during wartime away from the battle zone? What is it like for citizens to go about daily routines while their country sends soldiers to kill and be killed across the globe? Timely and thought-provoking,

Looking back over two centuries, Mary Favret locates the origins of modern wartime in the Napoleonic era and describes how global military operations affected the British populace, as the nation's army and navy waged battles far from home for decades. She reveals that the literature and art produced in Britain during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries obsessively cultivated means for feeling as much as understanding such wars, and established forms still relevant today.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book is to examine the concept and the practice of stardom in the France of the 1950s and 1960s,¹ a period of French history that saw dramatic economic, social and cultural change. Our premise is that the ‘stars’ of a given historical period or moment capture their era for us in a range of ways: that the preoccupations, values, conflicts and contradictions of a particular culture, its ‘climate of feeling’, are vividly expressed through its celebrities. Stardom may be read as a symbolic portal into the nature of a culture, stars as that culture’s ultimate expression.<br>

  Abstract: Progressive lawyering literature stresses the importance of focusing on clients. The basis for client-centeredness is respect for clients, client autonomy, and decision making. Legal services lawyers and clients in this study reveal a complex foundation for a practice centered on the individual client: the often transformative nature of the client-lawyer relationship for both client and lawyer. This takes place when lawyer and client open themselves to each other, even within the limited context of their legal services relationship. Beyond the material assistance clients seek from NELS, empathy, respect, and a feeling of connection are deeply powerful and affirming for people<br>

  Abstract: FOR ANYONE, ARTIST OR NOT, the experience of exile is bound to be upsetting to their happiness and well-being (if such things really exist). It matters little whether such an uprooting is the result of voluntary emigration in search of a better world or forcible banishment from one’s homeland. The loss of points of reference, of the feeling of belonging, combined with an abrupt break in the continuity and evolution of a person’s life, are overwhelming and can lead to an acute sense of disorientation and chaos, especially if the person is a writer.<br>

  Abstract: Habermas defined the problem. Or, rather, his book on the public sphere did. Jürgen Habermas matured in the Marxist tradition of western Europe, specifically that associated with the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory (he once referred to himself, a bit ruefully, as feeling like ‘the last Marxist’).² By then (1989), Habermas as philosopher had moved far away from any recognizable Marxism to articulate a vision of an egalitarian order that rested upon the act of speech. His heresy was apparent early on. He wrote a postdoctoral thesis, rejected by his Marxist supervisors, that became

  Abstract: The adjective ‘unconscious’ designates a quality that can be found in psychical processes such as imagining, remembering, thinking, feeling, desiring, wishing and acting. The processes which exhibit this quality differ from those with the quality ‘conscious’ in that the former are not present in the current field of consciousness but nevertheless remain psychologically effective, indeed, often far more so than the processes which have the quality of being conscious. The substantive, the ‘unconscious’, expresses the fact that psychological phenomena are not confined in principle to conscious experiences but are profoundly shaped by unconscious forces.

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

In my attempt to recapture those moments of communitas, of spectacular yet subtle beauty and grace in the performances I chronicle here, I’ve been challenged to write in a way that in itself mirrors the alchemical combustions of those utopian performatives.

  Book Title: American Night-The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): WALD ALAN M.<br>
  Abstract: American Night, the final volume of an unprecedented trilogy, brings Alan Wald's multigenerational history of Communist writers to a poignant climax. Using new research to explore the intimate lives of novelists, poets, and critics during the Cold War, Wald reveals a radical community longing for the rebirth of the social vision of the 1930s and struggling with a loss of moral certainty as the Communist worldview was being called into question. The resulting literature, Wald shows, is a haunting record of fracture and struggle linked by common structures of feeling, ones more suggestive of the "negative dialectics" of Theodor Adorno than the traditional social realism of the Left.Establishing new points of contact among Kenneth Fearing, Ann Petry, Alexander Saxton, Richard Wright, Jo Sinclair, Thomas McGrath, and Carlos Bulosan, Wald argues that these writers were in dialogue with psychoanalysis, existentialism, and postwar modernism, often generating moods of piercing emotional acuity and cosmic dissent. He also recounts the contributions of lesser known cultural workers, with a unique accent on gays and lesbians, secular Jews, and people of color. The vexing ambiguities of an era Wald labels "late antifascism" serve to frame an impressive collective biography.<br>

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, and others, the intellectual historian Enzo Traverso explores the varying nature of left melancholy as it has manifested in a feeling of guilt for not sufficiently challenging authority, in a fear of surrendering in disarray and resignation, in mourning the human costs of the past, and in a sense of failure for not realizing utopian aspirations. Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

It was Hazelius’s desire that the Nordiska Museet be ‘of benefit to science and at the same time arouse and fuel feelings of patriotism’, as well as ‘contribute to the strengthening of national feeling generation after generation, infusing love of one’s country … among young and old’.¹ This was a nationalism not of politics,<br>

  Abstract: The death of Slobodan Milošević, on March 11, 2006, in the detention unit of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) put an abrupt end to yet another process dubbed as “the trial of the century.” Three days later the Trial Chamber took notice of the death of the accused, hence terminating the case IT-02-54 that dragged on for more than four years toward its anticlimactic end. Disappointment among the interested parties was as deep as the earlier feeling of success upon his bringing to justice. “I deeply regret the death of Slobodan Milošević. It deprives the victims<br>

Abstract: Later exegesis endowed the body of the blessed with the qualities of impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtility. All resurrected bodies will be incorruptible; but only those of the blessed will be impassible, feeling no pain or discomfort. Brightness will be their proper “glory,” and it will be proportionate to merit.
         51Agility, the capacity of moving with total freedom and celerity, represents the opposite of the terrestrial body’s weakness; it is consistent with the resurrected Christ’s capacity to pass through material objects. Subtility expresses the peculiar spirituality of a body governed by the soul but incapable, in turn, to affect it.<br>

Abstract: In sum, both Bourdieu and Hochschild examine individuals’ “structures of feeling” as they pertain to social inequality; they move quickly from the individual to the social structure, without asking enough about how participants communicate in groups together. On the face of it, the distinction seems only to be that their goals are different from ours. They link feelings and habits to
            socialstructures, while we, most immediately, link groups’ patterns of interaction to “culturestructures”—collective representations and group styles. Their project may seem to be more about power and politics; ours, simply “cultural.” But we propose that by understanding how people make meaning together in groups, researchers understand more about power, political change, or political quiescence. Analytically, in this article, we have separated culture structures from social‐structural inequality, even if empirically, inequality is almost always weighing heavily on interaction. Butaftermaking this analytic separation, an observer can understand class reproduction more clearly, in more detail. A study of “culture in interaction” offers a crucial complement to analyses of the reproduction of inequality in everyday group settings.<br>

Abstract: The second reason for adopting Kuhns notion is that it is intimately tied to the question of (in)commensurability. I found this idea appealing because I had been feeling for quite some time that, once we start digging deeper, we might find considerable disagreement among colleagues on what constitutes an appropriate way of studying language from an anthropological perspective. It was the hidden incommensurability that I found interesting and tried to make explicit. Pace Rumseys reading, I never suggested that we should be looking for one shared or
         Urparadigm or that differences could be easily reconciled. Perhaps my call for a dialogue at the end of the article was misplaced and potentially misleading. I should then qualify it by saying that the call was never meant as a call for an ecumenical outcome. I take dialogue to mean the possibility of understanding, which may imply the recognition (as well as the achievement) of either agreement or disagreement.<br>

Abstract: The body is the privileged instrument or, as Polanyi but also Merleau‐Ponty says, trying again to muddle the dichotomy between instruments and the body, instruments are also another part of the body. With Hawking, the body is not the privileged instrument, and the instruments are much more than another part of the body; they make the body present as much as they comprise it. As we have seen, this system enables him to mediate his relationship with his own human body by excorporating or making visible the normally invisible functioning or dysfunctioning of certain neuromotor operations. Owing to the computer’s mediation, Hawking can immediately allow the pain in his human body to be located, by writing
         legs,for example, on his computer. By activating the synthetic voice, he can mobilize the competences of his nurse so that she is immediately operational to remedy this dysfunctioning. The human body is thus taken care of by the nurse, through the computer, which serves to alert her and to pinpoint the problem. In this way, through these different mediations, the functioning of this human body becomes visible (for us as observers and for the nurse), externalized and collectivized to such an extent that, as long as the body is taken care of by the relay of machines, men, and women, Hawking no longer thinks about it (like when we swallow without thinking about it).51This sequence consists of a multitude of actions: feeling of pain in the human body,legsdisplayed on the computer,legsspoken by the computer, mobilization of the nurse, movement of Hawking’s leg, activation of his nurse’s arm, leg rested—all of which have become the movement of one and the same self‐repairing body. For Hawking, the movement of this natural, collectivized body has become invisible, as a body endowed with its own ability to move would be.52<br>

Abstract: Braudel, “Personal Testimony,” p. 449, records his university and postuniversity malaise: “a student of history … graduat[ing] without difficulty, but also without much real enjoyment. I had the feeling I was frittering away my life, having chosen the easy way out.” Before he was to find his “vocation as a historian,” he “taught a superficial history of events, … becoming what one may call a good teacher,” liking and being liked in turn by his students.<br>

Abstract: While giggles erupted from all corners of the room, I couldn’t help wondering if the constant assertion of God’s control over events didn’t in some way diminish these students’ sense of moral obligation to act in the world. After all, if all events follow God’s plan, regardless of what one chooses to do, why then act in ways that risk one’s safety?
            16Why “follow God’s law” if you can experience God’s history, and live and die within God’s embrace, feeling less pain than those who are not saved? If you’re saved through belief, then what propels ethical action? Mrs. Barrett herself had said that the Al Qaeda attackers had “seized the power that should have been given to God and didn’t allow God to work through the situation.” Was the Holocaust a situation that God “ought to work through” or one where people ought to intervene? Only one student, Kira, eventually volunteered that she would hide Jews, that she would choose God’s laws over the Gestapo’s, regardless of the risks to herself and her family.<br>

Abstract: My argument is that, in an analogous way to women’s and environmental studies, childhood studies should not only apply existing theological methods and norms but also challenge and transform them. It should do so in new and distinctive ways. In analogy to terms like feminism and environmentalism I call this approach “childism.” Christian ethics in particular has a long history of this kind of child‐centered self‐reflection: such as Jesus’s placing a child “in the midst” of his disciples to explain the kingdom of heaven, the early church fathers using childhood to describe the ideal human image of God, Augustine’s beginning his groundbreaking
      Confessionsthrough his original sin in infancy and youth, and Friedrich Schleiermacher’s exploration of the “feeling of absolute dependence” in relation to the notion of the child as gift.2The difference today is both a changed situation for children around the world and the possibility for greater empirical sophistication about the nature of childhood and its relations to families and society. The question for theological ethics is how to respond to the complex lives of children in the contemporary world in as sufficiently attentive and meaningful a way as to enrich, in turn, theological ethical understanding itself.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Abstract: What I wish to argue, then, is that just as in Bauman’s perspective, “the world becomes an infinite collection of possibilities[,] a container filled to the brim with a countless multitude of opportunities” (Bauman
         2000, 61), so does the past. Rather than singular and subject to interpretation, the past is something we conjure up for its own sake, for the pleasure of imagining “how we would have related, intellectually and with our bodies, to certain objects … if we had encountered them in their own historical everyday worlds” (Gumbrecht2004, 124). And as we do so, “we reject the question of what benefits we might expect from engaging the past,” for, as Gumbrecht points out, “any possible answer to the question of practical benefits will limit the range of modalities through which we can indulge in the past—and simply enjoy our contact with it” (125). In this light, re‐vision is no longer a matter of revisiting the past in order to project new futures, as Rich and Cixous had it, or of thinking that rewriting would have a demythologizing effect, as Carter thought it would (1983, 71). Rather, the retelling of well‐known stories from alternative points of view becomes part of the shopping, of “scanning the assortment of possibilities, examining, touching, feeling, handling the goods on display … putting some of them in the trolley and others back on the shelf” (Bauman2000, 73). For instance, Disney does not just issue the filmAladdin. Among the merchandising paraphernalia there is alsoDisney's Aladdin: The Genie’s Tale(Kreider1993) andDisney's Aladdin: Jasmine’s Story(Elder1997). These two books exemplify the way in which re‐vision has become an integral part of product marketing and a matter of personal choice. As bedtime approaches, parents turn to their offspring and ask: whose story do you want to hear tonight? Jasmine’s? The Genie’s? Aladdin’s? In fact, the manipulating of consumer goods Bauman speaks of happens quite literally in the Upside Down Tales se~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: The vengefulness of Pancks's fiery radicalism, flaring up just two chapters before the end of the book—and thus closer to being a climactic moment in the novel's social counterpoint than one may tend to remember—must somehow be quenched if society is to get on with the business of business as usual, as well as its own patrilineal continuance through marriage. There is no better place to perform this dousing, this ritual cleansing, than at a wedding. Narratology's work is regularly concluded in such a ceremonial event. Narratography alone would keep reading on. What it hears in this case is a stunning concision of phrase at this marriage of the businessman down on his luck and the poorhouse scion moving up—a wedding that requires Mr. Pancks to snuff out his recent asocial fury in order to attend. Such is the legally sanctioned ritual at whose margins he is (parenthetically and proleptically) so richly remunerated for his glancing witness. In the bourgeois novel, quiescence needn't be its own, or only, reward—at least when the system is fully up, oiled, and running. “Mr Pancks”—parenthesis—“(destined to be chief clerk to Doyce and Clennam, and afterwards partner in the house)”—and on the sentence goes, as if earning this fate in advance: Mr. Pancks, “
         sinking the Incendiary in the peaceful friend, looked in at the door to see it done” (LD,p. 785). The preceding run of phonetic irony is accompanied by its own graphic sinking from the capital I of “Incendiary” to the alphabetic as well as temperamental leveling of “friend.”20In its figural and alphabetic economy, that brief participial phrase is one of the great turns in all of Dickens, with its evoked soothing bath in the symbolic font of all fellow feeling. Overseen marital bonding, reduced to the “it” of pro forma social function (“to see it done”), is not only the antecedent but the prototype of those mercantile partnerships (here parenthetically foreordained) that are just as important as familial unions t~<br>

Abstract: The narrator of Proust’s aborted novel
         Contre Sainte‐Beuvepraises the binding of present sensation and past remembrance as endowed with “a sort of … reality” that is superior “to the realities of … intelligence, passion, and feeling.”45Bergson values the “harmony” between present sensation and its mnemonic equivalent because, in a mode of “attention to life,” it tells one how to handle present “circumstances” so as to optimize future ones.46On the contrary, Proust’s narrator declares that from the “impression” of this binding of past and present we may derive a nonutilitarian “pleasure”: a pleasure requiring that one disregard the spontaneous drives inherent in one’s attention and volition.47<br>

Abstract: Viewing grief and indignation as potentially virtuous seems odd given the tendency to construe virtue in positive terms, as ennobling or self‐enhancing. We typically associate the virtues with a good and genuinely happy life, and surely those positive features characterize the virtues.
         49But that fact should not prevent us from seeing how responses to loss and disconnection can also be expressions of moral excellence. Virtue, Aristotle writes, means feeling pleasure and pain in the right way. Schooled in the virtues, we should feel “at the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right people, with the right motive, and in the right way,” as he says of strong and noble character.50Casting similar ideas in Christian terms, Augustine writes, “Citizens of the Holy City of God, as they live by God’s standards in the pilgrimage of this present life, feel fear and desire, pain and gladness in conformity with the holy Scriptures and sound doctrine; and because their love is right, all these feelings are right in them.”51<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Now, Coleridge certainly does mention the Lord’s Prayer (e.g., N5383, N5721, N6095). Yet an equally persistent scriptural motif is Mark 9:24: “Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.” Thus, in 1808, Coleridge writes: “Now I feel the anguish of not feeling savingly the prayer—I believe! Lord help my unbelief” (N3353). In the mid‐1810s, once more he cites “the exceeding Difficulty, the absolute Necessity of prayer. … I believe! Lord! help my unbelief” (N4183). By the time of his more mature speculations, one might have thought this anguished topos had receded, only for it to recur decisively in an important note of March 1832. Having reiterated the themes already surveyed above—the responsibility to a personal God that constitutes us—he describes the difficulty of salvaging our proper moral being from the wreck of our apostate being: “Save me from the Disbelief of my fleshly Understanding!” (N6666, fol. 83). Predictably, a citation from Mark 9:24 follows. I am going to argue that the unusual prominence of Mark 9:24 can be attributed to a displacement in the concept of faith, a displacement identifiable by taking a detour through the work of Immanuel Kant.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Yet this secular turn would have been impossible, Sheehan suggests, without the catalyst of Pietism, a Lutheran reform movement with deep roots in the mystic tradition. Sheehan is certainly justified in identifying Pietist devotion with religious “individualism,” especially given its privileging of conscience, but such an emphasis obscures countervailing tendencies that called the self's cognitive faculties into question. Indeed, among early Pietism's influences was the notorious Madame Guyon, whose theology of self-annihilation had been the spark that set off the Quietist Affair.
         38According to Guyon, the self must “lose without ceasing its entire will in the will of God” and remain “indifferent to all things, whether for the body or the soul, for temporal possessions or eternal possessions.”39This is not to say that Sheehan is unaware of similar turns against spiritual agency. As he observes in his discussion of German Romanticism, Schleiermacher's “theology of feeling” repeatedly emphasized “an absolute dependence on God” (Sheehan, 229). Nevertheless,The Enlightenment Biblesituates these findings within an overarching narrative of the rise of cultural autonomy without considering the extent to which figures like Schleiermacher also represented an opposing shift toward dispossession.40Spinoza's praise of determinism, Guyon's arguments against spiritual self-ownership, and Schleiermacher's recognition of humanity's eternal indebtedness to God all contributed, in their various ways, to a radically immanent critique of transcendence, one that undermined autonomy on the basis of the persistent and immediate presence of the divine.<br>

Abstract: At a more intricate level, the metaphorical switch of the ritual actor might be deemed textural, not just structural. Structural metaphorical switches tend to translate between contemporary and ancient models based on some isomorphism of structure or similarity of relationship of parts (structural similarities), whereas textural transformations, according to Fernandez, tend to assimilate ritual actors to new personas based on similarity in feeling tone, contiguities in previous experience, or syntagmatic habit.
         86In this case a simulation of heroic mentality may have been produced by ritual acts such as reciting, praying, blowing Quranic verses into one’s possessions, purifying the body, and so on, which together induced a transformation irreducible to the sum of its parts. As Ricouer might see it, the metaphor was thickened and enriched by a spectrum of images, practices, and stories that attached themselves to the imaginative process when the ritual actor encountered the enacted metaphor, thus enhancing the paradoxical figuration of the 9/11 ritual actor as a seventh‐century holy warrior.<br>

Abstract: A few days following the announcement of Israel's independence, Blanchot wrote to Lévinas to ask after his reaction given that Lévinas had in earlier discussions emphasized his position that Zionism did not seem to be in accordance with Judaism's destiny. Lévinas responds by explaining his current ambivalence, one that is punctuated, on the one side, by a sense of the miraculous and, on the other, by the feeling that such an event reduces Judaism to the level of the mundane, to the “thirst of ministers, ambassadors, functionaries, and military officers who will finally have their protocols” (Lévinas, “Lettre à Maurice Blanchot sur la création de l'État d'Israël,”

Abstract: As Ricoeur elaborates it, “metaphor” as a semantic process has the power to transfer sentiments, so that in its poetic function, metaphor stretches the power of the double sense (sign and signified, vehicle and tenor, subject and predicate, or principal subject and modifier) from the cognitive to the affective.
         28Melandri also associates this approach with Max Black, who himself takes inspiration from I. A. Richards, who writes, “When we use a metaphor we have two thoughts of different things active together and supported by a single word, or phrase, whose meaning is a resultant of their interaction.”29He identifies this same conception as more brilliantly developed in Arthur Koestler'sThe Act of Creation, in which the metaphor's “bisociation” brings forth many other composite phenomena than those initially found in the analogy.30Of Dante and the Bible, Ricoeur writes, “Si la métaphore consiste à parler d'une chose dans les termes d'une autre, ne consiste-t-elle pas aussi à percevoir, penser ou sentir, a propos d'une chose, dans les termes d'une autre?” (If metaphor consists in speaking of a thing in the terms of another, does it not consist also in perceiving, thinking or feeling, about one thing in the terms of the other?)31In other words, metaphor offers us this “insight”—to perceive, think, feel, even perhaps be or become like another. It allows us to experience entrance into the other, in a sense capturing a rapturous condition of mankind beyond or before hierarchies, dichotomies, and binaries. Identifying this approach to metaphor with post-Cartesianism and Heidegger, Melandri, like Badiou, calls this the “sympathy” aspect of the hermeneutics of the analogy.32<br>

Abstract: Now, the Sirens have a still more terrifying weapon than their song, and that is their silence. And although, admittedly, it has never happened, it is conceivable that someone might have saved himself from their singing—but from their growing silent, certainly never. No earthly power could resist the feeling of having triumphed over them by one's own strength and the subsequent ecstatic excitement.<br>

Abstract: As an analytic category, evil needs to be understood in terms of qualitative distinctions between victims and perpetrators, social actors targeted as “motive” or “consequence” of the actions of others, active infliction of pain or passive suffering of afflictions. However, as the cases of child witchcraft considered by Csordas demonstrate, the practical logic of evil may blur or twist the clear positioning of “victim” and “perpetrator” when the “sign of affliction” is transposed into a “sign of evil.” Do witchcraft and sorcery thus provide a kind of key for theorizing the role of evil as situated human activity more generally, as Csordas suggests? Or is the practical logic of evil also discernible in violent human encounters framed in other moral terms? Such as, for example, in the recent revelations about the activities of a Neo-Nazi group in Germany responsible for the brutal killings of nine men with a Turkish immigrant background, all of them owners of a family business, over the last decade? One of the reasons for the apparent incapacity of the German police to solve the case for years does indeed seem to depend on the twisted logic turning the signs of affliction into signs of (potential) evil. The police categorically excluded the possibility of right-wing xenophobic motives from the start and assumed instead that the murders must be either motivated by cultural sentiments (honor killings) or by crimes attributed predominantly to “foreigners” (drug and human trafficking). A book written by the daughter of one of the victims vividly describes the destructive effects of how being suspected as a perpetrator when one experiences loss, damage, and suffering because of—in this instance—racial hatred generate illness on a personal level, suspicion and distrust on the collective one, as well as an overall feeling of injustice. The case is, of course, more complex than I could allude to it here.<br>

Abstract: On the subject of sympathy versus awe, Jean’s Marsden’s work is suggestive. She observes that an English obsession with sympathy in the second half of the eighteenth century led to extensive revisions of
         Lear. “Here we can find,” Marsden writes, “an attempt to bring Shakespeare into the realm of sympathy, to recast his tragedies in a form that inspired not awe but ‘fellow-feeling’” (Jean Marsden, “Shakespeare and Sympathy,” inShakespeare and the Eighteenth Century, ed. Peter Sabor and Paul Yachnin [Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008], 29).<br>

Abstract: There is a clear difference between philosophy and history, and it is epistemological. In his last book, dedicated to “special and selected deities,” Varro dealt with those gods who were defined by Roman places of worship and statues but had also to admit the limits of his interpretations:
         
               
            de diis…populi Romani publicis, quibus aedes dedicaverunt eosque pluribus signis ornatos notaverunt, in hoc libro scribam, sed ut Xenophanes Colophonios scribit, quid putem, non quid contendam, ponam. hominis est enim haec opinari, dei scire.
            
                     
               61
                  
               The history of an old people, as indicated in fragment 12, had a more binding authority ([I will write in this book about the public deities of the Roman people, to whom they have dedicated temples and whom they have marked out by many images, but, as Xenophanes from Colophon wrote, I say what I believe, not what I claim. A human can only surmise these things, only a god knows them for sure.]
            quoniam in vetere populo esset, acceptam ab antiquis nominum et cognominum historiam tenere, ut tradita est, debere se). But history’s authority did not imply intellectual consent. The very special, and nevertheless binding, history of the urban territory and the society built in that place contained wrong decisions by the old Romans—and maybe by contemporaries. Varro does refer to contemporaneous conflicts, as the Egyptian cults and the “leveling of temples” demonstrate. Narrating such events in such a manner offers the possibility of distancing. Varro supports Roman religious tradition despite crucial historical mistakes by its agents, right at the start as well as later on in the introducing of images. Such a traditional religion might even be embarrassing, for example, in their use of images as in the old Romans’ invention of divine genealogies, that is, mythical narratives of sexual relationships among gods (frag. ~<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: In the cosmos of
         Paradise Lostthere is perhaps no stranger fact than this—that the Son at his greatest moment in the poem says almost exactly the same thing as Adam at his worst. I say “almost” because it is of course the minor differences that make all the difference in Milton’s world. The Son is able to imagine the manner in which Satan might react to the fall of man, but unlike Adam, he refuses to give voice to that possibility. He chooses not to speak for the devil. Adam, however, relishes the opportunity to speak the words of another as his own. As in the cases of Eve and Raphael, the dramatic potential of this moment is too often unrecognized. How does Adam look and sound when he suddenly begins to act in the role of archfiend? Does he exclaim like a Roman orator and make elaborate gestures? Does he extend an index finger toward his chest when he says “Me first / He ruined,” feeling perhaps the thrill of being not entirely himself? But again, if Satan will never be able to say these words, then the “me” Adam points to can in the end be no one but himself. It is hardly surprising that in the very next line he consents to the formal act of sin, telling Eve: “I with thee have fixed my lot” (9.952).<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: For at least one audience member of
      King Lear, however, viewing the play in the theater is itself a traumatic event that inhibits the interpretation necessary for assimilating the pain and violence into a unified tragic vision. In his lectures on Shakespeare’s tragedies, A. C. Bradley, perhaps in spite of himself and his sensibilities, is particularly interested in tragic pain—or, more precisely, he is interested in tragic suffering and the way the physical pain depicted on stage gets in the way of this more lofty ideal. Bradley repeatedly comments on the excessive or intolerable nature of the pain represented in Shakespeare’s plays, but there are methods of analysis that make some instances of pain more “bearable”: “if we fully imagine the inward tragedy in the souls of the persons as we read, the more obvious and almost physical sensations of pain or horror do not appear in their own likeness, and only serve to intensify the tragic feelings in which they are absorbed.”
            Here Bradley shifts the audience’s imaginative focus to the “inward” rather than the physical pain of the characters, espousing a classic view of tragedy that places bodily pain in service to something else—a different, purer sort of “tragic feeling.” The means of accessing the tragedy makes a significant difference to Bradley, as is abundantly clear in his analysis of40
         King Lear. This play, he states, “is imperfectly dramatic, and there is something in its very essence which is at war with the senses, and demands a purely imaginative realization.”
            Watching and listening to41
         King Learin the theater is, for Bradley, counterproductive; the realization of the characters and their actions on stage actually inhibits the stirring of “tragic feelings” he takes to be Shakespeare’s goal.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: hsns.2012.42.issue-5<br>
Date: 11 2012<br>
Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: See Ortenberg, "Drawing Practices," esp. chap. 4, for a discussion of how many working drawings of ca. 1900 were produced for purposes of aesthetics, pedagogy, and etiquette. The dissertation's theoretical framework is influenced by the notion of ideology as developed by French philosopher Paul Ricoeur, whose
               Lectures on Ideology and Utopia(New York: Columbia University Press, 1986) argues that ideology performs a number of roles, from preserving the status quo to giving the feeling of purpose in everyday life and inspiring agents to strive for excellence.<br>

Abstract: The political vicissitudes endured by Leopoldo Lugones through both his attitudes and writings are described in this paper. On the one hand, his initial political Utopia reflected in the American post-romanticism, with a leader as Ruben Dario, progressive for the period. As of 1910, the political situation of an Argentina with masses largely integrated by foreingners, and with the social burdens they carry have turned him towards a feeling of the reality of his country, which is dominated by English imperialism. In 1938, faced with the impossibility of changing this reality, Lugones commits suicide. /// Las vicisitudes políticas sufridas por Leopoldo Lugones a través de sus actitudes y escritos se describen en este trabajo.

Publisher: Brill<br>

Author(s): Scott Bede<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis initiated by colonial modernity in Naguib Mahfouz's 1947 novel Midaq Alley. I begin by discussing the significance of anger within the narrative, arguing that this dominant structure of feeling could be read as a collective response to wider social and historical forces. In other words, rather than understanding emotion as the "subjective property" of the individual, I regard it here as a relational practice embedded within and determined by quite specific sociocultural circumstances. I then proceed to discuss the role of rumour in the novel and the significance of its pronounced melodramatic qualities. In the first case, I shall argue, the circulation of rumour provides a way of containing or quarantining the negative feelings produced by modernity, while also reinforcing the boundaries of a community facing the very real possibility of its own demise. In the second case, I would like to suggest that the narrative's tendency to privilege the melodramatic mode creates a sense of social order and moral intelligibility by channelling these feelings into a stable and predictable generic structure. This latter project is ultimately frustrated, however, when the forces of evil emerge to destroy the novel's principle representative of virtue.<br>

Abstract: Cet essai combine des souvenirs d'une enfance macédonienne et des réflexions sur cette nostalgie particulière, cultivée à travers la littérature et la musique, qui définit l'identité culturelle balkanique. Le sentiment de « sevdah », inspiré par la littérature et ancré dans l'histoire particulière de l'auteur avec son origine multi-ethnique et son émigration, sert de trame à l'évocation poétique d'un mode de vie et d'un parler désormais disparu, celui de l'ancien Bitola avec son héritage ottoman. This essay combines memories of a Macedonian childhood and reflections on a particular feeling of nostalgia, cultivated through literature and music, and which defines the cultural identity of Balkan peoples. The « sevdah » mood, inspired by literature and rooted in the author's particular multi-ethnic background and her history of emigration, is used to evoke poetic memories of old Bitola and its language marked by Turkish heritage.<br>

Abstract: Monter, pp. 83-84 : "Consider the example of one such pseudo-saint, Angela Mellini, tried by
the Bologna Inquisition in 1698. An illiterate seamstress in her mid-thirties, she had joined the
Ursulines, the lay sisterhood which taught reading poor girls. More to the point, Mellini was an
autonomous woman who kept changing confessors until she found one to her liking and
subsequently enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with him. After a few years, she had managed her
spiritual exercise of prolonged meditation well enough to have numerous visions, including one at
Christmas time, in which the Virgin handed her the newborn Christ-child and Mellini began to
nurse him feeling considerable physical sensations. She had also avowed her sexual desires toward
her confessor; he answered by describing his own sexual desires toward other women and begged
her to pray for him to keep him continent. After about a year he taught her to write so that she
could keep a spiritual diary (which survives). Whenever she confessed, which was often, because
she took communion several times a week, they would bless each other, in Latin. He had taken to
calling her madre, even mama.... This was clearly not 'spiritual guidance' as the Council of
Trent understood it. One of Mellini's friends and co-workers finally denounced her to the
Inquisition."<br>

Abstract: The appropriation of transnational cultural flows that occurs as a result of globalization is studied here through adaptations of Western narratives in manga and anime. This "Other" is integrated by exacerbating some of its features: The West is presented in Japanese works as conveyor of an excessive, unjust and potentially dangerous world, as the manifestation of Cartesianism taken to the extreme. Japaneseness, which is then defined by opposition to this incorporated otherness, brings out a supposedly specifically Japanese sensitivity, thus perpetuating a long intellectual tradition that sees in the feeling of things the very essence of Japaneseness by contrast to the rational Chinese and Western mind. Episodes from the life of Joan of Arc and Athena's divine interventions for instance then take on new meaning, which serves to promote Japaneseness and the essential values it conveys, such as the importance of social harmony and the close interdependence among members of the community.<br>

Abstract: The term 'animal' appears in NC II, 114 (note): Ί have argued that the act-structure of
inner human experience is founded in a lower structure qualified by feeling-drives in which
the psychical aspect has not yet opened its anticipatory spheres.... This animal structure is
bound by the higher act-structure of human experience' (italics mine). Nevertheless, it should
be clear that Dooyeweerd here points to the psychical substructure in the narrower sense, apart
from the typically human disclosure of this structure through anticipating subject-object
relations.<br>

Author(s): Richter Pál<br>
Abstract: The Schumann's sonata form (or sonata form-like) compositions little can be explained from the standpoint of tradition. Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, thematic action develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts to the end of the coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs "traditional" formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments.<br>

Publisher: Imprint Academic<br>

Author(s): Chowers Eyal<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that Freud's theory pictures modern selves as coping with a new existential and social predicament: a sense of homelessness within their own home. More specifically, Freud suggests that individuals feel estranged from parts of their own psyche (their super-egos) as well as feeling distant from their own culture and tradition (as they are represented by this psychic agency); in modernity, neither one's mind nor one's community can promise any longer a sense of ground. Because of this sense of perpetual and irrevocable displacement, Freud feared that modern selves might become semi-psychotic, selves lacking an inner social-normative voice. He calls on moderns, however, to overcome this bleak prospect and the related danger of political chaos by accepting the social norms imposed by their super-egos. But Freud champions only a conditional acceptance of tradition, one that involves ongoing scepticism, ambivalence and emotional distance. Freud's position could therefore be characterized as a unique type of communitarianism: it seeks a balance between admission of the constitutive force of tradition on the one hand, and the formation of an emotional detachment from its myths, practices and normative claims on the other.<br>

Abstract: El texto póstumo de Maurice Halbwachs, titulado "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presenta un triple interés entre otros. 1) Al descubrir la obligación social de sentir y la influencia de los grupos sociales, Maurice Halbwachs se convierte a la vez en digno sucesor de Durkheim, cercano colaborador de Marcel Mauss y también fino lector de Weber y de Simmel. 2) Al tratar la cuestión de la transmisión de las emociones, el autor reencuentra los problemas de la mémoire collective, eje de su obra, y trata la cuestión de la emoción en una temporalidad que afecta a la misma existencia y, más allá, a la transmisión intergeneracional. 3) Al insistir sobre la formalidad y la eficacia de las prácticas rituales para comprender "la expresión de las emociones", Maurice Halbwachs ofrece finalmente las vías de una posible superación de las oposiciones clásicas entre ritos y emociones o entre expresión y representación. /// The posthumous text by Maurice Halbwachs, "L'expression des émotions et la société" (1947), presents more than a triple interest. 1) When discovering the social obligation of feeling and the influence of social groups, Maurice Halbwachs becomesat the same time a worthy Durkheim successor, a close Marcel Mauss collaborator and a fine Weber and de Simmel reader. 2) Dealing with the question of transmission of emotions, the author reviews again the problems of la mémoire collective, axis of his work, and approaches the question of emotion in a temporality affecting existence itself and, beyond, the intergenerational transmission. 3) When insisting on the formality and efficiency of ritual practices to comprehend "the expression of emotions", Maurice Halbwachs offers at last the ways of a possible superation of the classical oppositions between rites and emotions or between expression and representation.<br>

Abstract: En analysant l'épisode de la lettre à Johnson publiée en avril 1966 par "Témoignage chrétien" et "Cité nouvelle," Sabine Rousseau décrit les mécanismes d'une mobilisation, alors pionnière, contre la guerre du Vietnam. Au lendemain de Vatican II, l'enracinement chrétien confère à cet engagement une forme originale, caractéristique d'un tiers-mondisme fondé moins sur les théories de l'impérialisme que sur le sentiment de la responsabilité chrétienne dans le drame vietnamien. /// The publication in "Cité nouvelle" and "Témoignage chrétien," on 21 April 1966, of an appeal to President Johnson marked the French Protestant and Catholic left's entry in the fight against the Vietnam war. Although somewhat late in their mobilization with respect to the Peace Movement, the commitment was early enough considering the dominant silence outside communist and communist sympathizer circles. As a sequel to the struggle for decolonization, this commitment took the original form of a letter to the president of the US. The feeling of Christian responsibility for the history of imperialism overtook the political analysis of the war. After a difficult beginning, the public opinion campaign grew during the summer, favored by the escalation of violence in Vietnam. But to the most committed left Christian militants, the campaign seemed already insufficient. Their radicalization in the fall of 1966 prepared for a mobilization in which the specific Christian commitment gave way to common action with the anti-imperialist movements.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo expone los principales resultados de una investigación realizada con el objeto de analizar el papel que cumplen las emociones colectivas en el mantenimiento del orden social. En concreto, trata de explicar el hecho de que las noticias más importantes que aparecen en los medios de comunicación sean noticias de horror, es decir, noticias en las que la muerte siempre aparece en el primer plano de la escena. Los informativos de los medios de comunicación expresan y fomentan la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. Ahora bien, para entender esta cultura es preciso determinar previamente la naturaleza emocional del horror, así como establecer una definición sociológica de este sentimiento. El horror es una emoción compleja compuesta por sentimientos de terror, de asco y de conmoción. El horror, sociológicamente, puede entenderse como "la emoción mediante la que un orden social señala sus límites más extremos". El estudio concluye señalando que existen dos modos alternativos de mantener el orden y la cohesión en el seno de un sistema social. El primer modo de legitimación, característico de las sociedades centrípetas, funciona mediante la gran potencia atractiva que ejerce sobre el campo social un núcleo central de valores sociales positivos. El segundo, característico de las sociedades centrífugas, funciona mediante la gran potencia repulsiva que ejercen sobre el campo social las transgresiones flagrantes del orden moral. El modo típico en el que las sociedades centrífugas regulan el orden social explica la cultura del horror característica de nuestras sociedades avanzadas. /// This article sets out the main results obtained from a research study carried out for the purpose of analysing the role that collective emotions play in maintaining social order.

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Author(s): Vieillard-Baron Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: Divers ouvrages sur saint Augustin conduisent à reposer la question du temps et celle du sujet qui ont alors été réunies pour la première fois comme un unique problème : memoria, conscience et conscience de soi, sont pensées selon le temps comme un sentir primordial. Celui-ci suppose un lieu, le ciel des ciels, qui est le lieu temporel de l'homme auprès de Dieu. L'intériorité augustinienne a des antécédents dans la pensée antique ; elle a influencé la philosophie récente ; Heidegger interprète l'ego de Descartes d'une façon augustinienne dans son herméneutique de la facticité. Les questions suscitées par ces ouvrages viennent du manque actuel d'une histoire spéculative de l'ego, en même temps que d'une résurgence évidente de celui-ci dans le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Several books about Augustine lead to question once more the topic of time and of the subject which then were united for the first time as a single problem : memoria, conscionsness and self conscionsness are thought according to time as a prime feeling. The latter supposes a place, heaven in heaven, which is the temporal seat of man next to God. Augustinian interiority has its antecedents within classical thought. It influenced recent philosophy. Heidegger interprets Descartes' ego in an Augustinian way within his hermeneutics of facticity. The topics at stake from these books surge from the present lack of a speculative history of the ego, together with an obvious resurgence of the latter within the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry-based teacher education promotes an exploration of concrete particulars as the route to wise practice. The case study presented illustrates one teacher candidate's struggle to let go of a conception of knowledge as generalizable formulae that can be readily applied in practice and to become more open to practice itself as a site of learning. Teacher educators can nurture such openness by helping aspiring teachers to appreciate the fragility of knowledge, the epistemological value of feeling, and the priority of the particular, in teaching. In so doing, educators recover practical wisdom as the beginning and end-in-view of teacher education. /// La formation à l'enseignement axée sur la recherche favorise la prise en compte des conditions particulières et, de ce fait, une pratique éclairée. L'étude de cas présentée dans cet article illustre les efforts d'une candidate à l'enseignement en vue de se départir d'une conception de la connaissance définie comme une formule généralisable, facilement applicable dans la pratique, et de mieux accueillir la pratique elle-même comme un lieu d'apprentissage. Les responsables de la formation à l'enseignement peuvent contribuer à cette ouverture en aidant les futurs enseignants à saisir la fragilité de la connaissance, la valeur épistémologique des sentiments et l'importance des conditions particulières dans l'enseignement. Ce faisant, les éducateurs redécouvrent la sagesse comme le début et l'objectif à atteindre dans la formation à l'enseignement.<br>

Abstract: La xénophobie exercée à l'encontre de la communauté d'origine asiatique sur l'île de La Réunion a été exacerbée durant la Grande Guerre (1914-1918). L'analyse d'une émotion populaire en novembre 1915, sur la commune de Saint-Joseph, permet d'appréhender les sentiments d'une population en proie aux difficultés économiques et sociales. L'Asiatique devient le « Boche » , l'ennemi commun selon un inconscient collectif. In the course of the First World War, in the island of Reunion, an increase was seen in the xenophobia shown toward the Asian community. An analysis of public opinion in the township of St Joseph in November 1915 reveals the ill feeling of a population beset by social and economic difficulties. Asians became known as « Huns » , a collective subconscious turning them into the common enemy.<br>

Author(s): PHILLIPS MARK SALBER<br>
Abstract: In common usage, historical distance refers to a position of detached observation made possible by the passage of time. Understood in these terms, distance has long been regarded as essential to modern historical practice, but this conception narrows the idea of distance and burdens it with a regulatory purpose. I argue that distance needs to be reconceived in terms of the wider set of engagements that mediate our relations to the past, as well as the full spectrum of distance-positions from near to far. Re-imagined in these terms, distance sheds its prescriptiveness and becomes a valuable heuristic for examining the history of historical representation. When distance is studied in relation to the range of mediations entailed in historical representation, it becomes evident that the plasticities of distance/proximity are by no means limited to gradients of time; rather, temporality is bound up with other distances that come from our need to engage with the historical past as (simultaneously) a realm of making, oí feeling, of doing, and of understanding. Thus for every historical work, we need to consider at least four basic dimensions of representation as they relate to the problem of mediating distance: 1. the genres, media, and vocabularies that shape the history's formal structures of representation; 2. the affective claims made by the historical account, including the emotional experiences it promises or withholds; 3. the work's implications for action, whether of a political or moral nature; and 4. the modes of understanding on which the history's intelligibility depends. These overlapping, but distinctive, distances—formal, affective, ideological, and conceptual—provide an analytic framework for examining changing modes of historical representation.<br>

Abstract: À La Réunion, l'école de la Troisième République s'est investie dans un processus d'acculturation nationale où les valeurs patriotiques et civiques ont été mises à l'honneur. L'affermissement du sentiment d'appartenance nationale s'est donc inscrit progressivement dans un patrio-bellicisme et dans une reconnaissance des bienfaits de la Nation pour les jeunes élèves de la colonie. Le lycée de Saint-Denis, établissement modèle accueillant les élites réunionnaises, a été l'objet à cet égard d'une attention particulière de la part des autorités coloniales. Durant la remise des prix effectuée chaque année avant les vacances scolaires, les élèves recevaient ainsi une dernière leçon édifiante d'instruction civique rappelant les fondements de la Nation et les devoirs inhérents au patriotisme. In Reunion Island, the School system of the Third Republic initiated a process of national cultural integration in which patriotic and civic values were promoted. As a result, the strengthened feeling of national belonging gradually developed into a patriotic/warmongering spirit and the recognition of the benefits brought by the nation in the minds of the young students of the colony. The Saint-Denis upper secondary school, a model school in which the colony elite studied, was therefore the object of particular attention from colonial authorities. Thus, during the prize ceremony held each year before the holiday break, pupils were taught a final lesson of civic responsibility with a reminder of the foundations of the nation and the duties inherent to patriotism. Auf der Insel Réunion, hat die Schule der Dritten Republik ein nationaler Akkulturationsprozess entwickelt, der die staatlich-patriotischen Werte in den Vordergrund brach. Die Befestigung des nationalen Zugehörigkeitsgefühls fällt dadurch schrittweise in einen kriegerischen Patriotismus und in die Erkennung der Wohltaten der Nation zugunsten der jungen Schüler der Kolonie.

Abstract: Ludivine Bantigny revisite les événements de 1968 au prisme de l'historicité. Soulignant combien le temps fut alors objet de luttes et de concurrences politiques, elle nous fait revivre l'intensité du présent, ce sentiment d'accélération tant individuel que collectif qu'éprouverent les protagonistes, la présence du passé, celui des révolutions, de la Commune ou des gréves de 1936, et un horizon qui s'ouvrait sur maints possibles. Cet article entend revisiter l'événement Mai-Juin 68 à l'aune de la conscience historique qu'en ont ses différents acteurs et du rapport aux temporalités imbriquées qu'ils entretiennent alors. Il évoque l'attention particulière prêtée au temps vécu comme un «temps de qualité», entre sentiment de l'urgence et impression de vivre un moment suspendu. Pour autant, ces temporalités elles-mêmes sont replacées dans la conscience que l'histoire est en train de se faire et qu'elle nécessite de réfléchir à cette condition historique, où le passé est un héritage pour mieux penser l'avenir. De fait, les références historiques mobilisées ici n'ont rien de figé; elles signent bien plutôt un rendez-vous de l'histoire et de l'événement, ce qui en fait un passé vivant. This article revisits May-June 1968 in terms of the various players' historical consciousness of the event and their relationship to the interwoven temporalities they had. It deals with the particular attention given to lived time as "quality time", between a feeling of urgency and the impression of living a suspended moment. Nevertheless, these very temporalities are part of the consciousness that history is going through, and it is necessary to think about this historical condition in which the past is an inheritance that makes thinking the future better. Indeed, the historical references used here are not cut and dried: they mark an appointment with history and with the event, which makes it a living past.<br>

Abstract: Le revival, qui se développa parmi les premiers disciples de Husserl, est un fait saisissant. Des documents, dont quelques uns sont encore inédits, servent à l'illustrer. Ce qui le fonde, c'est une étrange correspondance entre le projet de la première phénoménologie et les démarches subjectives de la conscience religieuse. La vraie philosophie, sainteté de la raison, n'est-elle pas aussi rectitude de la conscience jusqu'aux racines d'une expérience du sacré ou du divin ? The revival, which appeared among the first disciples of Ed. Husserl, is a well known fact. New documents are dedicated to illustrate such an event. They make clearer the existence of some mysterious bond linking the first phenomenological method and the basic disposition of natural religion. Genuine philosophy is indeed rightness of thought but also practical truth down to the very sources of a renovating feeling of the holy or the divine.<br>

Abstract: Les deux courants de pensée politique arabe au Proche-Orient les plus marquants depuis la guerre des Six jours sont, d'une part, les théories palestiniennes de la révolution arabe, et, d'autre part, l'islamisation du socialisme arabe hérité de Nasser. Les textes fondamentaux du FPLP et du FDPLP, mais aussi les études, plus modérées, d'intellectuels proches du Fath et de l'OLP redonnent vie à des sensibilités politiques proche-orientales caractéristiques. En effet, la « révolution palestinienne » est vue expressément à la fois comme locale, provinciale, d'une part, et, d'autre part, comme nationale-arabe, et non comme étatique. Quant au socialisme arabe en quête d'islamisation, il bénéficie de la pensée sociale et politique des Frères musulmans. Socialisme arabe et socialisme islamique se rejoignent, avec en priorité un projet économique d'une urgence évidente. L'intégrisme et le fanatisme politiques des Frères se sont estompés. Cette remontée raisonnable de l'authenticité islamique offre peut-être la chance d'une ferveur mobilisatrice des masses arabes. Ces deux évolutions, chacune à sa façon, contestent la pensée politique héritée de l'Occident. Quelques penseurs arabes ont profité de la catastrophe de juin 1967 pour analyser les structures profondes des sociétés arabes actuelles : communautarisme, mentalité « poétique », et surtout expérience originale de l'appartenance nationale. Réflexions sociologiques assez indépendantes des pressions idéologiques pour aider à saisir un phénomène comme le « nationalisme arabe », par exemple. Since the Six-Day War, the two most prominent lines of Arab political thought in the Near East have been, on the one hand, the Palestinian theories of the Arab revolution and, on the other, the Islamisation of the Arab socialism inherited from Nasser. The basic texts put out by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Popular and Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP), and also the more moderate st~<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: These sentiments are cemented in words such as “overripe” (125), “motionless” (138), and “restless” (128); and the sound imagery changes character from a feeling of remembrance to one of forgetfulness: “She turned to me and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn” (131); “hollow, wailing sound” (138); and “I heard a low husky sob” (141). Even the wedding orchestra from the ballroom seems to be playing in a headwind: “From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air” (132).<br>

Abstract: Remembering is a function of the meaning-making process after the emptiness of loss. Spelder and Strickland suggest that “grief is the emotional response to bereavement, to the event of loss” (as qtd. in DuBose, 368). The theologian Todd J. DuBose explains that “grief gazes at an ever-receding present as it moves further and further into the past. The immediate reaction often involves bargaining for a reversal of the loss, denial, anger, shock, anguish, distress, sadness” (368). These reactions are the body's means of trying to make sense of the world in the wake of the emptiness created by bereavement. Interpreting Drew Leder and Maurice Merleau-Ponty's notion of chiasmic structure of the body, DuBose explains that the body realizes its existence only in relation to other bodies. It touches because it is being touched. Other bodies make ours perceptible. The disappearance of these other bodies in death is, in tune with the chiasmic structure of bodily existence, the disappearance of our own bodies. We experience that disappearance as pain, grief, sorrow. These manifestations of pain are, indeed, the ways our bodies adjust to vacuum and fill it with meaning. For DuBose, “meaning-making processes, which
         appearto be immaterial processes, are embodied phenomena. Reflection, perception, feeling, language, even logic make sense only through the influx of the body's ‘reading’ of space, time, action, and sensation” (370).<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: Certainly the number of botched hangings, electrocutions, and even lethal injections indicates that even advanced technologies cannot ensure a pain-free instant death or guarantee that the victim is unconscious at the time of death. In fact, a study of postmortem examinations on prisoners executed by lethal injection concludes that given blood levels of anesthetic, “prisoners may have been capable of feeling pain in almost 90% of cases and may have actually been conscious when they were put to death…. Because a muscle relaxant was used to paralyze them, however, inmates would have been unable to indicate any pain” (Motluk
      2005). This is not, however, merely a practical problem but also and moreover a philosophical one: because we cannot be certain, from a phenomenological perspective, what counts as “the time of death” or as “consciousness of death.”<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Hyperboles are a contextual response to an exigence just as much as they are a way of perceiving and approaching meaning and being in general. Often creating intense
         affectusin the audience, Johnson suggests, “the hyperbolist perceives an extraordinary, outrageous, ridiculous, or ineffableres(thing, event, feeling, idea), while his or herverba(words, speech, language) strain discursive limits, analogical frameworks, and literary and rhetorical conventions, to represent thatres” (2010, 2). Here Johnson indicates that one would not use hyperbole or adopt a hyperbolic perspective unless the magnitude of some event or experience called for and justified its use. To be sure, those such as Levinas are responding to an extraordinary, contextualized experience or event, though it may not be readily apparent that their response is a hyperbolic one, and so the next question for hyperbole thus becomes one of intent. It is often presumed that hyperbole must be intentional, but as Ricoeur and Webb indicate, that is not necessarily the case, since one may be engaging in a practice of excess in philosophical argumentation in response to some extraordinary exigence without being fully aware that one is assuming a hyperbolic mode of thought.<br>

Abstract: Fortunately, we do not have to choose between the two reigning theories in terms of validity or comprehensiveness. Nor do we have to concern ourselves with any overlap that may exist between them. Rather, we can profitably employ them jointly as backgrounded templates for exhibiting the general contours of hope as these defining characteristics reveal themselves in the lives of Shaw and Ricoeur. When we take this approach, an eerie feeling of déjà vu ensues. It is almost as if the leading theoreticians actually studied in depth the biographical details of our principals or interviewed them periodically at length in constructing their perspectives on hope. We virtually see Shaw and Ricoeur in the particulars of the theories they provide. Hence, the thorny issue of what hope actually is—a state of mind, a galvanizing affect, or some combination of the cognitive and the emotional—is essentially moot for what we are trying to accomplish. Our focus is not primarily on the psychodynamics of hope. Professionals in the relevant disciplines can debate the merits of the competing arguments under consideration. For us, it suffices to establish that Shaw and Ricoeur are instructive exemplars, archetypes, or case studies of what hopeful individuals are like in relation to wellness, regardless of the specific theoretical stance on hope behavioral specialists can bring to bear on the endeavor.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on the role of the “Survey on Regional Architecture in Portugal” in 1955 and its effects on contemporary Portuguese architecture. A photographic survey organizes and indexes a group of buildings with precise criteria, allowing a general panorama. In fact these built-environment, large-scale archives play an important role in heritage preservation. In the 1930s, an interesting phenomenon gathered architects who, although committed to the modern movement and enthusiasts of industrial progress, showed a growing interest in vernacular buildings and settlements. Some of these architects became photographers, attentive to a pre-industrial world that was endangered, to record timeless architecture and expose new aesthetic values. This interest generated several movements centered on an appreciation of regional architecture. Along with nostalgia, there stood out the feeling that there were still many lessons to be drawn from these threatened vernacular structures.<br>
