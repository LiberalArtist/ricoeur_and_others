  Book Title: Alef, Mem, Tau-Kabbalistic Musings on Time, Truth, and Death<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfson Elliot R.<br>
  Abstract: This highly original, provocative, and poetic work explores the nexus of time, truth, and death in the symbolic world of medieval kabbalah. Demonstrating that the historical and theoretical relationship between kabbalah and western philosophy is far more intimate and extensive than any previous scholar has ever suggested, Elliot R. Wolfson draws an extraordinary range of thinkers such as Frederic Jameson, Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig, William Blake, Julia Kristeva, Friedrich Schelling, and a host of kabbalistic figures into deep conversation with one another.
      Alef, Mem, Taualso discusses Islamic mysticism and Buddhist thought in relation to the Jewish esoteric tradition as it opens the possibility of a temporal triumph of temporality and the conquering of time through time. The framework for Wolfson's examination is the rabbinic teaching that the wordemet,"truth," comprises the first, middle, and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet,alef, mem,andtau,which serve, in turn, as semiotic signposts for the three tenses of time-past, present, and future. By heeding the letters ofemetwe discern the truth of time manifestly concealed in the time of truth, the beginning that cannot begin if it is to be the beginning, the middle that re/marks the place of origin and destiny, and the end that is the figuration of the impossible disclosing the impossibility of figuration, the finitude of death that facilitates the possibility of rebirth. The time of death does not mark the death of time, but time immortal, the moment of truth that bestows on the truth of the moment an endless beginning of a beginningless end, the truth of death encountered incessantly in retracing steps of time yet to be taken-between, before, beyond.<br>

  15  Prayer and Incarnation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzzs4">The Phenomenology of Prayer</a><br>
  Author(s) MCCULLOUGH LISSA<br>
  Abstract: In the opening chapters of
                  Confessions,the question Augustine broaches before all others is whether we must first beg for help from God to know who God is, or must first know who God is in order to beg for help. Is prayer, then, essentially “begging,” and is “begging” the surest avenue to the divine? Or is begging simply the final resort left to us when all other presumed resources have revealed their finitude and exhaustibility, exposing the naked truth of crucifixion? Is God precisely the crucified one who is there when nothing—absolutely nothing—else is, unveiled in the<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

  26  The Moral Self: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: The work of Levinas attempts to give an account of the uniqueness of the human person, starting from what he believes to be peculiar to persons, the recognition of others as the source of moral obligation. This criterion had already been proposed in the literature of neo-Kantianism, but the formulation it received there had been found wanting. According to Heidegger, the neo-Kantian sees in the ethical a means for transcending human finitude: “There is something in the categorical imperative which exceeds the finite being.”¹ But for Heidegger the concept of the ethical can display itself only in relation to a<br>

  Abstract: In anthropology, the sacred has long been viewed as a unique register of human existence that is at times intimately associated with human suffering in its various forms and manifestations. Often enfolded within such orientations to the potential sacredness of human suffering are associated moral experiences and ethical concerns. Whether understood in the context of painful rituals of initiation, in the light of pain-induced transformations in consciousness, in the context of particular salvational orientations to loss, illness, human finitude, and death, or in the tendency to view suffering as a means of sacrificing one’s own desires for the benefit of<br>

  FOUR  Skepticism, Finitude, and Sin from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Acknowledgment is an interpretation of knowledge, Cavell insists, or perhaps an interpretation of what lies at the heart of any knowledge, entailing a certain sense of receptivity or responsiveness, a willingness to confess and reveal oneself in a practical and responsible reply to the other, the world, or as I have suggested, to God. But such acknowledgment presupposes a separation from that which one responds to, or more generally, it presupposes finitude. Central to Wittgenstein’s philosophy, and thus also to Cavell’s own philosophy, is therefore the acknowledgment of human limitation, an acknowledgment that, however, seems hard to achieve.

  SEVEN  Forgiveness and Passivity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous three chapters, I have attempted to outline what I have sometimes called an anthropology of finitude. The basic findings seemed less than cheerful, such that we are finite and mortal and yet revolt against our conditions (chapter 4), that we are vulnerable to tragic consequences because we speak and act in ways that outrun our previews (chapter 5), and that we, confronted with the otherness of the other, harbor violent impulses (chapter 6). If one holds these considerations together, one reaches a reasonable backdrop of what makes forgiveness important to human affairs—that is, why humans stand<br>

  Chapter II  On how law becomes freedom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b9x1k5">Grand Hotel Abyss</a><br>
  Abstract: If we take seriously the definition of desire outlined in the previous chapter, important questions remain concerning its ultimate social application. Still, it is a useful starting point for unpacking the concepts of individuality and intersubjectivity underlying the reflection on the modern subject conducted by one of its most definitive theoreticians – namely, Hegel; Hegel’s efforts in this direction turn on a critique, buttressed by the concept of negativity, of that which some have termed the “analytics of finitude.” In this sense, a return to Hegel allows us to ask what was truly at stake in his complex, polyphonic movement towards<br>

  Chapter IV  The coupling of sex and death is not exclusive to decadent romantics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b9x1k5">Grand Hotel Abyss</a><br>
  Abstract: After our initial look at how certain aspects of Hegel’s account of desire might transform the concept of individuality, we turned to possible repercussions for his theories of juridical ordering and the state. Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Abstract: In parts 1 and 2, we tried to see how desire might pass beyond dialectical self-mediation to the metaxological community of being. I now want to develop the possibilities afforded by the metaxological view to provide some further picture of that limiting otherness, especially as it is disclosed through the sublime as aesthetic infinitude and through agapeic otherness. I will draw on many of the key notions discussed previously—for instance, the contrast between desire as lacking and agapeic goodwill, the sense of overdetermined being of original selfhood, the coexistence in human desire of an exigence for immanent wholeness and<br>

  Book Title: Hope and the Longing for Utopia-Futures and Illusions in Theology and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

  Chapter 1  Introduction: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284xvg">Idling the Engine</a><br>
  Abstract: In a book about a strand of skepticism in certain twentieth-century novels, why turn to Paradise Lost as a precursor? Don Quixote or Tristram Shandy, say, would seem more natural choices, but I begin instead with Milton’s epic because of what might be called its orientation to human finitude. The skeptics in and around the books I will discuss later regard human finitude as a matter of the gravest concern, even as the source of failure of all human endeavor. Paradise Lost does not share in this confusion, but it does recognize it, portray it in intimate detail, and clear<br>

The scenery is resplendent, but the poet is haunted by the sense that all the beauty will be destroyed by the passage of time. Everything that may be desired as beautiful bears its own destruction within itself because it is temporal and begins to pass away as soon as it comes to be. The poet’s conclusion is that such temporal finitude deprives beauty of its value. As Freud explains: “All that he would otherwise have loved and admired seemed to him shorn of<br>

  Abstract: Part I suggested the theory of time which underwrites Marcel’s philosophy to be problematic, for although he plainly declares his lack of interest in its ontology, he nevertheless is concerned with human Being. Owing to the temporal character of human existence, time is thus necessarily bound up with Marcel’s ontological investigations. The conclusions he draws from his phenomenological

  VII  Hermeneutics in Dialogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: If anything is universal in philosophical hermeneutics, it is probably the recognition of one’s own finitude, the consciousness that actual speech does not suffice to exhaust the inner conversation that impels us toward understanding. Gadamer ties the universality of the hermeneutic process to the fact that understanding depends on this ongoing conversation: “That a conversation occurs, no matter when or where or with whom, wherever something comes to language, whether this is another person, a thing, a word, a flame (Gottfried Benn)—this is what constitutes the universality of hermeneutic experience.”¹ Only in conversation, only in confrontation with another’s thought<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80n4b">Kierkegaard as Humanist</a><br>
  Abstract: Kierkegaard says, quite simply, that the task set for every human being is to become a self. In this deceptively plain word “task”
                     (Opgave),he concentrates all the complexities of his understanding of the human self. By explicating the ramifications of this term, we will come to see how Kierkegaard understands the emergence of the self as a “third” (entity, or reality, or structure) beyond but including the polarities of body/soul, finitude/infinitude, necessity/possibility.<br>

  Abstract: If cosmology, as a product of human activity, pretends to deal with the universe in its totality, assuming this totality in the natural attitude of mind as omni-spatiality and omni-temporality, it must exercise bravery in combination with a healthy skepticism in making pronouncements about the whole, by being only a tiny part of this whole. In spite of the fact that the philosophical mind, that is, a critical mind, accounts for its own incomprehensibility of this totality on the grounds of the finitude of humanity, this finitude is at the same time counterweighted by its alleged infinitude. For example, Kant,<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttprf">Out of Time</a><br>
  Abstract: Grasping the foundational status of time requires acceding to finitude as our ultimate horizon. Just as artists, scientists, and philosophers of the twentieth century tried to integrate time into thought, they also attempted to affirm the inescapability of finitude. We reject temporality because we cannot accept finitude, and we construct the idea of eternity in order to avoid it.¹ Major philosophers and physicists of the twentieth century explain the denial of temporality in this manner. In
                  The Direction of Time, for instance, physicist Hans Reichenbach contends that our failure to properly understand time stems from our flight from death. He<br>

  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Abstract: A clear awareness of the reality of our own finitude being a possibly unbearable source of anxiety, we may at times be tempted to actually believe in our own immortality. Autobiographic, biographic and museographic possibilities for after-lives seduce us into imagining the constraints of the real being eliminated if we keep a tense yet measured distance – a coy similitude or a pantographic relationship – toward our (self) image. As epistemological technologies of virtual space, museums and collections keep the real at a manageable distance in the face of anxieties.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: This essay takes up the claim made recently by Simon Critchley in The Companion to Continental Philosophy that a "feature common to many philosophers in the Continental tradition" is the "utopian demand that things be otherwise." The general question I pursue has to do with whether or not such a claim includes movements within Continental philosophy that do not self-identify with the utopian (like critical theory). The particular question has to do with whether or not the movement of phenomenology is utopian or does it, because of its other commitments, view the utopian as the antithesis to its orientation, which makes that claim that phenomenology is utopian seem strange. My thesis is that phenomenology can be seen as a utopian tradition but that some account must be given that demonstrates this connection to the utopian. In particular, I argue that Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology provides an understanding of the utopian, which I call a non-conventional view, that is vastly different from the one assumed by most when they see or hear the word "utopian," which I lable conventional. I show that such a non-conventional understanding can be developed in a way that neither requires us to view the utopian solely as opposed to finitude and contingency, nor a form of thought and action from which we necessarily need to dissociate ourselves. It is this non-conventional view of the utopian that in the end enables us to understand how Continental philosophy in general and phenomenology in particular are important bearers of the utopian demand that things be otherwise.<br>

Abstract: En juillet 2012, un tribunal de Cologne a émis un jugement considérant que la circon-
cision sans raisons médicales constituait une atteinte à l'intégrité corporelle de l'enfant.
Depuis, l'Allemagne a adopté un projet de loi qui précise que la circoncision est autorisée si
l'opération respecte un cadre médical professionnel, afin d'éviter des jugements comme celui
de Cologne, qui avait provoqué un tollé dans les communautés juive et musulmane.<br>

Abstract: What is eco-phenomenology? This paper argues that eco-phenomenology, in which are folded both an ecological phenomenology and a phenomenological ecology, offers us a way of developing a middle ground between phenomenology and naturalism, between intentionality and causality. Our grasp of Nature is significantly altered by thinking through four strands of time's plexity — the invisibility of time, the celebration of finitude, the coordination of rhythms, and the interruption and breakdown of temporal horizons. It is also transformed by a meditation on the role of boundaries in constituting the varieties of thinghood. Eco-phenomenology takes up in a tentative and exploratory way the traditional phenomenological claim to be able to legislate for the sciences, or at least to think across the boundaries that seem to divide them. In this way, it opens up and develops an access to Nature and the natural, one which is independent both of the conceptuality of the natural sciences and of traditional metaphysics.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: Desire, as Martin Hägglund claims in
         Dying For Time, has been erringly conceived in philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic traditions as testifying to a fundamental lack of being. In response, Hägglund develops the notion of chronolibido, a theory that posits the constitutive difference of desire as testifying to temporal finitude and mortality as the object of desire. In the rubric of chronolibido, the desire for immortality dissimulates a preceding desire for survival. This review takes up Hägglund's theory of desire and examines the implications of chronolibido for reading modernist literature.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>
