  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Abstract: Jesus Christ brings the forgiveness of sin and a proleptic foretaste of new creation. Attention is directed toward the conflict between the new creation and the old because this conflict resulted in the crucifixion of Jesus and led to the resurrection to new life on Easter. On the basis of this Easter victory, Jesus becomes the Christ, the bringer of the new aeon in his role as the final wisdom, the final prophet, the<br>

  Abstract: St. Augustine begins his
                  Confessionswith a prayer, a prayer that questions how and why we pray: “How shall I call upon my God, my God and Lord?”¹ Much has been said about the epistemological issues raised by prayer, which questions what can be known of God, and of the implications of confessing to an omniscient God who knows of our guilt and our remorse before the confession is given voice.² However, in addition to these individual questions of knowledge, guilt, expiation, and forgiveness, Augustine also questions the collective significance of his confession-cum-prayer and asks, near the end of the<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

The biblical idea of God as Judge and Redeemer is borne in on our minds by moral experience, our sense of sin and desire of forgiveness, and also by religious experience.

  Author(s) MANOUSSAKIS JOHN PANTELEIMON<br>
  Abstract: For the past several decades, continental philosophy has exhibited an ongoing concern with what we might call liminal phenomena, among them friendship, the gift, mourning, responsibility, forgiveness, and hospitality. Of course, to call these “phenomena” already begs the question, or at least a question, the question of whether and to what extent these events actually take place. Thinking in the wake of Jacques Derrida it is impossible to ignore, for example, the excess of the call to forgiveness over the sort of forgiveness that actually takes place in concrete situations. In the case of hospitality, this excess is apparent in<br>

  Abstract: In a world where justice appears to be the most one can ask for, there is no room for forgiveness and much space for the particular cruelties practiced in the name of the war against wickedness. Significantly, those who stress justice often turn it most harshly upon themselves. According to Paul Ricoeur in

  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Murphy Jeffrie G.<br>
  Abstract: Most current talk of forgiveness and reconciliation in the aftermath of collective violence proceeds from an assumption that forgiveness is always superior to resentment and refusal to forgive. Victims who demonstrate a willingness to forgive are often celebrated as virtuous moral models, while those who refuse to forgive are frequently seen as suffering from a pathology. Resentment is viewed as a negative state, held by victims who are not "ready" or "capable" of forgiving and healing.<br>

  Abstract: After working extensively with the problems facing postwar countries and with victims in particular, Eric Stover, in a 1999 interview, expressed fatigue with reconciliation talk.² His comments came after the interviewer characterized Stover’s work with forensic investigations and postwar reconstruction as part of a process of reconciliation. I wrote this book because I felt a similar fatigue with the rhetoric of forgiveness, closure, and reconciliation, and I wanted to challenge a certain cluster of unquestioned assumptions and implied inferences. This book offers examples from various contexts, but the rhetoric and logic against which it objects are part of a global<br>

  Abstract: In the previous three chapters, I have attempted to outline what I have sometimes called an anthropology of finitude. The basic findings seemed less than cheerful, such that we are finite and mortal and yet revolt against our conditions (chapter 4), that we are vulnerable to tragic consequences because we speak and act in ways that outrun our previews (chapter 5), and that we, confronted with the otherness of the other, harbor violent impulses (chapter 6). If one holds these considerations together, one reaches a reasonable backdrop of what makes forgiveness important to human affairs—that is, why humans stand<br>

As a general rule of thumb, these sentiments of Thomas and Marion simply remind us of the enduring and ineliminable

  Author(s) THEIßEN HENNING<br>
  Abstract: In Western theology, the doctrine of the atonement has been dominated by forensic language and the image of the courtroom. Forensic language has been particularly important to a Lutheran understanding of justification: where, by grace through faith, sinners are “declared righteous” on account of Christ. Such language has been criticized, however, for not doing justice to a fuller New Testament understanding of salvation which includes the forgiveness of sins, healing, reconciliation, restoration, and wholeness, and which is experienced communally as well as individually. By so strongly emphasizing forensic imagery in both the doctrine of justification and the atonement, Lutheranism is<br>

That is, if Marion names the unconditioned and names it God, then surely he too must seek permission for this presumptive attempt at impossible signification. It is thinking the unconditioned, the

  Abstract: In a volume that aims to expand our understandings of Christian love by clarifying love’s meaning in theory and practice, a chapter devoted to “forgiveness” may appear marginal to the task. Yet the opposite is the case. There is no genuine Christian forgiveness without love, and love is sometimes tested in its ultimate possibility and imperative by the forgiveness it generates. Moreover, the construals of forgiveness that are central to much of Christian theology slip into caricature unless they include love in their foundation, framework, and movement.

  Abstract: What is sin? Is it simply wrongdoing? Why do its effects linger over time? In this sensitive, imaginative, and original work, Gary Anderson shows how changing conceptions of sin and forgiveness lay at the very heart of the biblical tradition. Spanning nearly two thousand years, the book brilliantly demonstrates how sin, once conceived of as a physical burden, becomes, over time, eclipsed by economic metaphors. Transformed from a weight that an individual carried, sin becomes a debt that must be repaid in order to be redeemed in God's eyes.<br>

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed? Banki shows that if today we cannot simply escape the "worldwidization" of forgiveness, then it is necessary to rethink what forgiveness is, the conditions under which it supposedly takes place, and especially its relation to justice.<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

Abstract: This rhetorical theme is consonant with other Western traditions in times of war. It is well known that Popes Urban, Innocent, and others promised heavenly rewards to crusaders.
            66Pope Leo III blessed the swords of Charlemagne’s army and backed the campaign motto of “baptism or death” in 800, and Pope Leo IX (1049–54) promised forgiveness of sins in heaven and the title of martyr to those who would fight against fearless sinners and die.67As did the crusading church, the Quran promises forgiveness of sins to warriors who fight for the cause: “God has preferred those who strive hard over those who remain passive with a mighty reward: degrees of honor, forgiveness of sins and His grace” (4:95–99).68<br>

Abstract: Literature that takes up the gift in its philosophical, theological, or anthropological modes abounds. For the phenomenological context, see Jacques Derrida,
            Donner le temps: 1, Le fausse monnaie(Paris: Galileé, 1991), 71–77. Translated into English by Peggy Kamuf as Jacques Derrida,Given Time: 1, Counterfeit Money(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 50–52; Jacques Derrida, “On the Gift: A Discussion between Jacques Derrida and Jean‐Luc Marion, Moderated by Richard Kearney,” inGod, The Gift, and Postmodernism, ed. John D. Caputo and Michael J. Scanlon (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999), 58–59. Philosophical and anthropological appropriation of the gift has had a wide history. On this see Karen Sykes,Arguing with Anthropology: An Introduction to Critical Theories of the Gift(New York: Routledge, 2005). Many theologians have taken up similar questions as the philosophers and anthropologists in conjunction with God’s grace, human community, the practices of forgiveness and hospitality, and many other matters. For at least one brief overview, see Sarah Coakley, “Why Gift? Gift, Gender and Trinitarian Relations in Milbank and Tanner,”Scottish Journal of Theology61 (2008): 224–35.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But why, then, does Faustus have this relation in his mind to the devil? As the reformers argued about the magician, Faustus inclines to the devil because he rejects faith, which is to say that he refuses to believe that God promises him immortal happiness. Indeed, critics have long since noticed that Faustus has complete aphasia on the subject of mercy—in his first soliloquy, of course, he omits the lines of 1 John that promise forgiveness to those who repent, rather perversely proclaiming instead that the Bible insists “we must sin, / And so consequently die…an everlasting death” (1.1.46–48).
      25But Faustus erases the promise of God's mercy because he disdains the dualistic Christian metaphysics that underlie that very promise. Christian dualism is taken for granted in the play even by Mephistopheles, who makes a clear distinction between body and soul, radically subordinating the value of the former to the latter. When Faustus orders him to attack the old man, the devil replies: “his faith is great / I cannot touch his soul. / But what I may afflict his body with / I will attempt, which is but little worth” (5.1.79–82). In contrast to his conjured companion, Faustus values the body more than the soul, as if for him the truly sacred communion were found not in the valence of symbolic bread but in the juicy and perfumed grapes he gives to the hugely pregnant duchess, who has been longing for fruit through the dearth of winter.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: In addition to developing a theological anthropology, Regan lays the groundwork for a human rights praxis of “just memory,” drawing on the work of Paul Ricoeur. Situating human rights discourse between the memory of suffering and the hope for a better future, Regan develops an ethics toward just memory, which includes allowing individuals to face the scars and wounds of memory in order to work through the past (101), enabling the pragmatic use of memory throughout a community through construction of narrative (101–2), and articulating an ethical-political duty of remembrance for purposes of preventing destructive tendencies, allowing the possibility of forgiveness, and retaining a heritage of victimization to counter the historical tendency to celebrate victors (102). Regan discusses the report of human rights violations and their individual and societal impacts, produced by the Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, as an example of how such an ethic can be put into practice.<br>

Abstract: However, the peculiar fact is that Priestly sources tended to draw a clear distinction between disease and sin. For example, unlike non-Priestly sources which frequently depicted leprosy as a punishment (e.g., Numbers 12; 2 Kings 5:26–27; 2 Chronicles 26:16–21), P makes no inference of this sort.
         
               Moreover, the rationales given in the sin offering instructions clearly distinguish between offerings brought on account of transgressions (Leviticus 4; 16; Numbers 15: 22–31) and those brought on account of impurities (Leviticus 12; 14–15). Whereas the sin offering in the former cases served to expiate sin and gain forgiveness, in the latter cases it merely removed Defilement.77
            
               This distinction would seem to differentiate P’s perspective from the conflation of sin and disease implied by David’s curse. On this background, the requirement that the leper and gonorrheic bring expiatory offerings (Leviticus 14–15) is best understood as reflecting the conservatism of cult practice.78<br>

Abstract: Although Hannah Arendt distinguishes three human activities from each other in Human Condition — labor, work and action — they are supposed not to be three different types of human activities but to be three different aspects of human activity. Assuming this to be the case, this paper demonstrates that social theory has not enough taken action in the sense of Arendt into account, even modern scholars such as Bourdieu, but it has continued to remain almost always on the level of work because of its concept of time. The second question is what consequence social theory may draw, if this aspect of human activity is recognized as essential and its concept of time changed. One answer proposed by the author is the sociology of forgiveness even though it has not been treated as a subject for modern sociology.<br>

Author(s): Tran Jonathan<br>
Abstract: Miroslav Volf has provocatively argued that redemption necessitates forgetting (1996, 2006). Yet, Volf's claims insufficiently consider the narratival configuration of memory. This essay utilises Paul Ricoeur's work on mimesis in order to challenge Volf's case for forgetting. The author advances Ricoeur's philosophical description of forgiveness toward a theological account of divine forgiveness as re-narration, gift-giving funded by trinitarian abundance.<br>

Abstract: Dealing with North Korea is perhaps one of the most difficult challenges in global politics today. Totalitarian and reclusive, ideologically isolated and economically ruined, it is the inherent 'other' in a globalised and neo-liberal world order. The respective approaches are correspondingly divided: a confrontational approach relies on the projection of military threats and aims to undermine the authoritarian regime as fast as possible, leading to a quick disintegration and subsequent absorption. The second approach favours engaging North Korea in political, economic and cultural interactions. The essay outlines why engagement is more suited to diffusing tension on the peninsula and avoid a war. But it also draws attention to key issues that remain largely unaddressed: how exactly people divided by the traumatic memory of conflict and death might coexist in a respectful and non-violent manner, or whether or not forgiveness is necessary to promote reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: In the context of the family’s crisis, in addition to the marital failures that produce suffering and inconvenience, there are biases due to controversies, ideological interests and opinions, which originate general and simplistic solutions to complex problems with peculiar characteristics. The article, – according to the commitment of the Holy Father Francisco to mitigate the heavy burden of people in “irregular” unions (where situations of fragility or misery improve stigma of exclusion) – try demonstrate the continuity of the Magisterium Pontifical Council, in which
         Amoris Laetitiaand the reform of the canonical matrimonial process were inserted. Through the study of the answers and the search for solutions that are careful to the hierarchy of truths, the Holy Father pointed out: “to generate personal and personalized processes”; to follow paths of reflection and discreet understanding the conditions of each case; ultimately, to help progress guided by a logic of forgiveness and reconciliation, according to a merciful and encouraging pastoral care. Sacraments and consciences, both sacred, require to be served with truth.<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Abstract: Shaftesbury's deism, widely representative of eighteenth-century liberal theology, may be profitably viewed as a reaction against Puritanism in particular and Pauline theology in general. Seen from this perspective, it implies, without explicitly asserting, a reduction of moral standards from the infinite conception of moral law characteristic of Protestantism. Shaftesbury showed no appreciation of the need for redemption or forgiveness, and changed the emphasis in religion from devotion to God above all else to a purely anthropocentric morality which God merely supported. But, in spite of the crudity of his theology and the dubious implications of his ethics, Shaftesbury sought to combat some of the harmful psychological effects to which Paulinism might lead when received in the wrong spirit, and manifested genuine religious insight in this effort.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: Can the act of creation itself be considered like an infinite forgiveness that God turns to the earth and to those who live there after having preferred the waters as his place of first existence? The conference "In the beginning it was the forgiveness" held in L'Aquila in the occasion of a pluriconfessional meeting, suggests some hypothesis starting even from some biblical episodes like: the universal deluge, the Amalek's remembering, Giuseppe and his brothers, Isaac's sacrifice, and furthermore with Moses' death, to end with the forgiveness from the original sin through the entrance in the promise land. A suggestive analysis of the forgiveness in the Hebraism, seen too often as a pure religion of the contraposition law to the forgiveness given from the religion of love. The forgiveness in this way is dealt with the inter-religious point of view, and also with the human one that in the relationship between God and man has its top and beginning in the solemnity of Kippur.<br>

Abstract: Moving from repression or tyranny toward the rule of law and reason is fraught with difficulties. One question of transitional justice is whether those responsible for the horrors of the previous régime should be punished or whether those involved in the transition should travel a path toward forgiveness and unity. Within this article, it is urged that in the (re-)establishment of the rule of reason among all involved there is a commitment to peace as opposed to force. This commitment marks retribution and utilitarian punishment as incoherent and normatively indefensible. Resorting to punishment is the abandonment of reason, not its reinstatement. Indeed, the point can be generalized. Punishment, as resorting to force, is a move away from establishing or sustaining a framework of justification and its commitment to peace.<br>

Author(s): AUBENQUE Pierre<br>
Abstract: Le structuralisme est défini ici comme le transfert du modèle structural, qui a fait ses preuves en linguistique depuis F. de Saussure, à d'autres domaines de la vie humaine. L'auteur s'interroge moins sur la légitimité d'un tel transfert, qui, dans certaines limites, peut toujours être épistémologiquement justifié, que sur les raisons philosophiques et sociologiques qui ont pu conduire à sa généralisation. Le structuralisme, qui a tendance à ramener les conflits historiques réels à un système d'oppositions signifiantes, n'est pas seulement incompatible avec le marxisme ; forme à peine plus subtile du positivisme, il est à ranger aussi bien parmi les produits idéologiques de la société industrielle avancée que parmi les symptômes de l'oubli de l'être. Structuralism transfers the structural pattern, which has proved successful in Linguistics since F. de Saussure, into other fields of human life. What is questioned here is less the legitimacy of that transfer which, within limits, may always be epistemologically justified, than the philosophical and sociological grounds of such a generalization. Structuralism, prone to reduce real historical conflicts to a system of signifying oppositions, is not only incompatible with Marxism, but, as a slightly more subtile form of positivism, is both an ideological product of advanced industrial society and a symptom of forgiveness of being.<br>

Abstract: Dans L'Étoile de la rédemption de Franz Rosenzweig, une topologie articule la question du pardon en tant que non-originaire. La distribution qui scande, organise et tisse toute une série de reliaisons faisant « système » dans L'Étoile, c'est : Création /révélation /rédemption comme modes relationnels et temporels déterminant des façons pour l'homme de se trouver pris dans des liaisons spécifiques avec Dieu, avec le monde, avec les autres hommes. Dans ces réseaux tissés par L'Étoile, la question est de savoir si le pardon est chose humaine ou grâce divine, « propre de l'homme » ou « propre de dieu » et de quoi il pourrait bien être, du coup, l'« impropre ». In the Star of Redemption of Franz Rosenzweig the forgiveness ist not really originary. The dispatching or distribution model who rules a multiplicity of « systematic » relations in the Star is the triplicity Creation/Revelation/Redemption. Thus the question is: is forgiveness a human affair or a divine favor ? Is it practicable in the community or is it a matter of inter subjectivity ? The themes of time, love, forgiveness and otherness are central in this reflexion.<br>

Abstract: Dans l'Essai sur le mal, Jean Nabert, poursuivant une démarche déjà engagée dans les Éléments pour une éthique, affronte la question de la possibilité d'une justification de l'existence humaine, L'A. propose une analyse des grandes étapes de cet essai Dans le ch. 1, il décrit les diverses figures d'un mal excédant le champ défini par les normes de la moralité, et recherche les conditions de possibilité d'une telle expérience. Dans les ch. 2 à 4, il poursuit l'analyse de l'expérience d'un mal intérieur au vouloir propre et que dissimule la réduction de celui-ci à la transgression des normes d'un sujet autonome, et il examine la compréhension de soi du sujet de l'expérience impliquée dans cette dimension du mal. Dans le dernier chapitre, il pose la question des limites de ce que permet d'espérer une « approche de la justification » par un moi tel qu'il s'est d'abord compris par réflexion sur ces données fondamentales de son expérience; au sommet de cette approche, il aborde la question de la possibilité du pardon. Pursuing along the same lines as in his Éléments pour une éthique, Jean Nabert, in his Essai sur le mal, tackles the question of the possibility of justifying human existence. The author proposes to analyze the major stages in this essay. In chapter 1, he describes diverse representations of evil that exceed the boundaries as defined by the norms of morality, and researches the conditions in which such experiences are possible. In chapters 2 to 4, he continues the analysis of evil intrinsic to will itself, which is obscured by the reduction of this evil to the transgression of an autonomous subject's limits, and examines the subject's comprehension of self when implicated in this dimension of evil. In the last chapter, the question is asked of the limitations of that which an « approach to justification » may permit to be hoped for by a self such as first understood upon reflexion of the fundamental data of his experience; at the apex of this approach, he ad~<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Abstract: Hayes frequently uses recombination and assiduously designed constraints to link his poems to those of African American women poets who have preceded him. In
         Hip Logic, he includes as an epigraph a poem “made up of whole and partial lines in the index (underW) ofThe Collected Poems of.”audre lorde
            
               The collection also includes a sonnet entirely made up of the line “We sliced the watermelon into smiles” repeated fourteen times, and several odes. The bulk of the book is made up of a series of poems titled “A Gram of &S,” based on the daily word game found in the puzzle section of newspapers. Hayes explains in a note, “I end each line with one of the eleven words derived from the title word, while abiding by the other rules of the game: 1. Words must be derived from four or more letters. 2. Words that acquire four letters by the addition of ‘s,’ such as ‘bats’ or ‘dies’ are not used. 3. Only one form of a verb is used.”91
            
               In a more recent collection titled92
            Lighthead, Hayes also uses constraints. Reading just the end words of “The Golden Shovel” inLightheadgives the entirety of Gwendolyn Brooks's poem “We Real Cool”:
               
            When I am so small Da's sock covers my arm, we
               Cruise at twilight until we find the place the real
            
               Brooks's poem has been literally re-authored, as has Elizabeth Alexander's “Ladders,” which emerges in the end words of Hayes' poem “The Last Train to Africa”Men lean, bloodshot and translucent with cool.

               in precisely the same way. Homage and lineage are inscribed directly into Hayes's poems, so that the reader cannot read one without the other. This incorporation of the precursor is more thoroughgoing than an onomastic reference or dedication: it literally reproduces the precursor poem. As Hayes's new poem circulates, Brooks's ~<br>

Abstract: Finally, Ricoeur's formulation of threefold mimesis in
      Time and Narrativefocuses on agency but does not specifically consider its function in the production and consumption of public memory. Ricoeur's most substantive, explicit discussion of the relationship between public remembering and public acting appears in the epilogue ofMemory, History, Forgetting, where he uses Arendt's work to address the problem of forgiveness (2004, 457–506). Although incredibly illuminating, this philosophical investigation does not aim to provide a strategy for reading examples of memory—or, more specifically, thepublicmemory that interests rhetorical critics.
               Yet Ricoeur's earlier works link agency to temporality and the world in ways that can be productively adapted as a hermeneutic tool for reading practices of public memory. Ricoeur approaches agency as a time-bound, text-mediated capacity to affect the self and envision a new world. My conception of the agential spiral takes Ricoeur's threefold mimesis a step further by considering how a specific set of texts figures agency in ways that are inspired by past actions, shaped by contemporary public cultures, and potentially productive of future agency.7<br>
