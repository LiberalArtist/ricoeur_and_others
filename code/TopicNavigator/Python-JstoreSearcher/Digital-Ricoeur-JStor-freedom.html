  Abstract: As a third-world endeavor, the essence of Egypt’s revolutionary movement was to provide its citizens with land, employment, peace, and freedom. Like similar movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America during the age of decolonization, it hoped to forge an authentic and sovereign subject who was liberated from the mental habits of people under colonial domination. Therefore, above all, Nasserism was a quest for a kind of dignity that formed the inner meaning of the word

  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Abstract: Every community that wants to last beyond a single generation must concern itself with education. Education has to do with the maintenance of a community through the generations. This maintenance must assure enough continuity of vision, value, and perception so that the community sustains its self-identity. At the same time, such maintenance must assure enough freedom and novelty so that the community can survive in and be pertinent to new circumstances.¹ Thus, education must attend to processes of both continuity and discontinuity in order to avoid fossilizing into irrelevance on the one hand, and relativizing into disappearance on the other<br>

  Abstract: In the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to

Allegory is characterized by violence and is not at all beautiful, admittedly lacking “all ‘symbolic’ freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity” (166;Der Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels145). Any time allegory is subjected to the critical palate of philosophical taste, it will seem a bitter alternative to beauty.

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

Freedom from chores, school, and responsibility revealed itself as boredom to me and my brother on a humid afternoon.

  Book Title: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Terms of the Political: Community, Immunity, Biopolitics presents a decade of thought about the origins and possibilities of political theory from one of contemporary Italy's most prolific and engaging political theorists, Roberto Esposito. He has coined a number of critical concepts in current debates about the past, present, and future of biopolitics-from his work on the implications of the etymological and philosophical kinship of community (communitas) and immunity (immunitas) to his theorizations of the impolitical and the impersonal. Taking on interlocutors from throughout the Western philosophical tradition, from Aristotle and Augustine to Weil, Arendt, Nancy, Foucault, and Agamben, Esposito announces the eclipse of a modern political lexicon-"freedom," "democracy," "sovereignty," and "law"-that, in its attempt to protect human life, has so often produced its opposite (violence, melancholy, and death). Terms of the Political calls for the opening of political thought toward a resignification of these and other operative terms-such as "community," "immunity," "biopolitics," and "the impersonal"-in ways that affirm rather than negate life. An invaluable introduction to the breadth and rigor of Esposito's thought, the book will also welcome readers already familiar with Esposito's characteristic skill in overturning and breaking open the language of politics.<br>

  Abstract: Before taking up how the theme of freedom relates to community, I would like to consider something even more fundamental that involves the entire political lexicon and the growing difficulty such a lexicon faces in signifying its own object—namely, the political.¹ A true barrier seems to have been erected between language and politics. It is as if politics has escaped from language, as if language no longer has any words with which to name politics. As early as the 1930s, Simone Weil wrote, “On inspection, almost all the words and phrases of our political vocabulary turn out to be<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: The doctrine of productive imagination that informs Kant’s theory of art would appear to complement his discourse on freedom, the cornerstone of the three
                  Critiques. It is far from obvious, however, whether Kant’s efforts to develop a model of practical human autonomy are in any sense “clarified” by his statement that poetry “sets the imagination free.” A great deal of scholarship on Romanticism has relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the assumption of a substantive connection between creativity and liberty—if not their outright identity—but this position is rarely evaluated by trying to use it as a vantage point from<br>

  Abstract: Jaspers shares with the Hegelians a tendency to stress the dependence of the self upon social and linguistic intercourse between human beings. And he shares with the logical empiricists and linguistic analysts an abiding concern with words, signs, and symbols. But in other respects he is at loggerheads with both groups.

  Book Title: Citizenship in Heaven and on Earth-Karl Barth's Ethics<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Massmann Alexander<br>
  Abstract: While Karl Barth is one of the most significant theologians of the twentieth century, his contribution to ethics is less well known and subject to controversy among interpreters. Barth combined his commitment to the church and its particular task in faith and theology with a concern for ethics and politics in wider society. By examining the historical development of Barth’s ethics, this study traces the vital influences and considerable shifts in Barth’s understanding of the ethical task, situating him within his political context. Alexander Massmann provides a comprehensive explication and assessment of the full scope of Barth’s ethics, from the first edition of the Romans commentary to the final volume of the Church Dogmatics. General questions of Barth’s methodology in ethics and case studies in applied ethics are both analyzed in their intricate connection to his dogmatic thought. The study highlights how an ethical approach emerged in which the freedom of the gospel allows for considerable openness to empirical insights from other disciplines. The author reevaluates Barth’s ethics in a constructive vision of the role of the church in the quest for a just society.<br>

  Abstract: This book aims to enable a user to become closely familiar with a limited number of Older Testament texts and so be in a position to form judgments about them and, resulting from that, to have an under- standing of the nature of biblical text itself. Beyond this, the reality that these are key texts for the understanding of the Bible means that they have fundamental impact for the basics of faith today our understanding of ourselves before God, essential to faith in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Israel's prophets reflect on the role of God in human life; faith in God's love, God's passion for justice, the essential place of fidelity in faith. Israel's foundational narratives explore the nature of human lives before God; they include issues such as creation, human freedom, and faith in God's unshakeable commitment to human life. Alongside these concerns, there is the importance of getting a feel for the nature of scripture.<br>

  Abstract: A case could be made that philosophy is the safeguard of human freedom. For if our environmental, economic, and cultural worlds are determined primarily by
                  howwe think, and only subsequently bywhatwe think, then all power passes through thought, and thinking otherwise is the essence of liberation. Thus liberation would be conceived as liberation from oppression, injustice, ignorance, and illusion. If liberation fromoppressionmay be conceived as the freedom to access and employ physical, social, and educational resources required for human flourishing without fear of external appropriation or restriction, then such liberation may be conceived, in turn,<br>

  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

Throughout the region, these challenges often took the form of debates over freedom of religion, the role of religion in state educational systems, civil marriage, and secular cemeteries.

  Abstract: Drawing on the expertise of sixteen scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development,
         Slavery's Capitalismidentifies slavery as the primary force driving key innovations in entrepreneurship, finance, accounting, management, and political economy that are too often attributed to the so-called free market. Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

In concise, direct, and deeply felt chapters, Peperzak moves from Plato, Plotinus, and the Early Christian theologians to Anselm, Bonaventure, Descartes, Pascal, Leibniz, Hegel, and Levinas. Throughout these carefully linked essays, he touches on the fundamental ideas-from reason and faith to freedom and tradition-that inform the questions his work has consistently addressed, most specifically those concerning philosophy as a practice.<br>

  Author(s) Hinlicky Paul R.<br>
  Abstract: Bonhoeffer’s¹ theology of Christian agency is shaped by his notion of “being for others,” formulated also as living or existing for others. In this chapter, the interpersonal dimensions of action will be put into the foreground. With that aim, the following questions will be raised: what moves Christians to act? Does such acting necessarily entail fatherly and obedient approach of a dependent within and outside of the church? How is Christian acting interconnected with Christian freedom and equality? Since Christian acting is to find its fullest expression in the church, is there a connection between his understanding of Christian acting<br>

One cluster sees cultural, social and political rebellion as ephemeral, politically inconsequential or absorbed into the mainstream.

Power, politics and empowerment have provided determinant frames of selfconstitution and social emancipation in the modern world, and they have provided the singular definition of freedom as well.<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of sociology partly originated from a perception of the limitations of political philosophy. The transition to modernity demanded new ways of addressing the questions that political philosophy had typically posed, such as the nature of authority, the conditions of the good life, the definition of justice, the degrees of freedom, and the prerequisites of inclusion in a community. Classical sociological theory reflected the modern appreciation of the independence of ‘the social’ relative to ‘the political’ and the need to understand the internal dynamics of ‘the social’ in their own terms. In a stronger sense, sociological theory suggested that<br>

  Book Title: New Thinking in Islam-The Jihad for Democracy, Freedom and Women’s Rights<br>

  Author(s): Ormsby Eric<br>
  Abstract: In
      Rethinking Islam, Katajun Amirpur argues that the West's impression of Islam as a backward-looking faith, resistant to post-Enlightenment thinking, is misleading and-due to its effects on political discourse-damaging. Introducing readers to key thinkers and activists-such as Abu Zaid, a free-thinking Egyptian Qur'an scholar; Abdolkarim Soroush, an academic and former member of Khomeini's Cultural Revolution Committee; and Amina Wadud, an American feminist who was the first woman to lead the faithful in Friday Prayer-Amirpur reveals a powerful yet lesser-known tradition of inquiry and dissent within Islam, one that is committed to democracy and human rights. By examining these and many other similar figures' ideas, she reveals the many ways they reject fundamentalist assertions and instead call for a diversity of opinion, greater freedom, and equality of the sexes.<br>

Capitalism, we are told, should be refashioned as a “sustainable economy” whose growth, in the words of the United Nation’s Brundtland Commission Report, “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of FUTURE generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland 1987). Like other liberal political ideals (e.g., democracy, freedom, tolerance), the ideological work performed by sustainability is complex and multivalent.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: The principal theological issue of the period that immediately followed Luther and Trent involved the relationship between grace and freedom. This is an expression of the tension, already present throughout the Middle Ages, between a transcendent, omnipotent God, on the one hand, and created human beings, who, though fallen, search for their rightful, God-given autonomy, on the other. Three episodes are of particular interest during the period: the

  Abstract: The prestige of the Enlightenment has declined in recent years. Many consider its thinking abstract, its art and poetry uninspiring, and the assertion that it introduced a new age of freedom and progress after centuries of darkness and superstition presumptuous. In this book, an eminent scholar of modern culture shows that the Enlightenment was a more complex phenomenon than most of its detractors and advocates assume. It includes rationalist as well as antirationalist tendencies, a critique of traditional morality and religion as well as an attempt to establish them on new foundations, even the beginning of a moral renewal and a spiritual revival.<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Author(s) Alcobia-Murphy Shane<br>
  Abstract: Feminist criticism frequently employs metaphors of space to interrogate the position of women within society and their ability to articulate that position to a wider world. The idea of ‘clearing a space’ from which to speak suggests that for women freedom of expression can only be achieved in ‘empty’ space, space that is unmarked by ideological and aesthetic convictions. Yet such emptiness is impossible, since the speaking self must be meaningfully located. Space, both public and private, is closely related to the construction of identity and to its textual representation. This chapter examines the representation of the house by two<br>

  Book Title: Close Encounters-Essays on Russian Literature<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON Robert Louis<br>
  Abstract: Close Encounters: Essays on Russian Literature combines discussions of ethical, esthetic, and philosophical interest raised by Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Gorky, with close analyses of their texts. This book focuses on four thematic configurations: first (“Chance and Fate"), issues of freedom and responsibility, the necessity of free individual expression and yet the limits of will, or self-will; second (“Two Kinds of Beauty"), the unity of moral, esthetic, and spiritual categories, and the quest for the ideal; third (“Critical Perspectives"), examples of the type of commentary that approaches art with a unified ethical and spiritual perspective (Dostoevsky, Gorky, V.I. Ivanov, and the partially dissenting Bakhtin); and fourth (“Poems of Parting"), three poems (works by Tyutchev, Severyanin, and Pushkin) involving parting, loss, and recovery.<br>

  Abstract: Westphal’s reading of Hegel reveals the political nature of his own philosophy. Moreover, Westphal’s struggle with Hegel, as we shall see, can also be seen as a struggle with modernity and its resultant political, economic, and religious structures. With these thoughts in mind, Westphal’s second book on Hegel, entitled
                  Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity, is a prime source, as Westphal shapes the book to highlight these struggles, hoping to shed light upon the insights Hegel can give us and where he goes astray.

This motivation is not altogether incorrect, but perhaps there are other ways besides violence to slip out of classical constraints. Kenneth Schmitz’s philosophy of freedom is, among other things, a move away from modern violence philosophies. Yet with all his classical philosophical commitments, Schmitz is as modern a philosopher as there is, particularly regarding the modern proof of unconditioned freedom.

  Book Title: The Signifying Self-Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic<br>
  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Henry Melanie<br>
  Abstract: The Signifying Self: Cervantine Drama as Counter-Perspective Aesthetic offers a comprehensive analysis of all eight of Cervantes's Ocho comedias (published 1615), moving beyond conventional anti-Lope approaches to Cervantine dramatic practise in order to identify what, indeed, his theatre promotes. Considered on its own aesthetic terms, but also taking into account ontological and socio-cultural concerns, this study compels a re-assessment of Cervantes's drama and conflates any monolithic interpretations which do not allow for the textual interplay of contradictory and conflicting discourses which inform it. Cervantes's complex and polyvalent representation of freedom underpins such an approach; a concept which is considered to be a leitmotif of Cervantes's work but which has received scant attention with regards to his theatre. Investigation of this topic reveals not only Cervantes's rejection of established theatrical convention, but his preoccupation with the difficult relationship between the individual and the early modern Spanish world. Cervantes's comedias emerge as a counter-perspective to dominant contemporary Spanish ideologies and more orthodox artistic imaginings. Ultimately, The Signifying Self seeks to recuperate the Ocho comedias as a significant part of the Cervantine, and Golden-Age, canon and will be of interest and benefit to those scholars who work on Cervantes and indeed on early modern Spanish theatre in general.<br>

Despite the fact that the dramatist’s writings for the stage clearly flout conventional Lopean parameters, it is not indicative of a theatre which is deficient or inferior. Rather, Cervantes constructs an aesthetic which permits free expression of seditious voices and an alternative stage for those discourses normally quashed by prevailing dramatic monopoly. It is precisely because of the restrictive nature of seventeenth-century Spanish theatre that Cervantes advocates a strategy of authorial liberty. For instance, in<br>

  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts.

Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: I begin with an informal statement of three different theses concerning the relation between freedom and reason. According to the first thesis, freedom is a consequence of the subordination of the intellect to independent formal structure. One finds a version of this thesis, for example, in Plato’s
                     Sophistat 253c6ff, where dialectic, or the science of the combination and separation of forms—also referred to as division in accordance with kinds—is identified by the Eleatic Stranger and the young mathematician Theaetetus as the science that characterizes the free man.<br>

  Abstract: The Israeli Declaration of Independence promised that the State of Israel ensures complete social and political equality for its citizens, irrespective of religion, race, or sex, and guarantees freedom of religion. There is no declared official religion, and each religious community has jurisdiction over its internal affairs and matters of personal status.¹ All religious courts are recognized, autonomous, and supported by government budgets; accordingly, Israel funds more than one hundred mosques and their imams. The government also finances numerous extracurricular Islamic studies. Nevertheless, Israel’s definition as a Jewish state implies a privileged link to the faith attached to Jewishness, and<br>

  Abstract: Avicenna lived in a world rich in opportunity. After enjoying a brief era of strong central authority and cultural florescence in the first part of the 3rd/9th century, the ‘Abbâsid empire had begun to experience political decentralization. Given the enormous expanse of the empire, central control from Baghdad was unwieldy at best, and it was not long before it became politically unfeasible as well. The governing families of provinces far from the capital (Aghlabids in Ifrîqiya, Ṭûlûnids in Egypt, Ṭâhirids in Khurâsân) naturally wished to achieve the greatest possible freedom of action, and they strove toward a state in which<br>

In the quoted passage Jean-Baptiste describes the avocation he has taken up, that of a judge-penitent: one who judges others as a way of deflecting introspection and self-diagnosis in service of real reform. Innocence here assumes an almost mythical sense: It pertains not just to freedom from responsibility but also to freedom from the condition of having to be responsible. In lieu of innocence, life<br>

  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: What is the cultural identity of Europe? Are there specifically European values? Questions like these are at the centre of a considerable number of political and scholarly debates in contemporary Europe. In this international best-seller, a group of acclaimed thinkers – including Orlando Patterson, S. N. Eisenstadt, Mark Mazower and Wolfgang Schluchter – examine the most important innovations and culturally vital value traditions of Europe to produce an image of contemporary European self-understanding. The volume combines two possible approaches, examining both specific cultural traditions (‘Athens and Jerusalem’) and specific values (‘freedom’; ‘rationality’). Boasting some of the leading thinkers in Europe and edited by Hans Joas and Klaus Wiegandt, The Cultural Values of Europe will be required reading for anyone hoping to understand the common cultural ground in Europe.<br>

However, precisely because of the dangers inherent in the ‘obviousness’, in regarding the chosen subject as already known and comprehended, but also because of the inevitably changing and evolving sense of the term in the context of a lifetime’s passionate engagement, we would be wrong to think that we fully understand Sartre’s repeated working through – ‘elaboration’ in the strongest Gramscian sense – of<br>

Autonomy refers to the freedom of a society to make its own laws; control has to do with the expansion of rational mastery over the world of things, including the development of science and technology and their application to production and the control of nature (Castoriadis 1990: 15–17). Peter Wagner has developed this idea more precisely into an ‘interpretative approach’, which focuses on the responses that human beings give to certain basic

It is in the city that the various self-images of modernity (freedom, rationality, wealth), as well as the various critiques of modernity (decadence, alienation, poverty) find their exemplars. The city constitutes the focal point of many ambivalences about modern life. Still, if it is thoroughly disputed what modern urban life stands for, the dispute also evidences how the city is thought to constitute a certain way of life, to engender some or other general mode of being.

  Abstract: A fundamental mutation in the question of agency takes place between two movements, in a space that we can label the Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment divide. Literature is one of the cultural sites that embodies the consequences of this mutation. As Peter Bürger notes, there is a point at which the activity of the philosophes needs to slide from philosophical inquiry into aesthetic production to carry out the project of the autonomy of reason (1992, 8–11). Through this movement, aesthetics in general and the literary domain in particular become the site of absolute freedom in modern societies, that is, a site where<br>

Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

No one believes any longer that democracy can be reduced to a system of competitive elections culminating in majority rule. This is an important development. For two centuries the history of democracy was a history of polarization. It was as if the general will existed as a genuine force only when enshrined in a central government by way of an election.

He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure.<br>

  Abstract: Merleau-Ponty offers us an existentialist philosophy that understands our freedom and responsibility as inseparable from our embodiment. Though he does not explicitly and systematically articulate an ethics, his notion of embodiment nonetheless implies a certain existentialist ethics. For, according to Merleau-Ponty, to be embodied is to be inherently in relation to others, and thus, as I will argue, it is to be implicated in and moved by an imperative to strive for mutual recognition. This paper seeks to elucidate this embodied ethics of mutual recognition.<br>

By posing asphilosophesthey intended to stand in the name of reason, outside any considerations of religion or even of metaphysics. Unlike most of their predecessors, who usually stopped short of tackling revelation, thephilosophesopenly crossed this threshold and claimed total intellectual freedom.

  Book Title: Kierkegaard as Humanist-Discovering My Self<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Come Arnold B.<br>
  Abstract: Kierkegaard as Humanist is an extensive analysis of Kierkegaard's concepts of self, freedom, possibility, and necessity. Topics examined include the essential and continuing duality of the self, the process by which the self becomes self-consciousness, freedom as the dialectical tension between necessity and possibility and between temporality and eternity, the indeterminate/determinate leap as freedom's form, and love as freedom's content.<br>

  Abstract: We turn again to take one last look at the enigma at the heart of Kierkegaard’s entire conceptuality: the leap. In exploring the leap as the
                  formof freedom, we hedged it in by delimiting it with a series of conditions so that the leap (and hence freedom) could not be understood as arbitrary and capricious. In exploring love as thecontentof freedom, we explored an ultimate and transcendent delimitation to which the leap must submit if it is to be authentically “free.” But now the question arises whether the limits thus imposed leave any significant meaning to the<br>

  Abstract: Against the stirring spectacle of European young people leading movements for freedom and democracy in the late 1980s, it is doubly difficult to imagine how easily European regimes just a half-century earlier set about transforming their societies through a totalitarian remoulding of their young people. Yet after the terrible shocks of defeat and occupation in 1940, the newly created authoritarian government of unoccupied France undertook just such an indoctrination. Marshal Pétain declared the transformation of youth essential to France’s “National Revolution,” and earmarked revolutionized young people to be the key agents for the remaking of their peers.<br>

  Abstract: Moving away from Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism and Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, and building on his experiences as a politician, Vattimo asks if it is still possible to speak of moral imperatives, individual rights, and political freedom. Acknowledging the force of Nietzsche's "God is dead," Vattimo argues for a philosophy of pensiero debole or "weak thinking" that shows how moral values can exist without being guaranteed by an external authority. His secularising interpretation stresses anti-metaphysical elements and puts philosophy into a relationship with postmodern culture.<br>

  Abstract: I have already explored the way questions surrounding the reality and dignity of creaturely difference are inextricably linked to conceptions of the subject. While previously arguing that theological accounts of freedom and subjectivity must be cast in reference to the sovereignty of God, more must be said about the possibility of subjectivity for those made objects by normative “mankind.” In this regard, the emergence of feminist Pentecostal studies poses a sharp challenge to both systematic theology and gender studies. The experiences of Pentecostal women, often in non-Western contexts, confront common assumptions regarding women’s ritual experience and the emergence of subjectivity.<br>

  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

However, this popularizing is due not to a desire for scandal only, but, more fundamentally, to the moral mission which Sartre has assigned himself, to bring as many men as possible to an awareness of themselves and of their freedom.

On the other hand, it also addresses the ontology of political life: the basic concepts of human plurality, living in common in ordered societies, freedom, sovereignty, and the like.

Unlike love, which, on some accounts, is regarded as involuntary, friendship maintains an element of freedom of choice. In common with love, it involves a relationship between two beings and so draws us into the mystery of the difficult notion of the individual in himself or herself.

Its method was the critical deployment of “reason” and its goal was bettering the conditions of social life and expanding “freedom.”¹ No less than the Enlightenment itself, however, the liberal heritage is both underestimated and taken for granted. Often seen merely as an ideological veil for capitalist exploitation, this new political worldview legitimated the idea of “resistance” against established authority—which was already implicit within the scientific revolution initiated by Sir Francis Bacon, Galileo, and Descartes—and it gave members of<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between human rights and democracy is most often described in terms of tension (e.g., Gosepath 1998, 209ff.; Michelman 1999, 52–66; Wellmer 2000). Human rights impose on popular sovereignty moral prescriptions that restrict the freedom of choice and decision. Conversely, the results of democratic processes may run counter to the standing conceptions of human rights—and, as a result, undermine their observance.<br>

  Book Title: Radical Cosmopolitics-The Ethics and Politics of Democratic Universalism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ingram James D.<br>
  Abstract: In morality as in politics, theorists have generally focused first on discovering universal values and second on their implementation. Ingram argues that only by prioritizing the development and articulation of universal values through political action in the fight for freedom and equality can theorists do justice to these efforts and cosmopolitanism's universal vocation. Only by proceeding from the local to the global, from the bottom up rather than from the top down, on the basis of political practice rather than moral ideals, can we salvage moral and political universalism. In this book, Ingram provides the clearest, most systematic account yet of this schematic reversal and its radical possibilities.<br>

  Abstract: Existentialism is the quintessential philosophy of modernity. At the center of all existentialist thinking is the inescapably free subject who must make herself in a world bereft of meaning. Yet the obduracy of this world is determined by the limits of a circumstance that is traced by the freedom of others. I am thrown into the world, condemned to freedom, and what I encounter are always other freedoms.

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marasco Robyn<br>
  Abstract: Hegel's "highway of despair," introduced in his
         Phenomenology of Spirit, represents the tortured path traveled by "natural consciousness" on its way to freedom. Despair, the passionate residue of Hegelian critique, also indicates fugitive opportunities for freedom and preserves the principle of hope against all hope. Analyzing the works of an eclectic cast of thinkers, Robyn Marasco considers the dynamism of despair as a critical passion, reckoning with the forms of historical life forged along Hegel's highway.<br>

Even those thinkers from whom Bataille took philosophical nourishment—Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche, to name the most important—failed to exploit the richness of chance to the extent that they pinned their fortunes to projects.

  Abstract: Many observers have described Western intellectual and legal histories as moving from notions of fixed and assigned status to notions of individual freedom and rights. Sir Henry Maine’s famous dictum defined progress as the movement from status to contract.¹ Such broadly gauged summaries risk oversimplification and insensitivity to the variety and contestability of understandings of the past. Nonetheless, the contrast between legal orders premised upon status and those premised upon state-guaranteed rights helps to locate notions of abnormal persons and rights analysis as ways for dealing with differences.

  Book Title: Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Otero Solimar<br>
  Abstract: ‘Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World’ explores how Yoruba and Afro-Cuban communities moved across the Atlantic between the Americas and Africa in successive waves in the nineteenth century. In Havana, Yoruba slaves from Lagos banded together to buy their freedom and sail home to Nigeria. Once in Lagos, this Cuban repatriate community became known as the Aguda. This community built their own neighborhood that celebrated their Afrolatino heritage. For these Yoruba and Afro-Cuban diasporic populations, nostalgic constructions of family and community play the role of narrating and locating a longed-for home. By providing a link between the workings of nostalgia and the construction of home, this volume re-theorizes cultural imaginaries as a source for diasporic community reinvention. Through ethnographic fieldwork and research in folkloristics, Otero reveals that the Aguda identify strongly with their Afro-Cuban roots in contemporary times. Their fluid identity moves from Yoruba to Cuban, and back again, in a manner that illustrates the truly cyclical nature of transnational Atlantic community affiliation. Solimar Otero is assistant professor of English and folklore at Louisiana State University and is research associate and visiting professor at the Women's Studies in Religion Program at the Harvard Divinity School from 2009 - 2010.<br>

Abstract: Although his arguments could be tighter, Steffen makes some novel points. He suggests that crime, as an abuse of freedom, is appropriately punished by limitations on freedom—the greater the crime the greater (longer) the appropriate limitation. He also argues that implementation of the death penalty results in a focus on the criminal’s body, rather than on the person. This objectification, he argues, is inconsistent with the sort of respect for the criminal which is necessary for holding him responsible for his crime.<br>

Abstract: Later exegesis endowed the body of the blessed with the qualities of impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtility. All resurrected bodies will be incorruptible; but only those of the blessed will be impassible, feeling no pain or discomfort. Brightness will be their proper “glory,” and it will be proportionate to merit.
         51Agility, the capacity of moving with total freedom and celerity, represents the opposite of the terrestrial body’s weakness; it is consistent with the resurrected Christ’s capacity to pass through material objects. Subtility expresses the peculiar spirituality of a body governed by the soul but incapable, in turn, to affect it.<br>

Abstract: When Protestant Dissenters recollect the sufferings of their fathers in the last age for the freedom of their consciences, let them be thankful that their lot is cast in more settled times. The Liberties of England are the price of a great deal of blood and treasure; wide breaches were made in the constitution in the four reigns of the Male Line of the Stuarts; persecution and arbitrary power went hand in hand; the Constitution was often in convulsive Agonies, when the patrons of liberty appeared boldly in the noble cause, and sacrificed their estates and lives in its defence. The Puritans stood firm by the Protestant Religion, and by the liberties of their country in the reigns of King Charles II and King James II, and received the Fire of the Enemy from all their batteries without moving sedition, or taking advantage of their persecutors, when it was afterwards in their power.

Abstract: Braudel addressed the critics directly in
            The Mediterranean,2d ed. (1972), 2:1243–44: “The question is frequently put to me, both by historians and philosophers, if we view history from such a distance, what becomes of man, his role in history, his freedom of action?” A classic example is embodied in Braudel’s portrait of Philip II himself. “What degree of freedom was possessed by Philip II, or by Don Juan of Austria as he rode at anchor among his ships, allies, and troops? Each of these so‐called freedoms seems to me to resemble a tiny island, almost a prison.” See the conclusion of Part III, 2:1236 that recounts the death of Philip II on September 13, 1598, based on three secondary sources of the 1920s, not from contemporary accounts of Philip’s “good death.” Braudel’s last poignant paragraph suggests that Philip did not know what he was doing: “[Philip] was not a man of vision: he saw his task as an unending succession of small details. Every one of his annotations is a small precise point, whether an order, a remark, or the correction of a spelling mistake or geographical error. Never do we find general notions or grand strategies under his pen.” The king’s “grand strategy,” however, is exactly what Geoffrey Parker set out to demonstrate inThe Grand Strategy of Philip II(New Haven, Conn., 1998). Braudel may be correct that Philip, as a prince, was not a student of geography. But what Philip did study, architecture, emphasized design. No discipline was more useful to understanding “general notions or grand strategies.” Thus, Braudel’s Part III, as traditional as it is often said to be, appears to get the story and the king wrong because Braudel’s steering assumption, not Philip II, was in control: “Good reasons for us to reflect once more on the distance separating biographical history from the history of structures, and even more from the history of geographical areas” (2:1237).

Abstract: If the norm of brevity is troubled by the possibility of linguistic poverty, the weedy verbosity springing up alongside our information highways may be a misguided attempt at a remedy. These weeds are, in a way, our flowers of Parnassus. But the roots of verbosity are more complex still because they are intertwined with the other norm governing informational writing, clarity. Again, we must begin by acknowledging the ancient pedigree of clarity, but with the caveat that the concept of clarity did not mean quite the same thing after a theory of communication such as Smith’s challenged the agenda of the old rhetoric. The norm of clarity is in fact extrinsic to the development of information genres, despite the deference it is paid in these genres. It emerged as an ideal of belles lettres in the eighteenth century. For the belles lettrists—the literary critics and grammarians who dominated the public sphere of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—clarity was the supreme aim for all the genres of discourse, including the literary. Linked more to notions of
            politesseand correct usage than to knowledge or information, the center of gravity for belletrist discourse was not science but literature and journalism (forms of writing seldom distinguished at the time). The norm of clarity arose from thepublicnessof print culture, which presupposed that written communications were addressed ideally to everyone, to the hypothetical general reader. The belles lettrists thus cultivated a strong bias against terms of art, the diction that was specific to professions and crafts. Reinforced by the usual social snobbery, belles lettrist norms were from the beginning at odds with the linguistic needs of the sciences and professions, which required the freedom to devise “technical” lexicons if they were to advance at all.58Such terms of art became indispensable because these terms can be arbitrarily and therefore precisely defined. They can be forcibly removed from a domain ~<br>

Abstract: McNay’s
      Gender and Agency, while differing fromGender in the Mirrorin focus, shares in Meyers’s vexation with existing approaches to agency. McNay is particularly suspicious of theorists of cultural studies who “impute to certain everyday practices a kind of inherently subversive status” (4). She argues that the widely deployed idea of everyday resistance has no impact when the interplay between individual behavior and social norms is ignored: “This, in turn, indicates the necessity of contextualizing agencywithin power relationsin order to understand how acts deemed as resistant may transcend their immediate sphere in order to transform collective behavior and norms” (4, emphasis added). One can see that McNay is explicitly conscious of the tension that lurks in Meyers’s work, and the point is repeated throughout the book: “Analysis of the way in which certain subversive practices may get taken up and collectivized is important if resistance is to mean anything other than the truism that individuals do not reproduce social norms in a straightforward fashion” (129). Yet even more than Meyers’s, McNay’s argument glides from the language of mandate in her proposals (analogous to Meyers’s “musts”) to the language of possibility and potential in the results: a new theory of contextualized feminist agency could, may, might lead to collective action and greater freedom for women.<br>

Abstract: Opposition to this tradition comes from those philosophers and scientists who take individual or social consciousness as their primary reference point; their aim is to explain the realm of nature as a mental, cultural, or spiritual construct. They do not accept the ontological implications of the scientific view of the world at face value, and they are usually dismissed by their opponents as idealists. According to Gare, this tradition includes George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, G. W. F. Hegel, theorists of hermeneutics, neo‐Kantians, Hegelian Marxists, and some of the pragmatists, phenomenologists, and ordinary language philosophers [
         5]. Being a much less coherent tradition of thought than scientific materialism, this tradition tends to divide itself; on the one hand, there are those who assume that consciousness is individual or transcendental and those who argue that it is essentially social, cultural, or spiritual. On the other hand, there are those who assume that consciousness is contemplative, as well as those who insist that praxis precedes reflective or theoretical thinking. But, according to Gare, “what all such thinkers have in common is a refusal to be bound by the categories of reductionist science and a determination to do justice to the creativity and freedom of consciousness” [5, p. 4].<br>

Abstract: Given the absence of comprehensively universal standards of evaluation for recognition of worth, then, religious communities seem to be caught between the horns of a dilemma: the need for their mutual recognition of worth for the sake of greater solidarity within the present postcolonial‐neocolonial context, on the one hand, and the necessity of evaluation from their parochial yet inescapably universalized points of view, on the other. Yet this dilemma may not be an irresolvable contradiction. First of all, the notion of recognition on demand is incompatible with the practice of mutual recognition as such insofar as there are cultural practices that do not honor mutuality and reciprocity. In other words, mutual recognition of free participatory agency itself provides a minimum universal standard for mutual recognition of worth in the sense that the former by definition precludes recognizing the worth of a community’s particular practices that seek to dominate, marginalize, and exclude from participation other communities as well as some of its own members. Nancy Fraser’s thesis that the standard of recognition must be the norm of participatory parity is helpful in explicating this point: a community claiming recognition of worth for its religious or cultural practices must show that these practices neither impede the free and equal participation of other communities and their members in the common space of living nor bar some of its own members from being free participants in its internal life with the power to define and represent it.
         29Any communal practice that upholds the master‐slave relation as a key value and organizing principle around which the community attempts to structure its internal life and external relations must be denied recognition of worth by virtue of its own rejection of the values of reciprocity and participatory freedom intrinsic to the practice of mutual recognition.<br>

Abstract: What is particularly intriguing here is Frei’s connection between the “particularistic” practices of reading represented by Midrash and the “cultural future” of civilization. Adherence to the literal sense, through typological practices of reading, thus cultivates a practice and informs a worldview that can resist and challenge the universal, hegemonic tendencies of modernity. As he continues, “The Protestant theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher called Judaism a fossil religion, in part at least out of the animus which many Rationalist, Romantic, and Idealistic thinkers bore toward Jewish particularism. And yet it is now conceivable that that `fossil' may bear more of the future of the culture of the West in its hands than Christianity, and its traditional, particularistic forms may not be adventitious to the fact.” The “fossilization” of Judaism from the perspective of the Enlightenment is well known; moreover, the rejection of Jewish particularism by Rationalism, Romanticism, and Idealism bears a strong resemblance to the simultaneous occlusion of the practice of figural reading so powerfully described in
         Eclipse: “Beyond that, however, the example of Judaism in the modern Western world might be a beacon to a reconstituted Christian community. One never knows what this community might then contribute once again to that culture or its residues, including its political life, its quest for justice and freedom—and even its literature. If the priorities are rightly ordered, the literal sense may be counted on to play a significant part in such a less pretentious enterprise. It will stretch and not break.” As Frei notes, such cultural benefits must be considered “secondary” or “incidental”—yet, this paragraph speaks volumes as to the potentially transformative impact that he envisages through adherence to the literal sense of scripture and attention to its relation to Midrash. Such potential is highly significant, given Frei’s frequent disparagement of allegoric~<br>

Abstract: By contrast, those who on the day of September 11 and in the weeks and months thereafter sought explanations for the attacks amidst human affairs, in the role the United States has played in the Middle East, in international affairs, the oil business, or global geopolitics, as examples, might be characterized as humanistically driven.
         23While they may well be religious, they tend not to be fundamentalist in their outlooks. Such questioners, while no less certain of their dominant narratives, are nonetheless able, as was Mr. Zee, to revisit them when faced with overwhelming evidence to the contrary. While the left has no dearth of ideologues, in other words, their ideology is not bound inexorably to theology,24which allows for the possibility that history can move according to the ideals of “freedom and progress” or in discord with them. No path is preordained. Furthermore, by virtue of believing in human agency, regardless of how compromised by institutional structures, adherents of this worldview at least preach the importance of acting in the world to promote its salvation rather than relying on belief in Jesus to guarantee their own. The two groups, thus, are opposed, and the conflict between their systems of logic are intractable, bearing heavy consequences for public schooling and for democracy writ large.25<br>

Author(s): van der Ven Johannes A.<br>
Abstract: By way of summary: in this article I have argued that interreligious interaction, first of all, should be approached from an observer perspective and, hence, should be placed in an intercivilization context in which human rights can function as a directive for the application of the principles of human dignity, freedom, and equality—all principles that relate to respect and tolerance. This links up with the notion of pluralism in theology of religions. In this context interreligious dialogue can fulfil an important function if it meets three conditions: information exchange in the form of mutual witnessing; perspective exchange, with all the attendant problems; and perspective coordination. Close analysis of this kind of interreligious dialogue reveals two kinds of perspective exchange: that of self‐perspective and other perspective, and that of observer and participant perspective. Here human rights once more act as a criterion: a criterion of truth and justice. This is my attempt at explaining why young people, in test samples of empirical theological research done on different continents, assign pluralism priority over all other approaches, including interreligious dialogue.<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: The fact that the destruction of the mausoleum came not as a spontaneous act on the heels of a popular upheaval at the time of the “velvet revolution” but as a hastily organized and sloppily executed performance a full decade after “the changes” contributed, of course, to the general indifference to the fate of this particular site, despite the emotional pathos of some of the articulated opinions. Most important, it explains the richness and diversity of nuanced assessments as well as the complete freedom of their expression. Indeed, if the demolition had taken place in the fall of 1989 or even at the beginning of 1990, one would be tempted to make sense of it in the framework of revolutionary struggles over meaning.
         92The destruction of the Vendôme Column on May 16, 1871, came two and a half weeks after the proclamation of the Commune. It was a highly theatricalized spectacle, with a crowd of over twenty thousand assembled, waiting for three hours while a brass band played “La Marseillaise.”93In contrast, the 1999 mausoleum spectacle was a poorly staged mimicry of a revolutionary act, minus the music, minus the public, exactly ten years after the triggering event—a mimicry that raised again all the conceptual questions of how exactly the original event of 1989 should be designated and assessed. Should it be called a revolution (even if a “velvet” one), thus focusing on its quality of rupture? Or should it be seen as an internal coup that, despite denoting a break, emphasizes the agents' continuity? Or can its significance best be captured by the innocuous and meaningless term “changes,” which, however, has in its favor the fact that it has become the preferred and most widely utilized expression by the public, no matter what their political preferences, and has thus withstood the withering effects of time?<br>

Abstract: The creative moral capability is ultimately best imagined through the strange language of myth. Myth can simultaneously capture the narrative thickness of actual social dynamics yet also press it toward its own more primordial creative possibilities. Myth arises out of and subjects to critique particular historical conditions. Moral creativity is more concretely imagined the more its mythologization—as, for example, in McFague’s all‐embracing Motherhood—disrupts and transforms present history in a freshly inclusive way. The symbolism of a kingdom of God, by contrast, may now imply such hierarchical social domination that it can no longer function well as a symbol of the hoped‐for new human community. Gustavo Gutiérrez offers still another possibility of the symbolism of “creative freedom” through “work”: “Humankind is created in the image and likeness of God and … fulfills itself only by transforming nature and thus entering into relationships with other persons. Only in this way do persons come to a full consciousness of themselves as subjects of creative freedom which is realized through work.”
         38In whatever form, such moral myths are themselves on some level all‐too‐human creations. Even the myth of the Creator Mother can transform human society only so far. Nevertheless, the value of myth for moral practice and thought lies precisely in its capacity for opening and transforming moral life. It can provoke our easily lost yet always also available faculty for creating together a more profoundly humanized social world.<br>

Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: A genuine atmosphere of deliberation requires three principles: “The basic premise of reciprocity is that citizens owe one another justifications for the institutions, laws, and public policies that collectively bind them. … Together with reciprocity, two other principles specify the conditions of democratic deliberation. The principle of publicity requires that reason‐giving be public in order that it may be mutually justifiable. The principle of accountability specifies that officials who make decisions on behalf of other people, whether or not they are electoral constituents, should be accountable to those people” [
      34, pp. 133, 135]. Within the framework of rights (encompassing justice as fairness) and the process of deliberation according to a discourse ethical approach, librarianship can be better able to address the difficult issues it faces. The reality of pluralism necessitates both rights and deliberation. Deliberation, as a process, cannot help but be dialectical. As has been shown here, there are differing conceptions of right and good, of intellectual freedom and censorship, even of ethical theories. To at least some extent, the discussion and controversy surrounding these issues are antinomies, contradictions between statements that each has reasonable grounds. Dialectics, as a means of resolving contradictions and reconciling division, has its foundations in Hegel. Steven Smith ably summarizes the key elements of a dialectical approach:
               It is by such an approach that we, as a profession, can arrive at a fully formed practical and normative ethics. It would be fruitless to ignore the divisions and disagreements; they must be addressed dialogically. Further, the dialogue is inescapably phenomenological (as described above) in that legitimacy, which includes beliefs and voice, must be assumed by all, with regard to all. The foregoing is an attempt to further the dialogue.Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. ~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Patočka holds that it is only in Christianity that the most powerful plumbing of the depths of responsibility has occurred—in other words, that only here is it conceived in a truly fundamental manner. He can do so because this conception of responsibility articulates, as it were, the only conditions under which responsibility is possible. In Christianity alone, it becomes clear that “responsibility demands irreplaceable singularity” (
      GD,p. 51). Christian responsibility is also, therefore, tied to a gift of death—of “another death” (GD,p. 40), which is not the one to be found in the Platonic version of the care of the soul. As Derrida reminds us, when Patočka argues that “themysterium tremendumannounces, in a manner of speaking,another death.…another way of giving death or of granting oneself death,” “the word ‘gift’ is uttered” (GD,p. 40). This gift of death is a gift in an eminent sense. It is the gift by the other on which the gift of responsibility itself rests or with which responsibility coincides. Only through this gift of death does access to genuine responsibility become possible because “only death or rather the apprehension of death can give this irreplaceability [without which there can be no true responsibility], for it is only on the basis of it that one can speak of a responsible subject, of the soul as conscience of self, of myself, etc.” (GD,p. 51; trans. mod.). This gift is another way of giving oneself death, first and foremost, in the sense of apprehending death. In the originary Platonic version of the care of the soul, the philosopher, by giving himself death as that which will only affect him as a bodily being, frees himself from death; he collects and gathers himself within himself. Derrida writes that the (philosopher’s) self “comes into beingas suchat the moment when the soul is not only gathering itself in the preparation for death but when it is ready to receive death, giving it to itself even, in an acceptation that delivers it fro~<br>

Abstract: Finally, in
      Moral CreativityWall carries out a dialogue with a wide variety of contemporary philosophical and theological voices, including narrative theology, recent Aristotelianisms, feminism, liberation theology, communicative ethics, and others. Often, the intent is to show how the voice captures only one side of the tension between freedom and finitude. Ricoeur, with his passive/active model of selfhood, is presented as the corrective to such one‐sided accounts. In fact, one of the great virtues of the book is the fact that it makes Ricoeur’s voluminous writings available to the debates of contemporary ethics in an accessible way. Wall’s original reflections on contemporary ethical thought are clear‐eyed as well, particularly some of his comments on the status of evil in narrative theology.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Not surprisingly, given its overt presence in the JST account of the garden, the nature of evil and its consequences is a large theme in Smith’s account of the world’s first family. Particular care is taken to reiterate Lucifer’s motives to implement his own plan at the expense of God’s. The reader is told that Lucifer, now the cast‐down Satan, “sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the mind of God; wherefore he sought to destroy the world.”
         57Here, to Lucifer’s grandiosity and rebellion is added the additional problem of ignorance, that is, he knows not “the mind of God.” Thus, in the JST version of the garden, as at the council, Satan is displaying not only malice but also a fundamental misunderstanding of the way life works, when he prompts the serpent to argue, consistent with the KJV: “Ye shall not die … ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”58With the council narrative as background, the JST reader sees Satan’s approach has not changed and neither has the substance of his offer: death masquerading as power. Evil is rebellion against God’s plan and the embracing of its opposite: the voluntary or free adoption of an antiorder that seeks to destroy human freedom in order to obtain power as an end in itself. It is Lucifer, not the fallen Eve or Adam, who conveys the definition of sin and defines it in terms of rebellion as a lust for power obtained at the expense of agency and, thus, life itself. Stated as an abstract principle, it is obvious that this characterization of Satan and his goal are not original to the JST. As Ecclesiastes tells us, there is nothing new under the sun; particularly the religious sun. I do not dispute him. My point here is the manner in which this principle is historicized or realized for the reader by its conveyance through narrative and, more especially, the authorized biblical plot rather than a separate narrative.<br>

Abstract: In other areas of library practice, King and Rubin [
            11] and Gary P. Radford [7] viewedtruth, along with the termsjusticeandbeauty, as one of three “interrelated fundamental ideals that serve as the foundation for librarianship in general and reference services in particular” [11, p. 249]. King and Rubin argued that these three terms form a conceptual basis from which to understand the public purpose of librarianship, particularly as it applies to reference service, within the larger milieu of democratic idealism. The idea of truth in this context forms the basis for understanding issues of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression, where the library serves as the penultimate setting for the free exchange of opinions, beliefs, and ideas. King and Rubin proposed that the existence of “untruths” is also important to the philosophy of service in librarianship because untruths, as described by John Swan [33], can “stimulate thinking and reveal pathways in the search for truth” [11, p. 251]. Embracing the concepts of truth and untruth in librarianship is foundational because they support and promote the Jeffersonian vision of an enlightened marketplace of ideas. Specific provisions within the Library Bill of Rights and other official policies of the American Library Association are cited by King and Rubin to demonstrate the practical expressions of these ideals.<br>

Author(s): Bender Thomas<br>
Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Abstract: Augustine would add that our affections are not merely individualistic; they are intersubjective and attach themselves to political and collective goods (among other shareable values). We “feel together” in ways that led Augustine to be keenly attentive to the moral quality of his friendships as well as to matters that bear on a common life. “The life of a city is inevitably a social life,” he writes.
         52He expressed these ideas most famously in his account of what constitutes a people. For Augustine, we understand a “people” to be an “association of rational beings united by a common agreement on the objects of their love.”53Unity is experienced dialogically and intersubjectively, for which love and desire provide the social glue. Hence the fact that citizens in the res publica justifiably share a worry about injury to their attachments when injustice occurs: their common goods, cherished traditions, and political values. For Augustine, these goods are legitimate objects of attachment insofar as they furnish essential conditions of creative freedom.<br>

Abstract: The remembrance of death and the love of life, which I have explored today, are in fact etched into the structures of our everyday, lived reality. Forty years ago this week, riots broke out at Columbia University and other institutions of higher learning and then, in May, throughout the United States and Europe over the war in Vietnam. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot. We are still at war but now on a global scale. And the killing of the just and innocent continues. Years ago some farsighted people grasped the massive danger we posed to our planet’s environment and forms of life, and we this week celebrate Earth Week in order to counter that danger. The past months have been scarred by an onslaught of murders in our city, especially against children. The remembrance of death surrounds us. Yet this week is also one of freedom and life. Jews around the world during Passover look back and reenact those events that led to their liberation from bondage. Christians look forward to Pentecost and the rush of new life in the spirit. Other religions also celebrate life in its many forms. People of good will around the world struggle against the onslaught of poverty, oppression, and dehumanization in the name of human dignity and also the fragile goodness of finite life.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In making the language of prayer catachrestic, he is once more reinscribing a theme from the tradition, but more forcefully and centrally than his predecessors. Calvin had written, “God tolerates even our stammering and pardons our ignorance … as indeed without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray.”
         46Yet, classically, if there had been an epistemological problem in prayer, it was not about humanity’s knowledge of God (“the transcendency of religious Intuitions”) but rather about God’s knowledge of humanity: why pray, if God already knows what you are going to tell him? Equally, the focus on the Lord’s Prayer tended to mean that the language of prayer was a priori appropriate, even if Luther noted that its initial petitions were “Hebraically expressed,” that is, concerning spiritual mysteries.47However, catachresis is in keeping with the tenor of Coleridge’s thought: the “I” against itself, the limit of human reason against itself, unbelief against itself, language against itself.<br>

Abstract: Gauchet's is a decidedly “political history of religion” that attaches paramount importance to the state. The rise of this “sacral transforming agent” imposed the otherness that once characterized the gods of the first religions on and in society. As a result, the divine appeared ever more remote as an “organizing principle,” and humans were left in a position to “reappropriate” the world. This theologico-political transformation ushered in a long procession of events culminating in the emergence of Christianity, the religion that functioned as a theological conduit for departing from religion. The final act of Gauchet's passion play of the sacred unfolds during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the Protestant and Catholic Reformations and the rise of political absolutism; the former enshrined the freedom of the conscience, while the latter completed the process of cleaving the terrestrial from the divine sphere. Ultimately, individuals came to assert themselves in the void left by a transcendent divinity: “God's greatness, taken to the highest level, puts humans on an equal footing with the mystery of creation and validates their independence as cognitive subjects.” The appearance of the modern individual and the modern state signaled the completion of what Gauchet calls a “revolution in transcendence,” predicated on human reoccupation of the space once entirely controlled by the divine. Nevertheless, the self's past alienation from its origins was not simply overcome but instead transferred to psychological, social, and political dualities that persist both within and among individual selves. As Gauchet observes, “Leaving religion is not like waking from a dream. We originated in religion, we continue to explain ourselves through it, and always will.”

Abstract: But even when the token is received in trust, there is no debt created since the final gift has not yet arrived. One might feel obligation in anticipation of the gift, but such obligation differs from that in which a gift would actually have been received rather than a gift one might receive. Because of the translation of obligation into the future, it opens up a space for exchange without debt. One can take this token in trust and then offer gratitude in return to God without debt, without obligation in freedom. Derrida constructed the pure gift in order to preserve it from exchange and reciprocity. He did not thereby think that the gift so purified would not affect the world of exchange, forever hovering aloft. Rather, his preferred way of describing the gift is as an interruption, a trace, or cinders that would in some oblique or indirect way haunt or challenge the ordinary economy. By contrast, because the giving of the promise indebts God to the one promised in some sense, this token and final gift enters into the already existing exchange of gifts in human culture or the political sphere. Derrida’s gift, in some of its formulations, could silence immanent political criticism. Tillich feared that aphasia in the political was the consequence of dialectical theology when it refused to allow God to interact with the world for fear of tainting God’s wholly otherness. This refusal would prevent the token offered in promise, as well as the one promised, from entering into the give‐and‐take of life with the token in hand or the trust of the word, even though it can radically challenge by its interruption of gift economy.<br>

Abstract: Another approach is referred to by Joel Robbins (
         2004,2007) as “anthropology of morality” and by Jarrett Zigon (2007,2008) as “anthropology of moralities.” Robbins is concerned with the contrast between the routine reproduction of moral regimes in stable societies and the enforced freedom of moral choice in situations of value conflict produced by social change, whereas Zigon emphasizes the interpersonal level in which taken-for-granted moral life breaks down and must be restored by self-conscious ethical work. Working at a relatively more macrolevel scale, Robbins has an implicit typology contrasting the moral comfort of social stability with the moral effervescence of social change, while Zigon describes a social process in which moral comfort is disrupted by the liminality of ethical questioning and reinstated if that process is successful.<br>

Abstract: Peperzak critiques the self-image of philosophy as “strictly autonomous thought, in the strong, wholly independent, and autarkic sense of this word” (129). Philosophy in this, typically modern, mold starts with a laudable commitment to freedom but ends up “obsessed by the sovereign position of an ego on top of a panoramic universe” (156) and coldly abstracted from the particularities of individual thinkers, its discourse closed off from relation to others.<br>

Abstract: Accountability for one's actions has been a major theme that literary artists have grappled with over the centuries. Among the works in which it plays a significant role, and which are here analyzed, are the Oedipus trilogy, Hamlet, The Brothers Karamazov, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Trial, The Stranger, and three twentieth-century American novels: An American Tragedy, Light in August, and Native Son. Insights into the dark recesses of the human mind, which can complement the insights of legal philosophers and social scientists, are revealed in these and other works. They point to an argument that prophesy is not immutable destiny and that social causation is not social determinism. The human being achieves freedom by acceptance of responsibility, each man for his own acts, each woman for hers.<br>

Author(s): Young Aaron<br>
Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Abstract: Michel Foucault in "Revolutionary Action: 'Until Now' " (an interview),
Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: "By humanism I mean the totality of discourse
through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can
still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more
you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty,' Human-
ism invented a whole series of subjected sovereignties: the soul (ruling the body, but
subjected to God), consciousness (sovereign in a context ofjudgment, but subjected to
the necessities of truth), the individual (a titular control of personal rights subjected to
the laws of nature and society), basic freedom (sovereign within, but accepting the
demands of an outside world and 'aligned with destiny'). In short, humanism is
everything in Western civilization that restricts the desirefor power ..." (221 )<br>

Article Title: The First Evil Will Must Be Incomprehensible: A Critique of Augustine<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263713<br>
Date: 9 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Teselle Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The thesis of this paper is that an absolute origin of evil, arising from the free will of a creature, must be incomprehensible. Although Augustine occasionally acknowledges this point, nevertheless in a number of better-known passages (chiefly in The City of God) he attempts to give a causal account of the fall of Adam and/or Satan. Much of the subsequent Christian tradition has unfortunately followed his lead, and major recent commentators routinely ignore or passively approve of his conceptual error. Augustine offers three unacceptable explanations of the fall, which conflict variously with his own doctrines of divine omnipotence, the goodness of creation, and creaturely free will and responsibility, as well as violating the canons of sound argumentation and explanation. First, his contention that free creatures made "out of nothing" inevitably fall makes the fall seem ontologically necessary (unfree) and thereby lays the ultimate responsibility for it on the Creator. Second, the appeal to pride as an explanation is a spurious causal account, for "pride" is only a synonym for "fallenness" itself and not a possible antecedent condition in a being created good and not yet fallen. Finally, his assertion that the first sin is intrinsically comprehensible, but not comprehensible to us because we are fallen, is an obfuscation masquerading as an explanation, for we have no warrant for supposing that this assertion is true or even meaningful. Instead of seeking causal explanation Augustine should have stayed with his own wiser observation that an evil will has no efficient cause. Theology of the Augustinian sort (which comprises much of the Christian tradition) ought to concede that the fall as a work of genuine freedom is an absurd "fact," an incomprehensible given which steadfastly and in principle resists causal explanation. The concluding section of the paper draws upon Ricoeur's insights to tell why the narrative structure of the "Adamic myth" (which has important p~<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: The significance of the conception of the "I" as an "integral ego", which is fundamental to Ricoeur's thought, is brought out. The "integral ego" forms the basis of an analysis of the relations between the voluntary and involuntary in human action and enables these relations to be seen and comperehended from a fresh perspective. The "integral ego" is conceived as an organic unity of the "Cartesian cogito" and the existent body. This necessitates a view of the body as a Corps propre in Merleau-Ponty's sense; "a-body-moved-by-the-will", a conscious body, imbued with meaning. The body is on no account to be regarded as a mere physical object related to other physical objects in a mechanical causal chain. There is no place in man for the Cartesian dualism between thinking substance and extended substance. Although Ricoeur's method in analysing these relations is one of pure or "eidetic" description, he, in contradistinction to Husserl, attempts to integrate the body, as a Corps propre, with the cogito. He repeatedly stresses the danger of naturalizing the cogito; of viewing psychic processes as natural facts and the body as an empirical object. The rigorous phenomenological description clarifies the inter-relation and reciprocity between the voluntary and involuntary—whether in human decision, physical action or consent. The voluntary (the project, the moving of the body and consent) is based on and nourished by the involuntary (motives and given values; body, emotions and habits; character, sub-conscious and life). On the other hand, the involuntary has meaning only within the harmonious synthesis of human action. This analysis enables Ricoeur to refute various traditional explanations of human action. Both deterministic and irrationalistic interpretations distort and misinterpret the place and meaning of the components of human action because of an inadequate representation of man's nature. Determinism is wrong in regarding consciousness as a fact of nature and in con~<br>

Abstract: This article studies the institutional context of recent reforms in ecclesiastical faculties, with special attention to the transformation of modern Universities. Four major problems are raised in this period of University renewal. 1) Should Universities stress research or teaching functions? 2) Should they admit the mass of students or be reserved to an elite? 3) How can they organize efficiently the University community? 4) What is their responsibility towards the collectivity? With regard to the first question, the author notes the current emphasis on research as compared to teaching. A reasonable balance between these two functions may be attained by drawing from philosophies of education within the English, French, German and American traditions. A rewarding survey of recent University legislation in various countries is made. The post-industrial era calls for a stress on research in such a way as to link it more effectively with the teaching function of the University. As to the second question, youth today assumes its right to a University education. Universities can neither receive all candidates nor, on the other hand, systematically impose a « numerus clausus ». Selectivity is necessary. A system of diversified Colleges, Universities and Faculties would permit everyone with the prerequisite aptitudes to receive a University training. Planning would be necessary among the institutions of a given region. A system of gradual and qualified selection is suggested. The third problem concerns the University as a community. Recent reforms require effective collaboration among all the components of the University: administrators, professors, students. All should have some voice in university government. More important than structures is the mentality which will effect a genuine solidarity and consensus among all members of the University community. The fourth problem regards the University's relationship to the collectivity. The University must protect its academic~<br>

Author(s): Magnani Giovanni<br>
Abstract: Freud's metapsychology, although it is not identical with the whole field of psychoanalytic psychology, originated under the controlling influence of a questionable positivistic model of science. The analysis begun in a previous study (Gregorianum, 61 [1980] 97-136) continues in this study of the relationship in Freud's thought between theory and empirical observation. We also treat the attempts by Freud and by the later neopositivist schools of classical ego-theory to articulate psychoanalytic insights about the person in terms taken from neurophysiology, biology, and classical mechanics. Such terms pervade the terminology used to express the metapsychological viewpoints, albeit in disharmonious juxtaposition with more specifically psychological terms. Freud's whole work was affected by his desire to propose psychoanalysis as a natural science on the model of the positivistic outlook of late nineteenth century Viennese physicalism. Opposition arose in the 1950s and 1960s to understanding psychoanalysis as a natural science, especially because of problems of conceptual definition, language, and verification or validation. Orthodox Freudians themselves were troubled by the problem of psychic energy and the discussion finally led to critical doubts about Freud's whole metapsychology. One reason was the dependence on a physical and mechanical model of science and on a neurophysiology no longer tenable. Other frames of reference in the exact sciences were sought, such as cybernetics and information theory, in an attempt to remain to some extent in harmony with the original epistemological ideology. There are those today who remain convinced that psychoanalysis is an exact science, and who in turn reject the different psychologies of understanding and the hermeneutical sciences. In the context of a basic-level discussion, this contribution explores, in their context, the principles of the worldview found at the most theoretical level of metapsychology. Among these, the p~<br>

Abstract: Going beyond the passing theological fashions, the article seeks to show the relevance of "narrative theology". It first illustrates its doctrinal foundation in the many narratives which provide the frame-work for the biblical books, in the narrative of the Creed itself, in the ancient theologies of salvation history, down to the rediscovery of "narrativity" in contemporary theology. It then seeks to throw light on the philosophical foundation of narrative theology relying on Gaston Fessard's reflexion on three histories, natural, human and supernatural, and of Paul Ricoeur on Temps et récit (Time and Narrative), history and narrative, narrative and freedom. It ends up with a pastoral anthropology of narrative which seeks the link and meeting-point between the narrative of salvation and our own stories.<br>

Abstract: Biblical texts make demands which the reader cannot refrain from answering. In giving an answer, the reader should dare to say more than the text has already said and to take responsibility for this. This biblical demand forces us to understand by ourselves and does not offer the possibility of referring to something that is already understood. To understand a biblical text, one must therefore take the risk of misunderstanding. In view of this precarious freedom, the author shows that hermeneutical research is necessary in order to avoid accidents in understanding. We first see a text, then we read it and finally understand it by creating a "text world". Thus we can misunderstand a text if we don't see or read it correctly or if we miss the essence of the text. Any research on misunderstanding texts would have to deal with the relationship between the reader's own understanding and that which is not the reader's own. Understanding is not only what we understand, nor is it only understanding that which is foreign to us in a text, it is always both.<br>

Abstract: We can distinguish two different kinds in the educational process, the one called «learning education» and the one leading to a possible «autonomous education» in which every-body's freedom is above everything else. The former is education for technoscientists. The later, the «autonomous education» is supported by the thesis that knowing oneself as «moriturus», forces one to provide a sense or meaning, technologies and educational sciencies not being enough. Death forces us to decide the possible, only opposed by the impossible.<br>

Publisher: Faculty of Education The University of Calgary<br>
Issue: i23761698<br>
Date: 4 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Blumenfeld-Jones Donald S.<br>
Abstract: Classroom discipline systems are considered as patriarchal moral systems focused on hyper-individuality and dependent upon rules, consequences, and principles focused through authoritarian structures. Three example systems (Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, and Discipline with Dignity) are critiqued using Noddings' analysis of evil and Welch's liberation theology. As an alternative grounding, freedom of responsibility is proposed, moved foward through Noddings' mediation and care and Welch's dangerous memory and solidarity with oppressed peoples. Les différentes approches à la discipline dans la salle de classe sont considérés comme des systèmes patriarcaux et moraux qui ont pour but de brimer l'individualité. Ces systèmes ont également comme bases des règlements, des conséquences et des principes imposés par des structures autoritaires. A la lumière de l'analyse de Nodding sur le mal et de la théologie de la libération de Welch, nous critiquons trois systèmes de discipline: "Assertive Discipline, Glasser's Control Theory, Discipline with Dignity." Comme alternative nous proposons plutôt une approche dite "liberté responsable" qui s'inspire des concepts de médiation et de soin de Nodding et des concepts de mémoire dangereuse et de solidarité des opprimés de Welch.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880901<br>
Date: 3 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): PATRICK MORAG<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Wright Dale S.<br>
Abstract: Mandala is a Korean film that follows the careers of two Buddhist monks who pursue antithetical forms of religious practice—meditative selfcultivation, and antinomian pursuit of freedom. Mandala culminates in the enlightenment of both, as they come to realize the limits intrinsic in self-absorption in either form. The paper seeks to explore the larger ethical issues posed in the film in relation to their background in Mahayana Buddhism and to show their applicability in our own cultural setting to the emergence of a 'theological humanism', which articulates various forms of transcendence or depth experienced in the midst of human life.<br>

Article Title: OUT OF THE NON-READING GAOL: VALENTINE CUNNINGHAM, HELEN KELLER, AND HERMENEUTIC FREEDOM<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Mills Kevin<br>
Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Abstract: The proponent of the repeal measure, Leonardo Emo, asserted that the dowry limitation law
had produced 'diminutione honoris et libertatis huius civitatis' ('a reduction of the honour and
liberty of this city') because all Venetians were now 'de sua libertate privatos' ('deprived of their
freedom'). He urged repeal in order that 'omnes cives et fideles nostri' ('all citizens and loyal
subjects') might be restored to 'sua solita libertate in facta nuptiarum et dotium' ('their customary
freedom in matters regarding marriage and dowries'). ASV, Senato, 'Misti', Reg. 53, fol. 94v (30
December 1420). The repeal attempt was defeated by 73 nay votes against 45 yeas, with 8 absten-
sions. The act threatening a fine of 1000 ducats for proponents or supportors of further repeal efforts
was passed immediately after the defeat of the repeal proposal.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24572645<br>
Date: 9 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hlongwane Gugu<br>
Abstract: This article offers an examination of Lee Hirsch's Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony. Beginning with the liberation songs that gained salience during the National Party's implementation of apartheid policy in 1948 and ending with the struggle songs of a post-1994 democratic South Africa, the documentary's aim is to retrieve and recount the role of freedom songs in antiapartheid struggle. Using the writings of Ernesto Laclau, John Mbiti, Paul Ricoeur, and Alfred Schutz, this essay will argue that liberation songs are ancestral text that were partly used by antiapartheid activists to create their collective identities. This essay will further argue that Amandla! set itself the task of retrieving South Africa's liberation songs and liberation's praise singers from the ancestral region John Mbiti calls Zamani to a region he calls Sasa. However, this essay will assert that the ancestral retrieval task of this documentary is compromised by the documentary's privileging of the hegemonic groups within the African National Congress (ANC), the documentary's presentation of the ANC as a monolithic and univocal organization, and the producer's snowball sampling method. Arguing that this documentary relegates some of the South African struggle experiences into Zamani, this essay will attempt to correct these omissions and broaden the context of liberation songs.<br>

Abstract: See Ricoeur in the essay mentioned in note 33 on the transition from 'sub-
ject' to 'structure' in Althusser's works: 'Zugleich wird damit die Wachsamkeit
gegenüber Verifizierung und Falsifizierung geschwàcht' (p. 208). Openness on this
point cannot, in my opinion, be expected until followers of Althusser show a
readiness to abandon the disastrous notion that the appealing, interpellating
^uthority which demands accountibility can be no other than Ideology. See for
instance Althusser, 'Ideologie en ideologische staatsapparaten' ('Ideology and
ideological state apparatuses'), in Te elfder ure (At the eleventh hour), 24 (1978,
no. 1), pp. 99f: 'the individual is addressed as a (free) subject, so that it subjects
itself in freedom to the commandments of the Subject' (100), '... the ideology
brings about simultaneously (1) the addressing of the 'individuals' as subjects; (2)
their subjection to the Subject' (99).<br>

Abstract: Pannenberg, as we have noted, deals with the contradictions involved by making the
tension between egocentricity and exocentricity the ontic nature of humanness. Simul-
taneously exocentricity both validates and invalidates egocentricity. "But even if human
beings are in this sense sinners by nature, this does not mean that their nature as human
beings is sinful" (p. 107). The cardinal question is whether such a coincidentia oppositorum is
able to do full justice to creaturely goodness, human freedom and responsibility. See Brian
Walsh, "A Critical Review of Pannenberg's Anthropology in Theological Perspective" in Christian
Scholar's Review XV (1986), 247-259.<br>

Abstract: Transparency is one of Kierkegaard's favorite terms to indicate that a person's freedom is

transparency (cf. Kierkegaard 1848). For my own account of this non-transparency (I use the
term speechlessness), see Glas (in press).<br>

Article Title: O Mal e a Metamorfose em Machado de Assis<br>
Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: Los historiadores porfían en encontrar la verdad y defender la libertad de interpretarla. Las diversas «verdades» conllevan la construcción permanente de la historia, para lo cual nos vemos en la necesidad de insistir en la inagotable búsqueda de los rastros y restos del pasado. Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

J. Monahan défend l'intellectualisme de Buridan, que Jerzy Korolec et Risto Saarinen
optent pour la position du compromis entre intellectualisme et volontarisme, très récem-
ment Jack Zupko défend à nouveau l'intellectualisme de Buridan. Pour les différentes
positions, voir respectivement E. J. MONAHAN, «Human Liberty and Free Will according
to John Buridan», in: Mediaeval Studies 16 (1954), p. 72-86, ici p. 84: «Buridans doc-
trine of human liberty of choice belongs to this intellectualist tradition». L'article est issu

Abstract: Freud, 'Civilization and its Discontents', XXI, pp. 115,116. Freud was highly crit-
ical of Woodrow Wilson, whom he considered a naive leader who misread the mutual
hostility inherent in social life. On this point, see Brunner, Freud: The Politics of Psycho-
analysis, ch. 4. It is important to note that when fascism emerged in Europe, Freud's sug-
gestion that the leader is essential to the formation of groups was strongly criticized.
Erich Fromm, for example, saw in his age a disintegration of the super-ego or conscience
(p. 167), and suggested that it is precisely the lack of individuality that springs from this
disintegration that propels men and women to crave an all-powerful leader and external
source of authority (or the anonymous rein of public opinion, the norm and science in
democratic regimes). Fascism, according to this interpretation, springs from the inability
of modern men and women to cope with their freedom and individuality, and with their
corresponding aloneness (or homelessness) in the world. See Erich Fromm, Escape
From Freedom (New York, 1941), especially chs. 5 and 7.<br>

Abstract: Using an "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, this essay analyzes the speech made by Mussolini in the square in Carbonia, Sardinia, on 18 December 1938. The analysis also takes in other speeches and reveals the power of Mussolini's logos: this was not simply inaugural, ritual and foundational in its celebration of the new town, but recognised a historic turning point in the policies of the Italian nation and empire in the passage of the fascist state from ruralism to industrial urbanism. By broadening the study, the power of Mussolini's declarative strategy becomes more apparent. Also that other subjects were submerged with subversive micro-narrations of different types. Finally, multiple discourses, practices and complex negotiating subjects appeared in the post-fascist democracy. The "anthropo-pragmatic" approach, which is at first restricted, is later broadened and utilized on a speech-by-speech basis: from the comical and satirical to the poetic and the contractual. Highlighting the discursive conflicts at work, examples are emphasized of dialectical speeches that constitute and characterize other antagonists and protagonists of democratic cultural modernity: the nurse-comedy-writer, miner-poet, and miner-trade unionist. In the new fascism these figures test new risky declarations that were also practices of freedom, caring for oneself and many others, to the extent of spreading into democratic relations. These speeches and themes operate in a setting where discursive and identity-related powers meet, hidden and manifest, public and private, in the mine and the city.<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Abstract: Rudolf Rocker, "Anarchism and Anarcho-syndicalism", re-
producido en P. Eitzbacher, ed., Anarchism, Freedom Press, Lon-
dres. En su libro Nationalism and Culturs, Londres, Freedom
Press, 1937, Rocker describe a Humboldt como "el representante
más prominente en Alemania" de la doctrina de los derechos
naturales y de la oposición al estado autoritario. Considera a
Rousseau como precursor de la doctrina autoritaria, pero en lo
que se refiere sólo al Contrato social, no al Discurso sobre la
desigualdad, obra mayormente literaria. Burrow hace la obser-
vación de que el ensayo de Humboldt se anticipa "a gran parte
de la teoría política decimonónica de tipo populista, anarquista
y sindicalista" y observa las anticipaciones del joven Marx. Para
comentarios más amplios, véase también mi Cartesian Linguistics.<br>

Abstract: Quels rapports peuvent se nouer entre travail et liberté, dès lors que le travail n'est plus essentiellement vécu comme la marque sociale de l'aliénation de la liberté dans l'économie? C'est Marx qui élabore pour la première fois et avec beaucoup de rigueur cette question, en formulant la théorie des deux règnes, celui de la nécessité et celui de la liberté dans le cadre de l'utopie communiste. Pour autant, sa position du problème n'est pas sans maintenir toute une série d'ambiguïtés. En nous appuyant sur les analyses contrastées de Simone Weil et d'André Gorz, nous montrons la dépendance de toute pensée de l'émancipation vis-à-vis d'une philosophie de la liberté qui assume (Gorz) ou qui n'assume pas (Weil) une certaine épaisseur irréductible de tout collectif humain, c'est-à-dire une indépassable hétéronomie de la condition humaine. What sort of connections can be formed between work and freedom, since the work is not essentially lived any more as the social mark of the alienation of the freedom in the economy? It is Marx who elaborates for the first time this problem by formulating the theory of both reigns, the reign of the necessity and the reign of the freedom, within the framework of the communist utopia. For all that, his position of the problem is not without maintaining a whole series of ambiguities. By pressing us on the analyses of Simone Weil and André Gorz, we show the dependence of any thought of emancipation towards a philosophy of the freedom which assumes (Gorz) or which does not assume (Weil) a certain inflexible thickness of any human collective.<br>

Date: 6 1, 1963<br>
Author(s): Wright Dominique<br>
Abstract: Cet article tente de clarifier les concepts de liberté et de contrainte à partir d'une étude de la conception architecturale, activité que les praticiens disent être un espace contraignant tout en parvenant à concevoir des solutions inédites. L'étude vise des résultats factuels et théoriques. Factuels, car il apparaît que les difficultés de l'exercice professionnel ne résultent pas tant des contraintes que de la sur-responsabilisation et de la sous-faisabilité des études qu'elles induisent. Théoriques, car les faits plaident pour une révision fondamentale du rapport négatif par lequel se définissent habituellement la liberté et la contrainte. Ces faits sont par exemple que les interdictions sont moins contraignantes que les prescriptions et que certaines stratégies de " phagocytage " peuvent trouver la voie de la liberté dans le respect à la lettre d'une contrainte. /// This article attempts to clarify the concepts of freedom and constraint through a study of architectural design work, an activity that its practitioners represent as a constraining space, though they in fact manage to find new solutions within it. The study aims at both factual and theoretical results: factual in that the difficulties of exercising this profession seem to be due less to constraints than the excessive degree of responsibility and near impracticability of the studies they induce; theoretical because certain facts suggest that a fundamental revision of the negative relation generally understood to obtain between freedom and constraint is in order. Two examples of such facts: prohibitions are not as constraining as prescriptions, and certain " absorption " strategies can open a path to freedom while following a given constraint " to the letter ". /// Dieser Artikel versucht die Begriffe von Freiheit und Zwang klarzustellen anhand einer Untersuchung von Architekturkonzepten, die die Praktiker als Aktivität in Zwangsräumen beurteilen, in denen trotzdem neue Lösungen möglich sind.

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014463<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

Abstract: O artigo pretende mostrar os termos na base dos quais se desenvolve na primeira produção piciana (Sonetos - Oratio e, em parte, o Heptaplus) uma forte concepção da autoconsciência humana, e de que modo esta a partir da certeza do próprio limite se torna positivamente consciência do criado. O desenvolvimento necessário de uma tal posição será o forte acento colocado por Giovanni Pico sobre a dignidade ontológica e criatural do ser humano: esta será elaborada primeiro nos termos de uma verdadeira filosofia da liberdade, mostrando-se depois até que ponto a autoconsciência e a própria dignidade humana levam o Conde da Concórdia a esboçar uma verdadeira e autêntica filosofia da responsabilidade, cuja primeira concretização mais forte se encontra no convite a recuperar a a dignidade originária do ser humano com vista à construção da paz. /// The article aims at showing the extent to which in his first writings (Sonetti -Oratio and incidentally Heptaplus,) Giovanni Pico della Mirandola develops a strong conception of human selfconsciousness, which at the same time represents an awareness of the human limits and of the created world. The necessary development of such a conception consists in Pico's underlining of the high, ontologic, dignity of the human being. The article shows how this takes the shape of a philosophy of freedom and, then, on the background of human selfconsciuosness and dignity, how the Count of Concordia outlines something like a philosophy of responsibility realizing itself in a strong invitation for people to rediscover the originary dignity of the human being in order to build peace.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Several representatives of structuralism relate the concept of structure to the langue of Ferdinand de Saussure. And so a linguistic approximation to structuralism seems possible. Such an approximation makes sense for another reason : because of the growing importance of transformational linguistics and the criticism of structuralism expressed by Noam Chomsky. In this article the main ideas of de Saussure and Chomsky are analysed, resulting in the confrontation of langue (de Saussure) and competence (Chomsky). Chomsky's criticism of langue as "a store of concepts" seems to be correct. The relevance of this criticism for the central structuralist topic that individual man, his freedom and his history are of minor importance, is pointed out.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: El interés por la búsqueda de soluciones a los déficits de legitimación del proyecto europeo ha provocado en las ciencias sociales y en la historia un enorme interés por el estudio de la idea de espacio público. Éste ha sido resultado del vínculo establecido por sectores intelectuales cercanos al europeísmo entre el desarrollo de un espacio público europeo con la reducción de la distancia existente entre las políticas públicas, las instituciones y la ciudadanía europea. Desde la perspectiva del historiador, sin embargo, el estudio del espacio público europeo no puede tener como único objetivo apoyar la creación de una identidad colectiva supranacional a partir de la construcción de un «relato europeo», destinado a restituir la ficción de una comunidad histórica de pertenencia, ni tampoco arrogarse la misión de fijar histórica y culturalmente las fronteras de Europa. La utilidad social de su estudio reside en la misma ambición de contribuir a la creación de ese espacio público europeo a partir de la promoción de valores que se asocian con Europa, como la libertad, la tolerancia y la democracia, sin renunciar por ello ni al imprescindible ejercicio de crítica ni al análisis riguroso de nuestro pasado inmediato. The interest in the search for solutions to the lacks of standing in the European project has caused a huge interest in the study of the idea of public sphere in all the Social Sciences disciplines, also in the History. An interest that is a result of to have been linked the development of a European public sphere with a reduction in the distance between public policy, institutions and European citizenship in intellectual groups close to Europeanism. However, from the historian s perspective, the study of the European public sphere can not have the sole aim to support the creation of a supranational collective identity from the construction of a «European story» designed to restore the fiction about a historic community of membership, as well as not to assume t~<br>

Publisher: Tsehai Publishers<br>
Issue: i40081926<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a critical reappraisal of Abba Bahrey's Zenahu leGalla, the controversial 16th century text. Some scholars criticize it as harbouring anti-Oromo sentiments while others praise it as an important source on the organization of Oromo society The paper argues that, while Zenahu leGalla does provide useful historical information on the Oromo, its lasting value lies elsewhere: in the critical reflection it initiates on the issues of power, freedom, social change, violence, and the public use of reason. To unpack these issues, occluded by current interpretations of Zenahu leGalla, the paper undertakes a critical hermeneutical reading of the text. The reading shows that Bahrey's text incubates emancipatory surplus meanings that transcend his epoch and speak to the concerns of contemporary Ethiopia. In the concluding sections, the paper discusses the issues of democracy and development in light of these surplus meanings.<br>

Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40084883<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Cochrane James R.<br>
Abstract: The essay refers to a concern for social justice in the origins of public health, borne in part by religious commitments, and to more recent expressions of a similar concern in debates about health equity. Equity, moreover, is affected by discursive power relations (dominant/hegemonic versus local/suppressed), which are discussed in relation to current research in the African Religious Health Assets Programme on the interaction of particular 'healthworlds' (a conceptual innovation) that shape the choices and behaviour of health-seekers. Two background theoretical positions guide the argument: Amartya Sen's claim that development is linked to freedom (including religious freedom); and, building on Sen's and Martha Nussbaum's human capabilities theory, an asset-based community approach to the building or reconstruction of public health systems. On this basis, it is argued that health systems and health interventions are just to the extent that they mediate between the necessary leadership or polity from 'above' (techné) and the experience and wisdom (métis) of those who are 'below', taking into account the asymmetries of power that this equation represents. Because difference and diversity are so often expressed in what we might reasonably call 'religious' terms, I specifically emphasize the continuing persistence of religion and, hence, the importance of accounting for its pertinence in social theory generally, and in relation to discourses of health and justice in the African context specifically. Acknowledging the ambiguities of religion, I nevertheless argue that an appreciative alignment between public health systems and religious or faith-based initiatives in health promotion, prevention and care is crucial to sustainable and just health systems in Africa.<br>

Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Author(s): Jones Ricky L.<br>
Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i40101498<br>

Author(s): Perrin Christophe<br>
Abstract: S'il déclame contre les deux principes qui sont ceux de Descartes, Sartre se réclame pourtant de lui. Sans doute n'est-il pas à un paradoxe près. Reste qu'il nous faudra ne pas l'être moins pour expliquer le sien. Car certes, le sens du texte qu'il intitule « La liberté cartésienne » et qui articule ce volume de morceaux choisis qu'est Descartes 1596-1650 confère quelque cohérence à cet apparent non-sens. Mais une fois présenté de cette oeuvre le paratexte, il nous faudra affirmer non seulement que celle-ci se lit avant L'être et le néant quoiqu'elle ait été publiée après, mais, plus encore, qu'elle est un ensemble d'écrits de Descartes sur Sartre quoiqu'elle soit un écrit de Sartre sur Descartes. C'est qu'outre l'analyse sartrienne des analyses cartésiennes de la Méditation quatrième, on y trouve une psychanalyse existentielle par l'auteur de son devancier, à l'occasion de laquelle a lieu non pas un transfert, mais un contre-transfert. Although Sartre denounces Descartes' two principles, he nevertheless draws inspiration from him. No doubt this is close to being paradoxical; we shall have to be no less paradoxical in our explanation. For although the text entitled "Cartesian Freedom," which introduces a volume of selections from Descartes, Descartes 1596Ί650, confers some coherence on this apparent non-sense, once the texts surrounding this work have been taken into account, we have to conclude not only that this text predates Beinjj and Nothingness, even though it was published afterwards, but that it is a collection of Descartes' writings on Sartre, even though it is a writing by Sartre on Descartes. For beyond the Sartrean analysis of the Cartesian analyses of the Fourth Meditation, we find Sartre's existential psychoanalysis of his predecessor, in which takes place not a transference, but a counter-transference.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the idea of Europe elaborated by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers. During the Twenties and the Thirties Jaspers criticized the supremacy of modern technology on society. After the Second World War he was interested in studying the development of European civilization and the foundation of a world order based on peace, freedom, democracy and mutual respect. With the partition of the world between Us and Russia, during the Cold War Jaspers proposed to build a confederation of the West against Russian totalitarianism. Making a first step toward an universal order, Europe had the important role of giving the fundamental values to it. L'article analyse l'idée d'Europe élaborée par le philosophe allemand Karl Jaspers. Au centre des réflexions politiques de Jaspers dans les années Vingt et Trente il y avait la crise de l'Europe et la critique de l'ère de la technique. À partir de l'après-guerre la pensée politique du philosophe s'était tournée vers l'étude de la civilisation européenne et la recherche d'un ordre mondial basé sur la paix, la liberté, la démocratie et le respect mutuel. Après le partage du monde entre l'Amérique et la Russie lors de la guerre froide Jaspers a proposé la confédération de l'Occident libre contre la menace totalitaire russe comme premier pas vers un ordre universel. Dans un tel processus l'Europe avait un rôle décisif: caractérisée par la rationalité et la liberté dialectique, la civilisation européenne était porteuse de valeurs fondamentales pour un futur ordre mondial.<br>

Abstract: Recent events indicate that self-interest and technicism today triumph over social consciousness; yet educators naturally turn to the humanities as an antidote to positivism and technical domination, even as humanities scholars are increasingly defensive, struggling to hold on to their enclaves. For those committed to the practice of freedom in education the humanities are of vital interest, particularly when they are defined as works that are articulations of some human consciousness thrusting into the world. After giving examples of works that may be classified as "humanities" according to this definition, the following essay discusses teaching situations and literary works which might free persons for awareness of human possibility, for authentic talk and widening perspectives. The humanities must be presented not as monuments to be revered but as works to be shared by students and applied to their own life situations. Students grounded in their "everydayness" can be awakened by Freiré's dialogical method, awakened to crítical consciousness and to the possibility of praxis in a world they share.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit de montrer comment l'ouvrage de J. Sommet, L'honneur de la liberté, réflexion biographique, avec, pour point fort, l'expérience du camp de Dachau, enracine, dans son récit, une pensée de la liberté, apte à trancher l'indéfini des débats d'école, tant dans le rapport entre liberté et loi que dans la relation avec des groupes différents dans leurs options sur le sens de la vie. In this narrative is shown how, through several experiences (including at Dachau concentration camp) freedom is at work and transcends intellectual discussions in matters concerning the relation between freedom and law and also different conceptions about the meaning of life.<br>

Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Giuseppe Capograssi (1889-1956) was an important legal philosopher and had a lively influence on the development of legal studies. The centre of his reflections lay in his many investigations into the concept of experience, which aimed to supersede the prevalent orientation in Italy, focussed on vertexes, emphasizing instead the importance of practices, both on the theoretical level and in the analysis of legal activity and political reality. Capograssi therefore paid great attention to the relationship between state and society viewed in a dynamic and pluralist perspective. No less illuminating are Capograssi's investigations into the value of the constitution and the principle of legality. During the Fascist period, Capograssi upheld the values of individual liberty and democratic principles, seeing as indispensable the continual involvement of citizens in the development of political action. This perspective played a further, particularly important role in the "ideas of Capograssi", after the war and the advent of the republican legal order. According to Capograssi, more space needed to be given to social life and to the spiritual links on which political community is based. In this sense, Capograssi found the teachings of Catholicism fundamental. His Catholicism placed great emphasis on freedom and solidarity and contained a lively, underlying sense of the cultural and spiritual, inspired by the ideal of "charity".<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: La notion de tolérance est problématique: je m'efforce de le montrer en considérant tout d'abord les critiques dont elle est ou a été la cible. Puis, en partant de la conception de Locke, je relève les dilemmes qui peuvent surgir de la mise en pratique de la tolérance et la nécessité, mais aussi la difficulté, de fixer les limites de son application. Corollaire de la liberté de pensée et de l'acceptation du pluralisme, la tolérance est décrite, en dernier lieu, comme mise à l'épreuve purificatrice de nos convictions et comme instauratrice d'une véritable relation de réciprocité dans la mesure où elle parvient à dépasser le simple acquiescement à la diversité. The concept of tolerance is problematic : this I try to show first by considering the criticisms made of it. Then, starting with the perception of Locke, I point out the potential dilemmas of practising tolerance and the need, as well as the difficulty, of fixing limits to tolerance. A corollary to the freedom of thought and the approbation of pluralism, tolerance is finally described as the refining proof of conviction and the instigator of true reciprocity to the degree that it goes beyond the simple acquiescence of diversity.<br>

Abstract: Dans le contexte des recherches actuelles sur le corps, cet article souligne la fécondité du dialogue engagé par P. Ricœur entre les savoirs objectifs et la phénoménologie dans la description des rapports de la nature et de la liberté. Cette conversation dessine une mise en relation originale entre l'existence corporelle et la Transcendance; elle invite à reconnaître dans la corporéité le lieu d'incarnation d'une confiance primordiale. In the context of current research on the body, this articles underlines the rich dialogue begun by P. Ricœur between the objective sciences and phenomenology on the connection between nature and freedom. This dialogue establishes an original link between corporal existence and transcendence; it invites us to see corporality as the incarnation of a primordial trust.<br>

Abstract: Les Lumières européennes provoquent un double déplacement des coordonnées socio-culturelles dans lesquelles s'inscrit le christianisme : la critique rationnelle de la religion et la privatisation du croire induisent un processus de sécularisation auquel le christianisme doit réagir. Pour ce faire, le protestantisme développe une théorie du christianisme dont Kant, Schleiermacher et Hegel formulent les paradigmes. C'est au gré d'une reprise sélective de ces trois penseurs qu' au cours du XIXe et du XXe siècle le protestantisme allemand se positionnera au sein du monde moderne, s'efforçant d'identifier les sphères socio-culturelles lui permettant de faire valoir le thème où se jouent tant sa vérité théologique que sa pertinence socio-culturelle : la liberté. Ce cadre théorique permet d'expliciter ce qu'il en est de concepts souvent galvaudés : théologie libérale, Kulturprotestantismus, néo-protestantisme. The European enlightenment provoked a double displacement of the social and cultural components of Christianity : rationalist criticism of religion and the privatisation of belief led to a process of secularization to which Christianity had to react. To do so, Protestantism developed a theory of Christianity based on paradigms formulated by Kant, Schleiermacher and Hegel. It was through a selective return to these three thinkers that in the 19th and 20th centuries, German Protestantism took a position in the modern world, trying to identify those social and cultural spheres which would foster a theme essential to both its theological truth and its social-cultural pertinence : the theme of freedom. This theoretical framework allowed it to explain often tarnished concepts such as liberal theology, Kulturprotestantismus, neo-protestantism.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se donne pour but de montrer en quoi les philosophies existentialistes rappellent à la foi chrétienne les questions décisives auxquelles elle doit sans cesse se confronter. Il le fait en partant de thèmes concrets traités par les existentialistes de manière à interpeller la foi de manière radicale: les enjeux de la liberté, l'incarnation de l'être humain dans un corps et une histoire, et les difficultés de la communication avec autrui. Par là même l'existentialisme est à même de «nettoyerc» la foi chrétienne. The writer shows existentialist philosophies reminding the Christian faith of decisive questions it must continually ask itself. On the basis of such concrete themes treated by existentialists, he questions the faith in a radical way concerning the stakes of freedom, the incarnation of humankind in a body and in history, and the difficulties of interpersonal communication. Existentialism is thus in a position to «cleanse» the Christian faith.<br>

Abstract: Alors qu'il défend une extension du libéralisme politique au champ de la morale, Ruwen Ogien plaide pour la liberté. Mais l'assimilation de la liberté au consentement appauvrit le sens de la liberté, tout comme la supposée transparence du sujet à lui-même. En ce sens, le libéralisme politique comme structure formelle tourne à vide, s'il ne peut compter sur une mise en débat de perspectives plus substantielles de la liberté, des visions du monde, des éthiques et des convictions. In defending an extention of political liberalism to the field of morals, Ruwen Ogien makes a plea for freedom. But the assimilation of liberty to consent impoverishes the meaning of liberty, as does the supposed transparence of the subject to oneself. In this way, political liberalism as a formal structure runs in neutral, if it cannot depend on a debate concerning more substantial perspectives of liberty, of world visions, of ethics and convictions.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Article Title: "Say First What Cause": Ricoeur and the Etiology of Evil in Paradise Lost<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219783<br>
Date: 1 1, 1979<br>
Author(s): Webber John S.<br>
Abstract: Paradise Lost traces evil through three inceptions-Satanic, Adamic, and historical. Each origin seems to envision a different etiology: Satanic evil springs exclusively from the self in an instant of radical "Pelagian" freedom. Adamic evil emerges from the ambiguous interplay between self and seductive environment. Historical evil contaminates the whole race by means of necessary "Augustinian" inheritance. Ricoeur's analysis of the "Adamic Myth" and original sin clarifies etiological traditions Milton assimilates from Christian symbol, myth, and dogma. Through Ricoeur, we can identify the contrasting modalities of evil (inherited and imitative, physical and moral, ontological and existential, necessary and free, communal and individual) fused in Paradise Lost. Ricoeur's work reveals Milton's text to be a subtly inclusive etiological myth, one whose complex genesis of evil recovers Scripture's fullness of meaning in a new mythopoesis.<br>

Author(s): Williams Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219832<br>
Date: 5 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yellin Peter A.<br>
Abstract: In his Narrative (1845), Frederick Douglass constructs a self based on conversion rhetoric and binary logic. In the greatly expanded My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), he complicates this textual self by both imitating and criticizing tropes conventionally used in the slavery debate, such as metaphors related to animals. Christianity, and manhood. Emphasizing the constructed nature of mimesis and metaphor, Douglass demonstrates his ability to escape the bondage of reductionist language even as he claims the power associated with linguistic mastery. This revision of self emerges from his experience of northern racism, manifested in his limited role in William Lloyd Garrison's organization. Douglass's renunciation of Garrisonian dogma and his entry into political action-including his striking textual reinterpretation of the United States Constitution-coincide with the stylistically "modernist" self of the second autobiography.<br>

Abstract: Liberia was born of the efforts of the American Colonization Society, founded in 1816, to resettle freed black slaves. The resettlement took place on a strip of coastal land in Mesurado. The colony was initially called Christopolis but was later rechristened Monrovia, after the American president James Monroe (Wilson, 25–30). The colony expanded to what would later be known as Liberia, a place of freedom. For John-Peter Pham, social divisions “have characterized the complex tapestry of Liberian society from the very beginning” (52). Yekutiel Gershoni states that Liberia's ruling elites, comprising exclusively the descendants of free slaves, “chose to adopt attitudes and tactics … which were borrowed from the colonial administrators of white powers” toward the “indigenous Africans” (xi). The Americo-Liberians, as they were called, were largely “perceived by the Africans as foreign rulers in every sense” (95). George Klay Kieh Jr. rightly argues that while the ethno-cultural antagonisms between and among the various ethnic groups were not what led to the eventual political and social collapse of the country, they surely did not create political cohesion (25–29).<br>

Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Abstract: Fifteen hundred years later, Hegel called his philosophy of history a theodicy. History is a slaughter bench, he said, in which the good seemed to suffer, the evil to triumph. Could we find reason or even meaning in this sorry panorama? But reason is cunning, he claimed, and is working to produce good out of evil, freedom out of oppression. The city of God is not beyond the world but is emerging in history itself. In fact, it is really at hand, and philosophy can show us this.<br>

Abstract: Questions like this have shaped much of my own work. Being surrounded by so many enthusiastic but incompatibly articulate spokespersons for neglected lifeworld concerns, I concluded that criticism of tradition is most powerful when offered by those who are already in the midst of trying to be better phenomenologists—not, of course, in the sense that they are trying to be better members of a philosophical school but in the sense that they are motivated by the urge to find better ways to articulate something that tradition distorts or neglects. Why
      shouldaccounts of what matters most in life first be measured against the standards of “clear and distinct” propositional speech? Does anyone reallylive though life, thinking of it as a process going on inside our bodies? Do we reallyexperiencefreedom as an unconceptualizable combination of limitlessness and limit? And why throw the metaphorical wet blanket of a rigorously trained consciousness and its “correlates” over thepretheoretical practices of everyday life? Negative genuflections to philosophy's traditional priorities, privileging the subjective instead of the objective, inner instead of outer, lived body instead of house-for-the-mind—all of these inversions ultimately foster the continuing and undeserved hegemony of a traditionally objectivist understanding of what is Really Real. Kockelmans once told me that Merleau-Ponty eventually decidedPhenomenology of Perception“was not yet a philosophical book.” To be sure, its content and much of its treatment of that content is phenomenological, but its structure is still Cartesian. To start with specificallybodilyperception, however generously reconceived, still implies that other dimensions of presence to the world—linguistic, social, cultural, political, historical—can be added on at a later time, perhaps along with discussions of abstractly identified and timeless “topics” like freedom, the self, and so on.<br>

Abstract: It is perhaps no coincidence, then, that the word
      responsibilityfirst appears in these juridical writings at the very same time that Kant produces his most powerful articulations of the metaphysics of morals in which he reconciles morals and politics through a kind of strict moral bookkeeping based on the principle of equality contained in the notion oflex talionis, or justice as retribution. Although lex talionis also takes us back to the Judeo-Christian doctrine of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth found in the Old Testament, and ultimately Kant, too, grounds its absolute authority on the benevolence of a rational God, Kant is clear that the retaliation required by the law of talionis cannot be based on revenge but, rather, must be based on equality. The word that Kant uses for equality isGleichheit, which also connotes likeness. To be fair, the punishment must fit the crime in the sense of like for like. In both his moral theory and his political theory, Kant insists on the connection between freedom and equality. Moreover, as we know, he maintains that morality requires that we do our duty for its own sake and not from inclinations or emotions alone. To spite the fact that Kant explicitly opposes to the mechanisms of nature the freedom that he claims warrants human dignity, Nietzsche criticizes Kant's “economic justification of virtue,” which makes morality a matter of mechanically following laws (Nietzsche2003, 176; cf., e.g., Kant1795, 340–41).<br>

Abstract: In the SPEP volume published in 1983 and made up of selected papers from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth meetings, the editors, William McBride and Calvin Schrag, commented on the “radicality, openness, passion for dialogue, freedom, and interest in pluralism” that the included papers made apparent. The year 1984 marked a significant turning point especially for the organization. The Committee on the Status of Women formed with the purpose of increasing the participation of women in SPEP. In 1981 six women participated in the program, three of them as moderators. In 1982 four women participated, one as moderator, and Joan Stambaugh gave an invited paper at the Nietzsche Society. In 1983 nine women participated, and two others gave papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. In 1984, five women participated, with one moderator among them, and there were three women giving papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. Then, after the founding of the Committee on the Status of Women in 1984, the program in 1985 had sixteen women on the program inclusive of two moderators, a keynote address by Julia Kristeva, and a book session on Ofelia Shutte's book
         Beyond Nihilism. One woman gave a paper at the Nietzsche Society. In that year Arleen Dallery became the first woman elected to SPEP's Executive Committee. The voting members at the twenty-fifth SPEP conference in 1986 selected Professor Dallery as the first woman co-director of SPEP, and twenty-four women were on the program, with four moderators. A panel discussed Linda Nicholson's bookGender and History, and Joan Stambaugh gave the paper “The Future of Continental Philosophy” in a plenary session symposium. Also in that year, at a tumultuous business session, the membership agreed that the Executive Committee would provide annually statistics on the number of papers by women that were submitted and that were accepted.

Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: To sketch how prefiguration works in public memory, I return briefly to the example of contemporary juvenile biographies. Such texts are shaped by enduring commonplaces of U.S. public culture that “prefigure” the narratives in the texts and thus render them intelligible on a basic level to members of that broader culture. Individual life stories become recognizable historical narratives because they resonate with late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century American perceptions of historical action. The introduction to the popular Americans All series of biographies provides an example. This widely circulated series published in the 1960s and 1970s features dozens of juvenile biographies. These books focus on individuals that have “uniquely contributed to the American way of life,” including figures such as Henry Ford, Martin Luther King Jr., and Sojourner Truth. Elaborating on these generic contributions, a short introduction to each text explains that “often despite great odds, these famous people have attained success in their fields through the good use of ability, determination, and hard work” (Patterson 1970, inside cover). Readers of this series learn not only about individual people; they learn about the public culture in which these lives were lived and in which these stories were constructed. As Ricoeur explains, “To understand a story is to understand both the language of ‘doing something’ and the cultural tradition from which proceeds the typology of plots” (1984, 1:57). The “language of ‘doing something’” that shapes children's biographies often stems from cultural assumptions about what it means to be historically significant. Did the subject have a lasting impact on society? Was she or he associated with other prominent figures? In American public culture, other values affect the way in which individual lives will be narrated: liberal individualism; the myth of progress and its individualized variant, “personal growth”; and the ideal of freedom, amo~<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: In some ways, a rejection of utopia would be a rejection of the humanist tradition of rhetoric, which is not propaganda but an art emphasizing reason, personal freedom in the audience, and the development of goodwill: in essence, the practical use of ideals and idealism rather than a pure materialism. In the liberal-humanist tradition, rhetoric and politics have worked toward ideals extracted from the people of the time. This idealism adds an inherently ethical stance in the arts of persuasion and statecraft. Here we are moving out of a limited view of utopia in terms of content and genre and toward a much broader, yet still liberal humanist view of the utopian impulse as a function of the human condition. Utopian studies has tended to rely on sociologists and political scientists for groundwork in this branch of their field, and most of these theorists are Marxist-influenced, although some seem to evolve from liberal humanism in their embracing of aesthetic ideals.<br>

Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>
