  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Almost thirty years ago, in an essay devoted to the
                  Autobiography of Malcolm X, Thomas Benson commented that rhetoric is, among other things, a way of constituting the self within a scene composed of “exigencies, constraints, others and the self,” and it is also a resource for “exercising control over self, others, and by extension the scene.”¹ Thus, Benson assigns rhetoric a dual function. It is simultaneously generative and instrumental, since it helps to constitute the identity of self, other, and scene, while it also pulls these identities within the orbit of situated interests. Moreover, once this duality is acknowledged,<br>

  Author(s) Alison James<br>
  Abstract: If the devil is in the details, then God is in the prepositions, and I want today to look at one such preposition: the little word “for.” I think this to be the most diffi cult and delicate word to parse in the whole of theology. Let me explain why. As St. Th omas Aquinas taught us, we cannot say of God what God is, only what God is not. Th is very properly negative approach to God is vital if we are to avoid idolatry.

  Abstract: The father is dead. On this point, Julia Kristeva and René Girard agree. What then can be said any longer of the paternal function? What legacy of the father persists in ongoing economies of sacrifice? And, if the father is not actually dead but only missing in action within the family romance, site of our earliest mimetic rivalries, what role, if any, could a father play in an intimate domain characterized by positive, nonconflictual mimesis? May a father yet live within intimate spaces? Endeavoring to answer these questions, I turn to literature, for Girard and Kristeva agree that literature is<br>

  Abstract: The categories “western peoples” and “inferior races” to which the above quotation refers have undergone several transformations over the past century. Just as these categories were once accepted as natural, the contemporary categories of “first world/third world,” “core/periphery,” “developed/underdeveloped,” “modern/traditional,” and “North/South” are widely regarded in international relations as neutral and unproblematic. They function as a pre-conceptual frame within which relations among countries so classified can be analyzed. This is true of a variety of approaches that differ radically in other ways, yet share these same classificatory schemes. The approach taken in this study suggests that relations among countries classified<br>

  Book Title: For René Girard-Essays in Friendship and in Truth<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams James G.<br>
  Abstract: In his explorations of the relations between the sacred and violence, René Girard has hit upon the origin of culture-the way culture began, the way it continues to organize itself. The way communities of human beings structure themselves in a manner that is different from that of other species on the planet.Like Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Émile Durkheim, Martin Buber, or others who have changed the way we think in the humanities or in the human sciences, Girard has put forth a set of ideas that have altered our perceptions of the world in which we function. We will never be able to think the same way again about mimetic desire, about the scapegoat mechanism, and about the role of Jewish and Christian scripture in explaining sacrifice, violence, and the crises from which our culture has been born.The contributions fall into roughly four areas of interpretive work: religion and religious study; literary study; the philosophy of social science; and psychological studies.The essays presented here are offered as "essays" in the older French sense of attempts (essayer) or trials of ideas, as indeed Girard has tried out ideas with us. With a conscious echo of Montaigne, then, this hommage volume is titled

For Stoker standard time served a double function: it preserved England’s ontological purity by excising the temporally untranslatable, and it provided a model for a total narrative, able to assimilate various classes, nations, and dialects (spoken by the multinational vampire hunters) as well as various media.

  Abstract: Memory’s fallibility is well documented; its powers, less so. Acknowledging the evidential traces that all significant events leave behind, the preceding essays in this volume make memory’s credibility more evident. How ironic it is that so much ink has been spilled on social memory’s incidental functions—the forgetting or ignoring of wrongdoing, legitimating and challenging power, exaggerating and underestimating beneficent acts, giving voice to the marginalized—while its major function, to bring us into more direct contact with the past, the very capacity that gives memory its survival value, has led to nothing significant in the way of theoretical explication.<br>

  Abstract: In “Education and Prayer,” Emmanuel Levinas complains that our prayer has too often become a purely isolated and individuated experience and that we have lost the social and collective dimension of prayer.¹ Prayer, he suggests, always has a liturgical and communal function. Prayer requires openness and truth and hence has ethical significance and import. Jean-Luc Marion is profoundly influenced by Levinas’s philosophy. His own account of prayer bears traces of Levinas’s thought and orients itself along Levinasian suggestions regarding relation to the other. Yet Marion’s account of prayer lacks precisely the communal, social, and ethical dimension for which Levinas calls.<br>

  Book Title: Gazing Through a Prism Darkly: Reflections on Merold Westphal's Hermeneutical Epistemology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): PUTT B. KEITH<br>
  Abstract: Merold Westphal has been in the foremost ranks of philosophers who proclaim a new postsecular philosophy. By articulating an epistemology sensitive to the realities of cognitive finitude and moral weakness, he defends a wisdom that begins in both humility and commitment, one that always confesses that human beings can encounter meaning and truth only as human beings, never as gods.The present volume focuses on this wisdom of humility that characterizes Westphal's thought and explores how that wisdom, expressed through the redemptive dynamic of doubt, can contribute to developing a postsecular apologetic for faith.This book can function both as an accessible introduction to Westphal for those who have not read him extensively and also as an informed critical appreciation and extension of his work for those who are more experienced readers.<br>

Performativity in the sense of the way a dance, a musical composition, or a part in a play is performed has practically nothing to do with performativity in the sense of the ability a given enunciation has to function as a performative speech act. “He gave a spectacular performance of Hamlet” does not exemplify, nor does it refer to, the same use of language as does saying “He gave his solemn promise that he would be here at ten,” even though both are forms of enunciation, of speaking out,<br>

  Abstract: The seductive enigma of the word
                  passion—and the Christian passion to which it is tied—seems to me to lie in the way in which it allows the subject at its center to function as subject and object both at once.

  Abstract: Philosophical hermeneutics is built on the assumption that people make sense of their lives by placing themselves in a larger normative context.
                  Environmentalhermeneutics focuses on the fact that environments matter to people, too, because environments embody just such contexts.¹ This is most obvious for cultural landscapes, yet it applies to the specifically natural world as well: Nature can function as a larger normative context with its own narrative dimension. However, there are many different placial and temporal dimensions at play in our relation to the landscape, which can give rise to different normative interpretations of the meaning of a<br>

  Abstract: The seeds of the aesthetic are buried deep in the work of Charles Sanders Peirce. The sprouts were, therefore, rather slow to show themselves. However, the concept of the imagination as framed by Kant and other German Enlightenment thinkers does emerge in the ground of his epistemology, ontology, and metaphysics. Peirce recognizes the important function of Kantian reproductive imagination as he develops a description of inquiry that underscores the continuity between bodily sensation and understanding, once again challenging the mind-body dualism to which the idealists and empiricists continually fell prey. A more radical claim emerges from this challenge, namely that<br>

  Abstract: I wish here to explore the relation between our desire to exist meaningfully through action and the question that this poses for philosophy. My thesis is simple: We are erotic beings. Our Eros, however, is neither divine nor animal. It is distinctively human: We are beings who seek meaning imaginatively through each other, and the locus of this transformative encounter is the community. This model of human nature contrasts with the dominant view in analytic philosophy of humans as “minds” consisting of “states,” as purely “epistemic subjects” whose primary function is thought to lie in generating propositional claims about the<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  Author(s) Kaufman J.B.<br>
  Abstract: The work of Jan Svankmajer, celebrated Czechoslovakian animator and avant-garde filmmaker, demonstrates an ongoing pre-occupation with the codes and conditions of bodily function and identity. His fictions are characterised by the recognition of transience in the body and the place of the body as a defining instrument in socio-cultural mechanisms and indeed, as a socio-cultural mechanism. Svankmajer uses the unique vocabulary of animation in expressing these principles and essentially re-defines the conditions by which the body might be represented and re-defined aesthetically and politically.<br>

  Abstract: Genre fiction is project-based art. Whether cowboy Western or intergalactic sci-fi, genre writing entails a double inventiveness according to the set of directives imposed upon each story in advance. On the one hand, by definition such writing exercises a creative function following explicit conditions of constraint, whether formal, aesthetic, historical, moral, or economic. From the pulps to the remainder bin, genre fiction necessarily knows its limits; this is part of its “project.” On the other<br>

  Abstract: Buildings serve many purposes. One might argue that their primary function is to provide shelter for the inhabitants and their possessions—a place to stay warm and dry, and to sleep without fear of predators or pathogens. Buildings also provide spaces to safely contain and facilitate social groups focused on learning, work, or play. And they provide for privacy, a space for solace and retreat from the social demands of human existence. These primary physical requirements, and their many subsidiaries, simply reflect the fact that we are biological creatures.

The Welsh countryside and its imagined characteristics hold a very privileged place in dominant constructions of national identity. Myths of a peaceable and tolerant nation, deeply embedded in the national imaginary are rooted in an idealized Welsh rural community life that summons the trope of the gwerin, a particular form of localized communitarianism to express the values of egalitarianism, classlessness and internationalism.

Mexican literary responses to the United States’ invasion of its territory, and to Mexico’s continued defeats on the battlefield, constitute an invaluable archive for examining the emergence of Mexican nationalism. Indeed, during the war and its aftermath, Mexican writers recognized the value of national unity as they never had before, because they saw their defeat on the battlefield as a function of their political disunity. “A nation is nothing but a large<br>

However, their historiographical function has been generally overlooked by transitional justice scholars, as well as historians.¹ It is understandable that temporary panels established primarily for human rights investigation, rather than the publication of professional historiography, fail to draw attention to their engagement with the past. In addition, not all truth commissions complement forensic investigation with a historical narrative.

Sybille Krämer illustrates this argument with a diverse range of situations involving some form of transmission, including the circulation of money, the translation of languages, the spread of infectious diseases, processes of transference and countertransference as seen in psychoanalysis, and even the development of cartography. This rich study provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of media philosophy while illuminating transmission media as active mediators in all systems of exchange.<br>

But it is also entirely new, and the fact that Thomas More coined a self-canceling name for the island and the political idea associated with it tends to function somewhat like King Utopus’s moat, cordoning off that idea from the continent from which it might have come, either directly or indirectly.

  Book Title: Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: A generally acknowledged characteristic of modern life, namely the temporalization of experience, inextricable from our intensified experience of contingency and difference, has until now remained largely outside psychology's purview. Wherever questions about the development, structure, and function of the concept of time have been posed - for example by Piaget and other founders of genetic structuralism - they have been concerned predominantly with concepts of "physical", chronometrical time, and related concepts (e.g., "velocity"). All the contributions to the present volume attempt to close this gap. A larger number are especially interested in the narration of stories. Overviews of the relevant literature, as well as empirical case studies, appear alongside theoretical and methodological reflections. Most contributions refer to specifically historical phenomena and meaning-constructions. Some touch on the subjects of biographical memory and biographical constructions of reality. Of all the various affinities between the contributions collected here, the most important is their consistent attention to issues of the constitution and representation of temporal experience.<br>

As neither wholly good, nor wholly evil, the shape of the powers must be discerned. Yoder’s theological method privileges a form of discernment rooted in the practical encounter between specific Christian communities and specific powers. Discernment is ultimately a function of mission. Theologians’ contribution to this mission is limited, according to Yoder, yet indispensable for the discernment process. The theologian’s gifts of linguistic analysis and scriptural and historical memory are useful because they facilitate a comparison of the powers with the way of Jesus.<br>

  Abstract: We have seen in our previous discussions that divine sight can involve aesthetic and moral appreciation, a transfer of authority, an acknowledgement of moral uprightness, and a judgment fitting the crime. In our next context, we find yet another function and meaning for divine sight—establishing worth. A disconcerting and yet pivotal chapter in the story of Abraham, Gen 16 has traditionally been assumed to recount a failed human attempt to build a legacy. Many clues, however, indicate that more is happening than meets the eye. Not only are the patriarch and matriarch of the people of God, the models<br>

  Abstract: The book of Lamentations was birthed in order to bring a deep and profound grief before the throne of Yhwh in the context of communal worship. It found ongoing relevance for the people of God in the worship of Jewish and Christian communities over the centuries and, if it is to function as

  Abstract: The anatomical model - a re-creation of normal or pathological anatomy created in various material - is usually regarded as simply a teaching aid for those studying to be physicians, and although the historical discourse surrounding anatomy often testifies to that purpose alone, a diversity in its function emerges if the researcher looks beyond the written text. The artistic choices made by creators of anatomical models reinforce messages about how a society views its own corporality, and by examining the way in which anatomy models are fabricated and decorated, cultural attitudes about the body in a given time period can<br>

  Book Title: Useful Fictions-Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): AUSTIN MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on evolutionary biology, anthropology, narrative theory, cognitive psychology, game theory, and evolutionary aesthetics, Austin develops the concept of a "useful fiction," a simple narrative that serves an adaptive function unrelated to its factual one. In his work we see how these useful fictions play a key role in neutralizing the overwhelming anxiety that humans can experience as their minds gather and process information. Rudimentary narratives constructed for this purpose, Austin suggests, provided a cognitive scaffold that might have become the basis for our well-documented love of fictional stories. Written in clear, jargon-free prose and employing abundant literary examples-from the Bible to
      One Thousand and One Arabian NightsandDon QuixotetoNo Exit-Austin's work offers a new way of understanding the relationship between fiction and evolutionary processes-and, perhaps, the very origins of literature.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings.

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

First, it is concerned with consumption without relating it to production, and second, the politics of consumption in the practice of political consumerism is not accompanied by a project of ethics.

  Book Title: Metaphor, Morality, and the Spirit in Romans 8-1–17<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Robinson William E. W.<br>
  Abstract: In this innovative book, William E. W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:1-17 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul's audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul's Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:1-17 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.<br>

  Book Title: Seamus Heaney as Aesthetic Thinker-A Study of the Prose<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): MacKillop James<br>
  Abstract: Seamus Heaney’s unexpected death in August 2013 brought to completion his body of work, and scholars are only now coming to understand the full scale and importance of this extraordinary career. The Nobel Prize–winning poet, translator, and playwright from the North of Ireland is considered the most important Irish poet after Yeats and, at the time of his death, arguably the most famous living poet. For this reason, much of the scholarship to date on Heaney has understandably focused on his poetry. O’Brien’s new work, however, focuses on Heaney’s essays, book chapters, and lectures as it seeks to understand how Heaney explored the poet’s role in the world. By examining Heaney’s prose, O’Brien teases out a clearer understanding of Heaney’s sense of the function of poetry as an act of public intellectual and ethical inquiry. In doing so, O’Brien reads Heaney as an aesthetic thinker in the European tradition, considering him alongside Heidegger, Derrida, Lacan, and Adorno. Studying Heaney within this theoretical and philosophical tradition sheds new and useful light on one of the greatest creative minds of the twentieth century.<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

  Abstract: One way of looking at Arthur Schopenhauer’s thought is to view it as a synthesis between Kant and Plato (together with Plotinus) on the one hand and the Indian tradition on the other. Schopenhauer’s early work
                  On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reasonwas straight Kantian analysis.¹ Recall in Kant the three levels of form, which function as filters or glasses through which the world of appearance is constituted. The first level is that of the forms of sensibility—space and time—which furnish the encompassing frame of all appearance; the second, the level of the categories<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 4 of
                  On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin briefly discusses why birds sing. It is often, he notes, a function of “the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females.”¹ A particularly strong or melodious song will contribute to reproductive success both by inducing females to mate and by announcing territoriality to other males. Darwin was unaware of modern genetics, but neo-Darwinians would say that a strikingly robust or appealing song makes it more likely that the male will be able to get his genes into the next generation and, over<br>

  Author(s) Boyd Gregory A.<br>
  Abstract: Because of my commitment to treat all Scripture as “God-breathed” as well as my commitment to the Conservative Hermeneutical Principle, it is not enough for me to demonstrate how violent depictions of God bear witness to the cross. Since the cross leads me to deny that God acted violently in any biblical narrative of divine judgment, I must offer some alternative account of who brought about the violence that is attributed to God in these narratives. We have seen that this is unproblematic in narratives in which violently inclined people function as instruments of God’s judgments (vol. 2, chs. 16<br>

  Book Title: Memories of Asaph-Mnemohistory and the Psalms of Asaph<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Jacobson Karl N.<br>
  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N. Jacobson identifies these Psalms as containing cultic historiography, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  Abstract: It has been shown that the Asaphite Psalms (50 and 73–83) exhibit the most concentrated collection of historical referents in the Psalter. This material is distinctive both in terms of its content (when compared to other Levitical collections and other individual psalms) and in its function. In the cultic poetry of the Asaphite material in particular, there is a ritualization of the act of shared remembering, engendered through recourse to the record of historical subjects or moments. The historical referents embodied in the Asaphite collection serve to preserve and pass on Israel’s historical memory and to establish a cultic<br>

  Abstract: Any account of the relation between myth and literature has a responsibility first to define “myth.” And there, with historical stubbornness, lies not merely a problem, but perhaps the entire subject of myth studies. On the one hand, there is a question as to what myths actually refer to, since they have come to mean many things, from primitive and sacred ritual to propaganda and ideological statements. On the other, there is a good deal of confusion and conflicting argument over how to define the significance of myth. Is it primarily a matter of thematics, or form, or function—or<br>

To the reader who might think that we are about to launch into a question of restricted and basic motor physiology, that is, far removed from cognitive function, I would say that posture is none other than “preparation to act,”¹ and locomotion is not only about making successive steps but also navigating in space.

  Abstract: For the literature of the eighteenth century, particularly for those works that are seen as part of the Enlightenment, critics have foregrounded the moral, didactic interest of these texts. In the Enlightenment view, literature is supposed to serve a purpose (cf. Pizer, 2005, p. 91), and literary texts are always understood in terms of their function as serving moral goals. This penchant for the usefulness of literature is not very surprising: The Enlightenment defines itself as a movement towards greater intellectual independence and moral instruction – leading mankind out of its ‘selfinflicted immaturity’.² Hence the Enlightenment tends to explain the (ever-noticeable)<br>

  Abstract: It may be useful to introduce at this point in the flow of our general narrative the following question: Is the current situation (in the first decade of the twenty-first century) entirely unique? Does humanity encounter it for the first time without any prior analogy? Is the dialectic between convulsive and buzzing relativity and separate zones of serene isolation totally unexpected? I said in a previous chapter that history may well be understood as a succession of unpredictable episodes, so devised or prepared by divine providence (or not), and that such episodes are meant to function each time as fresh,<br>

  Abstract: Agents—specifically, human beings—think, and they do so in accordance with

Yet well before considering that well-known, and vexing, difficulty, it is of some use to determine the precise (if only purported) function of a given rule, as well as its modal “status,” in order to see if any application of that rule can be justified: in Kant’s language, to establish the scope and limits of a rule and, in turn, a<br>

  Abstract: The German philosopher Josef pieper (1904–1997) continues to provoke among his contemporaries constructive, critical, and especially fruitful discussion on anthropological and ethical questions. He does this by formulating a defense of culture, which he contrasts with a pragmatic way of thinking that reduces the person to a specific role and function, to proletarian status. His thought is expressed in a lively style unfettered by any jargon or technical terminology—in contrast with much scholarly writing coming out of today’s universities.

  Abstract: One of the most arresting traits of film noir is its depiction of male protagonists who lack the qualities (courage, incorruptibility, tenacity, and dynamism) that characterize the archetypal American hero and who therefore function as antiheroes. Typical noir male protagonists are weak, confused, unstable, and ineffectual, damaged men who suffer from a range of psychological neuroses and who are unable to resolve the problems they face. Noir’s depiction of its male protagonists—what Frank Krutnik calls its “pervasive problematising of masculine identity”—is expressive of a fundamentally existentialist view of life.¹ As Robert Porfirio argues, noir’s “nonheroic hero” is such<br>

  Book Title: Homo Narrans-The Poetics and Anthropology of Oral Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Niles John D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be difficult to imagine what human life would be like without stories-from myths recited by Pueblo Indian healers in the kiva, ballads sung in Slovenian market squares, folktales and legends told by the fireside in Italy, to jokes told at a dinner table in Des Moines-for it is chiefly through storytelling that people possess a past. In
      Homo NarransJohn D. Niles explores how human beings shape their world through the stories they tell. The book vividly weaves together the study of Anglo-Saxon literature and culture with the author's own engagements in the field with some of the greatest twentieth-century singers and storytellers in the Scottish tradition. Niles ponders the nature of the storytelling impulse, the social function of narrative, and the role of individual talent in oral tradition. His investigation of the poetics of oral narrative encompasses literary works, such as the epic poems and hymns of early Greece and the Anglo-SaxonBeowulf, texts that we know only through written versions but that are grounded in oral technique. That all forms of narrative, even the most sophisticated genres of contemporary fiction, have their ultimate origin in storytelling is a point that scarcely needs to be argued. Niles's claims here are more ambitious: that oral narrative is and has long been the chief basis of culture itself, that the need to tell stories is what distinguishes humans from all other living creatures.<br>

Indeed, recent years have seen an increasing interest in the politics of place, the cultural function of geography, and the reassertion of the importance of space in any cultural study. The territory of these arguments is marked out in diverse areas in the work of people like Michel Foucault, Gaston Bachelard, David Harvey, Edward Soja, Doreen Massey, Fredric Jameson, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel de<br>

In a statement meant to be a general pronouncement on poetics, he argues that the “poetic function” of language is actualized as a “focus on the message for its own sake,” specifically the structure of the message, and “since linguistics is the global science of verbal structure, poetics may be regarded as an integral part of linguistics.”¹ And just as his phonology involves a repression of the continuous and material nature of speech<br>

  Abstract: In 1935, Roman Jakobson noted that all art is influenced by an overarching principle, what the Russian Formalists called the “dominant” (1971 : 82), a structuring orientation characterizing a work or even an entire epoch. Although a narrative may have many functions and embody several forms, an internal hierarchy exists which determines the relative value of its components. The dominant of poetic language is the aesthetic function—its form. Poetry is oriented toward the sign, while prose narrative is directed toward the referent.¹ “Poetic evolution,” says Jakobson, “is a shift in this hierarchy.”<br>

But only a few songwriters have produced such intimate and melancholic sound souvenirs of their personal memories of the radio as the Irish bard Van Morrison. Already in his 1960s hits “Caravan” and “Brown Eyed Girl,” the transistor radio was celebrated as a catalyst and mediator of strong personal feelings and emotions, mainly through its function of putting revolutionary sounds into the air. In several of his later songs, the radio became an object of technostalgic contemplation.²<br>

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

Generally, the feral can be understood as a state that lies somewhere between domesticated and wild.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

If the latter appears for many reasons to constitute something “transient and un-archivable” (Ernst, 2004 and 2010), it is because it presents itself ontologically in an exponentially complex form. In other words, the aim is to underline the problems (theoretical and methodological) that media art poses to digital archiving. In order to keep media artworks accessible to contemporary and future users, their inclusion in digital archives is desirable. Digital archives can support the fundamental function of the

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s M~<br>

Peter Berger summed it up thus: “The impact of modernity on religion is commonly seen in terms of the process of secularization, which can be described as one in which religion loses its hold on the level both of institutions and of human consciousness.”¹ Berger’s harsh assessment may well describe the state of the Korean Protestant church today.

This may seem surprising, at first sight, in a philosopher noted above all, in his own days and in ours, for his heretical opinions with respect to the fundamental doctrines of both the Hebrew and the Christian religions. Nonetheless, Bruno’s Biblical references do not appear to have a merely rhetorical or ornamental function, nor do they express a purely ironical or satirical attitude toward the Biblical texts, although they are certainly eccentric with respect<br>

This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

  Abstract: Not advocating its own utopian alternative to current social realities, meta-utopian fiction investigates the function of a deep human impulse to imagine, project, and enforce alternative social orders. Clowes examines the technical innovations meta-utopian writers have made in style, image, and narrative structure that inform fresh modes of social imagination. Her analysis leads to an inquiry into the intended and real audiences of this fiction, and into the ways its authors try to move them toward more sophisticated social discourse.<br>

  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Abstract: Aphorism, while constituting a literary genre
                  per se,can function concomitantly with a different genre — for example, the novel. Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention. Once a reader becomes conscious of their rhetorical and semantic content, a novel’s aphorisms might do little more than support a traditional reading of the<br>

We have ample evidence, especially from Papuan and Austronesian languages, of the high proportion of spatial indices in speech.

To qualify as a star, the scale of celebrity must be such that the performer’s name and image are familiar not just to those within their specialised field (for example, film enthusiasts, sports fans, intellectuals), but to the general public. For a society to produce stars, and for stars to play an important role in the definition of values and identities, certain conditions are required. Not all human cultures have privileged individualised personality over social function in<br>

  Abstract: Towards the end of ‘The Function and Field of Speech and Language in Psychoanalysis’, the so-called ‘Rome Discourse’ published in

  Author(s) Evans John H.<br>
  Abstract: Synthetic biology is the field whose aim is “to extend or modify the behavior of organisms and engineer them to perform new tasks” (Andrianantoandro et al. 2006).¹ Descriptions of the field vary, of course, but generally, synthetic biology involves one of two approaches: building living organisms from raw materials, and building organisms from parts already found in living organisms. The first “uses unnatural molecules to reproduce emergent behaviors from natural biology, with the goal of creating artificial life,” and the second “seeks interchangeable parts from natural biology to assemble into systems that function unnaturally” (Benner and Sismour 2005).<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle ~<br>

While all cities, as the director Tim Etchells notes, function in the same mode as theatre, as a model of ‘dynamic relativism … where everything means more than one thing’ (2009, p. xii), in Barcelona performance serves as a mode of conceptualizing self and other, of reinforcing the transformative potential of the city – not insignificant in a city that has re-envisaged its own architectural landscape in the past thirty years.<br>

Although originally meant as an assessment of the cultural function of modern art, Sontag’s juxtaposition of such antithetical terms as “noise” and “silence” places the work of art at a stylistic and thematic crossroads where the explicit and the implicit, the visible and the invisible, text and subtext or, indeed, what is said, shown, or done (and therefore “noisy”) and what is not, can meet and interact.

Of what does the audience need to be persuaded? – the truthfulness, authenticity and plausibility of what is presented. This association of sound with a rhetorical function (persuasion) underscores sound’s relation to the image in documentary film as one of support. Working in a subordinate role, sound, it is thought, enhances and consolidates the tasks set by the image; the soundtrack is simply part of<br>

It might not be the emphasised uniqueness of expression that makes the deployment of (for want of better terminology) a highly conventional phrase poetic, precisely because the<br>

  Abstract: Actively reading or analysing images is an uncommon experience even though – or perhaps because – in a visual culture everyone sees thousands of them everyday. Pictures, with or without words, are presented in newspapers, in advertising, on TV and elsewhere, yet when discussing images we have to turn exclusively to words. It is in language that social meaning-making occurs and appraising images is a function of language. However, every seeing child encounters images before learning language and the subject has a complex relationship with the visual field that needs exploring before we consider the meaning of particular images.<br>

  Abstract: Classical rhetoric distinguishes three classes of genre: the judicial (

According to the ideal-typical classification scheme, judicial oratory is focused temporally on the past, and thematically on justice or injustice, and its function is to accuse or defend. Deliberative rhetoric is associated with the future, thematically with expediency or harmfulness, and functionally with exhorting or dissuading. Finally, epideictic oratory is linked to the present, thematically to honor and disgrace and functionally to praise or blame (cf. Plett 1989, pp. 15f.).<br>

  Book Title: Material Inscriptions-Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Warminski Andrzej<br>
  Abstract: This monograph provides readings of literary and philosophical texts that work through the rhetoric of tropes to the material inscription at the origin of these texts. The book focuses on the practice and pedagogical value of rhetorical reading. Its readings follow an itinerary from poetic texts (such as those by Wordsworth and Keats) through theoretical or philosophical texts (by Descartes and Nietzsche) to narrative fiction (by Henry James). The book also contains two essays on Paul de Man and literary theory and an interview on the topic of "Deconstruction at Yale." All three of these latter texts are explicitly about the inescapable function and importance of the rhetoric of tropes for any critical reading or literary study worthy of the name. As Andrzej Warminski demonstrates, ‘rhetorical reading’ is a species of ‘deconstructive reading’—in the full ‘de Manian’ sense—but one that, rather than harkening back to a past over and done with, would open the texts to a different future. Key Features: New readings of texts by Wordsworth, Keats, Descartes, Nietzsche, and Henry James Essays and an interview on Paul de Man and ‘Deconstruction at Yale’ Reflects on and exemplifies the pedagogical value of ‘de Manian’ rhetorical reading Attempts to open a future for 'deconstructive' or 'de Manian' reading<br>

He accomplished this by using a formula he had found in an eighteenth-century mathematics text.² Two years later, three other theorists—Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen—independently suggested that Veneziano’s redeployment of this antique mathematical function implied that the particles that formed the nuclei of atoms were not actually zero-dimensional point-particles, but<br>

This is a point worth stressing: theories do offer explanations—that being their manifest function, after all—but on a prior and deeper level, they define political concepts for

  Abstract: Whether or not we remember our dreams upon waking, it is part of the human condition to dream when we sleep. For some of us, this natural brain function brings powerful somatic experiences that demand our immediate attention. Those images that haunt us long after the visual stimulus has disappeared are often very vivid somatic sensations that rush through our bodies and shock us into an awareness of a highly significant psychic process at work within us. In dreamtime, an embodied image can be experienced on a somatic level with a wide variety of possible manifestations. These physical responses of<br>

On account of their capacity to see other species as the humans that these species see themselves as, Amazonian shamans play the role of cosmopolitical diplomats in an arena where diverse socionatural interests are forced to confront each other. In this sense, the function of the shaman is not entirely different from that of a warrior.

The main reference point for American academics is New Criticism, which long ago triumphed both over historical scholarship and over doctrinally based political and social commentary. Protest over the war in Vietnam stirred recollections of these earlier debates about the historical context and social function of both literature and criticism, but masked the simultaneous and more enduring infusion of European theory into American criticism.

But Gondry’s film leaves romance as the concern of two individuals. The love between Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) undoubtedly has political implications, but the film doesn’t explore them. Instead, it focuses solely on configuring romance through antagonism rather than by attempting to surmount antagonism. This focus lies at the heart of the film’s effectiveness, and at the same time creates an opening for another film to lay out the political<br>

In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence.

In so doing, he quoted the title of a book by Ernst Cassirer (to which he has referred on many other occasions, as well). The latter’sSubstance and Function(2003 [1910]) addresses precisely this transition from substance, which may be “heard” or “seen”(vernehmbare Substanz), to function, which admits comparison (or, alternatively, represents functional equivalence).

  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: In this groundbreaking book, David Roberts sets out to demonstrate the centrality of the total work of art to European modernism since the French Revolution. The total work of art is usually understood as the intention to reunite the arts into the one integrated whole, but it is also tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. The synthesis of the arts in the service of social and cultural regeneration was a particularly German dream, which made Wagner and Nietzsche the other center of aesthetic modernism alongside Baudelaire and Mallarmé.<br>

The frame, with its separating and isolating function, appears as the antithesis of the lost unity of the arts—the recurrent reminder that the commercialization of production and the privatization of reception<br>

  Book Title: Edinburgh German Yearbook 9-Archive and Memory in German Literature and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Dora<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, the discourse of memory - and of German memory culture in particular - has become increasingly concerned with questions of the archive. An archive can refer to a physical place, the material found there, or the system that orders this material; in its broadest sense, it might refer to something public (records housed in a municipal building), or something private (photographs in a family album). The material and documentary qualities of the archive confer on it an authenticating function attributed only cautiously to memory, but theories of the archive have questioned the status of material, documentary vestiges of the past. Memory and the archive are inextricably linked, but how does this affect the mediation of the past? This volume explores the changing relationship between memory and the archive in German-language literature and culture since 1945. Contributions approach this topic from a range of perspectives (film, visual culture, urban culture, digital technology, as well as literature) and offer illuminating studies of Harun Farocki, Anselm Kiefer, Thomas Demand, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Jürgen Fuchs, Stefan Wolter, and Sasa Stanisic.

  Abstract: If the medieval did not function in the early eighteenth century, as it does in our own time, as a historical or chronological category, then how exactly did it work? I argued in the previous chapter that in actual linguistic usage, the term 
                  moyen âge often served as a literary or linguistic term, as reflected also in the common use of the accompanying adjective barbare to describe the period. In this chapter, elaborating on this notion of the medieval as a non-historical concept, I argue that during the early eighteenth century, the medieval came to embody essentially a moral category<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Abstract: Narratives of the past are inevitably subjective. They reflect prevailing structures of power and encode the social and cultural discourses in which they are conceived. This is particularly the case where cultural canons are concerned. Canons embody contemporary values and effectively function, as Paul Lauter observes, as “a means by which culture validates social power.”¹ This phenomenon can be perceived clearly in the constructs of the musical canon that pervaded in the early years of the German Democratic Republic. Portrayals of composers such as Bach, Handel and Beethoven as precursors of socialism reinforced official narratives of the GDR as the<br>

  Abstract: As in the preceding decades, the development of the French-Canadian novel after 1918 was closely connected to the nationalism of Quebec’s Catholic intelligentsia: In 1866 Abbé Henri-Raymond Casgrain demanded that the novel should advocate the French language and Catholicism, as well as concentrate on regional themes, country life, and the memory of Nouvelle-France. Camille Roy’s speech “La nationalisation de la littérature canadienne,” held in 1904 in the Société du parler français, built upon Casgrain’s theses and led the way for virtually all novels produced until 1930.

  Abstract: In untangling this complicated subject it will be helpful to resort to a simplified schema, founded upon the following point of departure: that religion—Serbian Orthodoxy, in this particular context—defines man and his place in the universe. In order to function effectively, it is essential that a person or group have a precisely focused and systematically conceived definition of its environment and of itself. Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity.

Correspondingly, for some time I have had the strong impression that the idea of solidarity on our continent of Europe serves the same function as the idea of peace did shortly before World War II.

  Abstract: The authors—recognized historians, ethnologists, folklorists coming from four continents—present the latest research findings on the relationship, coexistence and conflicts of popular belief systems, Judeo-Christian mythology and demonology in medieval and modern Europe. The present volume focuses on the divergence between Western and Eastern evolution, on the different relationship of learned demonology to popular belief systems in the two parts of Europe. It discusses the conflict of saints, healers, seers, shamans with the representatives of evil; the special function of escorting, protecting, possessing, harming and healing spirits; the role of the dead, the ghosts, of pre-Christian, Jewish and Christian spirit-world, the antagonism of the devil and the saint.<br>

  Abstract: As demonstrated in Chapter Two, although often the constitutional text itself offers no readily available solutions to particular problems, the quest for legitimacy in constitutional adjudication finds refuge in the constitutional text. Theories of constitutional interpretation resort to the text of a constitutional provision as a yardstick to evaluate or establish the appropriateness of a given construction of the constitution in a specific case. The constitutional text is believed to fulfill this legitimizing function, despite constitutionalists’ awareness of the open texture of constitutional provisions, the ghost of indeterminacy, and the admittedly extra-textual (contextual) characteristics of the overwhelming majority of arguments<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: Successive amputations of the body have been accompanied by an increasing precision concerning the part of flesh necessary for personal identity. Initially, there was an indeterminate portion of matter, which early on adopted the form of a seminal particle. Because embryology alone was incapable of accounting for identity, the seminal particle assumed some features of the brain. Endowed with a double function, the “germ” was entirely responsible for the postmortem development of resurrected persons as psychosomatic unities. But why bother with the body? All we need for Judgment Day is an accountable and conscious personality. To the extent that the brain is responsible for it, why not limit resurrection to the brain? And why not go a step further? If only part of the brain is necessary to be a
         person,shall we need it whole to enjoy the beatific vision?126Maybe just a fraction will suffice. This fraction will have to contain the information necessary for defining the self. A computer program might therefore be enough. The resurrectedIneed be nothing other than the computer equivalent of my brain. In this way, thanks to the progress of technology, to resurrect might eventually mean to be emulated by supercomputers; thus resurrected, we shall inhabit a hereafter whose technical name is cyberspace.127But how much can “we” disembody ourselves without becoming simulacra? Are we still “us” in a state of “postorganic” immortality?128<br>

Abstract: Linguistic anthropology is not a unified field, but it does have some commonly held theoretical views and practices. Many have been consistent over time. Two obvious ones are the importance of learning a field language and the importance of collecting language data, understood broadly as anything from eliciting text to recording naturally occurring speech, for a variety of research aims. As for a general model of language as culture, there is a clear shared sense that language is structured and structuringthat it is a cultural practice both deriving from and helping to constitute society and culture. Linguistic phenomena have unconscious character (as Boas argued) as well as regularities of communicative practice and certain persistent features of reference (Sapir
         1949:104) that function in the production of shared meaning or some approximation of it. Well before the linguistic anthropologists of Durantis third paradigm started thinking about practice theory and performativity, Sapir articulated this view: While we often speak of society as though it were a static structure defined by tradition it is only apparently a static sum of social institutions; actually it is being reanimated or creatively reaffirmed from day to day by particular acts of a communicative nature which obtain among the individuals participating in it.b[1931]<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Abstract: However, all the interactions described above, relating to the functioning of this extended body, will totally disappear in the official text handed to me. Even though, as I tried to show previously,
         62Hawking attaches his singular and mortal being to the Corporation of Scientific Geniuses by using his mortal body to place himself in the tradition of his peers,63to establish the paternity of his ideas,64or to justify the choice of his fields of research,65he also effaces all physical evidence of his mortal body, despite its indispensability in the production of this paper. Indeed, Hawking is able to switch between thetalkandwritefunctions of the software. When the program is set towrite,what he composes is stored in a file as in a word processor, but when set ontalk,things are just written, said, and then cleared. Thus, sleeping like the unconscious, the computer’s memory is an immense repository of formal written articles, lectures, and interviews, while all the words concerning informal interactions evaporate, depending on whether or not Hawking deems them worthy of being saved. Accordingly, owing to the computer, I could “see” the (non)simultaneous functioning of these three bodies; owing to the same computer (assuming for example that Hawking had sent me his history by post), we might not have been able to “see” how the dissociation between these three bodies takes place. That is, how Hawking, through the mediation of the machine, could both make his extended body function and, as he responded to my questions, construct his identity as Stephen Hawking, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, while at the same time, as the interview moved towards its completion, effacing all presence of his physical body, the people who surround him, and even me. In his case, the noise and the conditions that made the interview possible were filtered out, not (just) afterwards by the analyst, as it is usually done, but during the interview itself.

Abstract: For instance, when I find myself in a medicalized situation (e.g., admittance to the hospital, removal of clothing, transfer to surgery, the reading of test results, submission to treatment), I become a medical object. Or more precisely, the hospital technology’s inevitable hold of power over me eliminates in me anything that will not reduce to a medical object. Under the gaze of medical personnel, and very soon under my own gaze, the treatment of my sick body will lead to its interpretation according to the parameters of physical bodies (size, quantification, measurements, etc.), with the result that my living flesh will disappear. Soon I will no longer feel the fact that I feel myself: anesthesia will not only deliver me from my pain, but also from my suffering self, and thus from my self’s self‐suffering. Next, every nonobjective function will disappear from this self (me), and my flesh, or that which is animated within me, will become an animal‐machine. This medical definition of my body as an object will also allow for the distinction of health from sickness in terms of norms. Thus is opened the fearful region in which man can make decisions about the normality, and thus the life and death, of other human beings—because these human beings have become simple human objects.<br>

Abstract: Looking back on the critique of rhetoric that emerged in early modernity, it is evident that it was just the motive of persuasion that came to be suspect. In a prescient hypothesis about the significance of this development, Wilbur Samuel Howell argues in his history of British rhetoric that the originality of Adam Smith’s
         Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettresconsisted in his “position that the new rhetoric must define its function as broadly communicative rather than narrowly persuasive.”32At last, a theory of communication! To communicate, in whatever genre of speech or writing, means that Itransmitmy thoughts or sentiments to you with minimal loss (or, as we say now, noise).33To persuade does not require that you know my thoughts or sentiments at all, only that you believe what I want you to believe or feel what I want you to feel. It is on the basis of this distinction that rhetoric was indicted, as a corruption of the communicative function, which was in a real sensediscoveredin the very process of formulating the critique.<br>

Abstract: An increase in knowledge and religious sensitivity has thus revealed the representations of the religious “other” in opposition to which Christianity has traditionally defined itself to be little more than projections of an underlying desire to establish religious identity.
         59Thoughtful comparison exposes this basic need to establish religious identity by invalidating many of the representations through which this need has been at once expressed and concealed. We might say that comparative theology represents the demythologization of apologetics, where demythologization is understood in Rudolf Bultmann’s sense as the recognition of an expressive function underneath an appearance of objective description. So just as Bultmann sought to demythologize the New Testament by explicating the mode of being‐in‐the‐world expressed through a mythical world picture,60so too the comparative theologian recognizes the expressive intent beneath the often questionable comparisons of traditional apologetics. The analogy with Bultmann’s demythologization project calls attention to a point about this conception of comparative theology that brings it into line with Clooney’s, namely, that it does not imply an outright rejection of apologetics. Comparative theology can be regarded as the attempt to salvage what is legitimate in apologetics, namely, the desire to preserve the integrity of a particular religious community by establishing its cognitive boundaries. This conception of comparative theology as a demythologized apologetics thus acknowledges the legitimacy of a sociopolitical dimension to religion. Through judicious comparisons, comparative theology brings into relief the defining features of the Christian community. Yet this aspect of comparative theology differs from traditional apologetics in that it distinguishes a desire to define the Christian faith from a perceived need to refute the teachings of other faith communities. To the extent that comparative theology succ~<br>

Abstract: Meyers is not so naive as to hold that careful screening and imaginative trope play will automatically yield a liberatory model of individual agency. She insists that the self‐figurations that “survive this vetting must become embedded in the cognitive, emotional, and corporeal structures that shape agency and that function as criteria of self‐appraisal. To agentically integrate dissident self‐figurations, women must command skills that enable them to invest emotionally in these tropes and to reconfigure their embodied values as well as their patterns of thought and volition in accordance with them” (55). How? Partly through changes in child‐rearing practices and the social order more generally, but Meyers’s view presumes that the skills for emotional investment and revision of values and volition are already available to most women. However, it can be argued that many women lack these skills and find it arduous to embed new figurations in their cognitive, emotional, and corporeal selves. It is hard to see how any amount of screening and play will take us from image to agency. A more productive approach would be to focus on developing those skills (including through changes in the social order), but that option is constrained in part by the predominance of the very imagery of which Meyers is critical. She uses commanding language in her argument for experimentation with new subjectivities—women
      mustscreen,mustviscerally imagine,mustembed new self‐images,mustcommand skills. This makes it easy to miss her recognition of the insufficiency of such measures, as does the relative lack of detailed proposals for restructuring the social order. Yet one cannot simply flout the power of cultural images in women’s lives. By exposing the feedback loop between self‐image and agentic skills in a patriarchal order, Meyers establishes that image and agency are not two distinct paths. Her emphasis may be on imagery, but it is clear that image and large‐scale political change mu~<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Abstract: To trouble the categories of biological kinship, Haraway draws on the figure of the vampire. The vampire “both promises and threatens racial and sexual mixing” and “feeds off the normalized human” (
         1997b, 214). Suggestive of violence, pollution, and mixing, the vampire is a figure for the alien, the immigrant, and the cosmopolitan and is embroiled in racism, sexism, and homophobia. The figure of the vampire clearly facilitates Haraway’s inquiry into leakages among kinship categories. Yet like the cyborg, the figure also tends to become, like whiteness, everything and nothing at once. Haraway asks, in response toTimemagazine’s 1993 cover of a morphed portrait of a woman’s face created by a computer mixing of different races, a figure she labels SimEve, “Nothing here is scary, so why am I trembling?” (1997b, 264). In a similar manner, I ask about the figure of the vampire: Everything is so messy, so why am I so suspicious? My suspicion arises from the ease with which Haraway’s use of the vampire allows us to be on the other side of kinship and the dramas of identity and reproduction. As Haraway concludes in her chapter, “I believe that there will be no racial or sexual peace, no livable nature, until we learn to produce humanity through something more and less than kinship. I think I am on the side of the vampires, or at least some of them” (1997b, 265). But where and how, within the specific matrices of racial and gendered/sexual oppression, can vampirism be a choice? I suggest that like the postmodern figure of the cyborg, the vampire, recuperated metaphorically for illegitimacy and racial crossing, can function to metaphorize the specificities of race and sex out of existence and once again make room for universalizing analogy.<br>

Abstract: The critics of pluralism who approach the question of religious difference from a cultural‐linguistic or “postliberal” perspective, notably George Lindbeck, Paul Griffiths, and J. A. DiNoia, claim that, just as each language constitutes a semiotic “world” not reducible to another, religious traditions form culturally and linguistically distinct communities of discourse and practice that are mutually incommensurable.
         4Religious scriptures and doctrines, they contend, function both as the rules shaping and governing the communal life of each religious community and as the “lens” through which everything is interpreted and reinscribed “intratextually” within its semiotic world. Such a grammatical and interpretive function of scriptures and doctrines, they argue, confers the characteristics of centrality and comprehensiveness upon the truth claims made by religious communities—the characteristics that render those truth claims very difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with one another.5<br>

Abstract: One often hears arguments as to whether one can make significant generalizations about the internal logic of Midrash, or whether it is more nearly an exegetical art with typical formal moves like those to which Robert Alter recently drew attention. A puzzle or a kind of gap in a biblical verse is stated; next, reference is made to verbal or semantic parallels in parts of the Bible distant from the original verse. With their help, one returns to the original verse, often with something like an element of surprise connection—hence the temptation of poststructuralists to see Midrash as an instance if not a paradigm of intertextuality—and so covers the hiatus between verse and problem. There seems to be general agreement among the Rabbis that the literal sense takes priority over any other in this operation (at least until Kabbala), but this seems to be more an insistence on sticking to the recognized range of use of specific biblical words than a self‐conscious appeal to a logical or other, wider frame for interpretation. What the rabbis agree on is not generally as ambitious as, for example, the rule that interpretation covers in three aspects,
            explicatio,meditatio,applicatio, or the distinction between varieties of nonliteral senses. Midrash is unlike Christian theology but may well fill a similar function: showing the community how to use its sacred text, and doing so through the instrument of a kind of instruction that has continuity of form. In each case, the ultimate recipient of instruction is the community, and it is equally true that in each case the instructional activity is itself communally sanctioned. The method of instruction is in each case one of defining the elements of that religion as a semiotic system, and we might say after Max Weber that rabbis and theologians are ideal types. The mode of instruction employed in each case is in the service of the tradition.30<br>

Abstract: “Citatology” nearly always ignores this question, implicitly treating references to an author as an index of recognition (of indebtedness or legitimacy). In point of fact this apparent function may nearly always be associated with such diverse functions as the manifestation of relations of allegiance or dependence, of strategies of affiliation, of annexation or of defence (this is the role, for example, of guarantee references, ostentatious references or alibi‐references).<br>

Abstract: By way of summary: in this article I have argued that interreligious interaction, first of all, should be approached from an observer perspective and, hence, should be placed in an intercivilization context in which human rights can function as a directive for the application of the principles of human dignity, freedom, and equality—all principles that relate to respect and tolerance. This links up with the notion of pluralism in theology of religions. In this context interreligious dialogue can fulfil an important function if it meets three conditions: information exchange in the form of mutual witnessing; perspective exchange, with all the attendant problems; and perspective coordination. Close analysis of this kind of interreligious dialogue reveals two kinds of perspective exchange: that of self‐perspective and other perspective, and that of observer and participant perspective. Here human rights once more act as a criterion: a criterion of truth and justice. This is my attempt at explaining why young people, in test samples of empirical theological research done on different continents, assign pluralism priority over all other approaches, including interreligious dialogue.<br>

Abstract: Ibid. Here the interesting issue of the frequent change of urban and rural place names is being raised. Yet clearly the changing of names and the changing of landmarks, despite being seemingly identical, evoke different emotional responses, although both have had a long historical tradition in all societies. Somehow the changing of names is accepted, no matter whether triumphantly or grudgingly. So is the changing function of a landmark, as long as it is still preserved. In both cases, the signifier is changed, but the signified stays. However, the signified's complete erasure is strongly and passionately contested, probably because of its imposing materiality.<br>

Abstract: Such an endlessly self‐creative social responsibility arguably articulates something profound in the Christian ethical message. The dependency of humanity on God should open each of us to the important ways in which human beings are radically dependent upon one another. Responsibility for children as “the least among us” shines a particularly strong light on what it means to love fellow creatures of God overall. A sense of responsibility to human vulnerability is suggested in the gospel meaning of the golden rule: “Do to others as you would have them do to you” (Luke 6:31). As Ricoeur and others have argued, this formulation implies a double substitution: you are asked to imagine yourself as a recipient of another’s actions so as to understand your own moral agency from another’s point of view.
         53The golden rule puts you in the position of the one responsible, but from the point of view of the one you may potentially victimize. It demands two moral centers at once: yourself and the other. This decentering function of the golden rule is further radicalized by its immediately following Jesus’s extreme love command: “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you” (Luke 6:27–28). The juxtaposition of such an asymmetrical or radical love command on the golden rule protects the latter from being reduced to any easy reciprocity or exchange. It renders moral responsibility a demand for superabundance toward others in the service of realizing a common humanity.<br>

Abstract: These considerations may also help us reflect on the nature of ethics as a disciplinary inquiry. Somewhat like artists, novelists, and even social and physical scientists, ethicists should function, at least in part, as investigators and disrupters of accepted wisdom, imaginers of provocative new moral possibilities, transformers of shared social and cultural worlds, and contributors toward creating more inclusive human meaning. They should do this in creative and fruitful conversation and tension with other disciplines, transforming and being transformed in relation to them.
         39Ethicists can contribute to society in both theoretical and practical ways by challenging ingrained moral ideologies, naming and exposing real social tensions, and innovating new possibilities for social and relational worlds and practices—that is, by engaging their world creatively. This task is already part of the ongoing interpretive conversation of ordinary moral culture. Ethicists may raise social dynamics to higher levels of intentional reflection in the hope of helping humanity better respond to its own primordial poetic capability for “making” this a better world.<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: In response to Patočka’s claim that Christianity has failed to adequately thematize what a Person is—that is, the Person that penetrates the soul with its glance without in turn being seen and that constitutes the soul as a responsible self—Derrida writes that such a reference to “inadequate thematization … seems to appeal to some ultimate adequacy of thematization that could be accomplished” (
      GD,p. 27). Let us remind ourselves of the fact that, in the tradition of responsibility, its Greek moment may come the closest to the ideal of full thematization because it demands knowledge of the reasons, the aim, the meaning of what is done and of the circumstances of one’s decisions or actions. Although Derrida emphasizes that we must be continually aware of the fact that whenever we do not sufficiently thematize whatresponsibilitymeans some irresponsibility insinuates itself into our actions, he also remarks that this is always and everywhere the case. No action, if it is to be a responsible action, is ever consciously or cognitively sufficiently determined. Derrida adds: “One can sayeverywherea priori and nonempirically” (GD,p. 26). If this is so, it is because an action must transcend knowledge to be responsible as well as to include knowledge of what responsibility means. Unless it is the execution of a preestablished theorem or norm, an action merits the titleresponsibleonly if it is also effectuated without full theoretical determination. It follows from this that the thematization of responsibility is, for structural reasons, always lacking—even in the case of the Platonic notion of responsibility rejected by Patočka on the basis that it makes responsibility a function of the knowledge of the good. This is even more the case for the heretically Christian conception of responsibility. Derrida observes that thematization
            
      is, if not denied, at least strictly limited in its pertinence by that other more radical form of responsibility that expos~<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Making room for a more poetic function at work between this reading‐and‐writing prophet and his confirming God allows that “truth,” as Ricoeur has said, “no longer means verification, but manifestation. … What shows itself is in each instance a proposed world, a world I may inhabit and wherein I can project my own most possibilities.”
         98This is the power to which Bloom credited Mormonism’s survival: not Smith’s history making but his “myth‐making imagination at work to sustain so astonishing an innovation.”99It is the power to shape reality, not merely describe it. To the extent that self‐consciousness can be ascribed to him, it is probably why Smith abjured theology for mythmaking. Regardless, scholars who would understand the relative longevity and appeal of his project, especially as it has transcended its American milieu, can ill afford to ignore the capacity of Smith’s narratives to make sense of time.<br>

Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Hacker, “Distinctive Features,” 63–64. When Śaṅkara does find himself speaking of the cosmological product of
            avidyā, namely, name and form (nāmarūpe), in a way suggestive of material causality (i.e., as being the seeds of the samsaric world—saṃsāraprapañcabījabhute), he is quick to assert the difference between these and the Lord (īśvara), thus compromising a bit on the Advaiticananayatvaprinciple. See Shastri,BSūBh, 382, lines 2–4: “sarvajñasyeśvarasyātmabhūta ivāvidyākalpite nāmarūpe tattvānyābhyām anirvacanīye … tābhyām anyaḥ sarvajña īśvaraḥ” (Name and form, inexpressible as either “this” or something other than this, and imagined through ignorance, are, as it were [iva], the nature of the omniscient Lord). Note that the little particleiva(like) here is doing a great deal of theological work: it prevents brahman from collapsing into Sāṃkhya‐esque prime matter. Govindānanda’s comment makes this function of theivaclear (Shastri,BSūBh, 382, lines 16–17): “nāmarūpe ced īśvarasyātmabhūte tarhīśvaro jaḍa ityata āha—tābhyāmanya iti” (If name and form were of the nature of the Lord, then the Lord would be inanimate. Therefore, he says, “Different from these two”).<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: Seen in the light of canon formation, then, re‐vision is a necessary and integral part of canonicity, adding to a canon’s cultural capital rather than transforming or overturning it.
         12Seen from the perspective of the publishers, however, it may well be the interdependency of canonical text and rewrite—its being, as Attridge says, “already canonized”—that makes rewritings particularly interesting. Whereas rewritings have long been known to be a form of productive reception that contributes to the canonicity of texts while deriving critical attention and authority from them, the success of feminist re‐vision in the literary marketplace is equally linked to changes in the book‐publishing industry that are due to the globalization of capital. In the 1970s, the financial success of a publishing house depended on a large publishing list, which was achieved through economies of scale and a high gross margin due to printing a large number of copies in one print run. In the 1980s, capitalism shifted to a model of short‐turnover cycles of capital: short lead times with a small number of copies, low stocks, and regular reprints (Harvey1989). One of the most visible effects of this global shift is that publishers rely increasingly on front lists, generating more and more of their overall sales from fewer books and fewer authors. “Given a choice, publishers would rather release a new title from a bestselling author with a proven customer base than take a chance on a title written by an unknown author,” the executive summary of Simba Information’sBusiness of Consumer Book Publishing 2005report states, adding wryly, “The reasons are pure economics” (Simba Information2005, 2). It is in this post‐Fordist economic context that rewriting emerges as a literary genre that allows for feminist literary and political aims to be realized in a commercially viable form. Indeed, capitalizing on the way in which the canonical work or author functions as a brand name, publishers of rew~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: The vengefulness of Pancks's fiery radicalism, flaring up just two chapters before the end of the book—and thus closer to being a climactic moment in the novel's social counterpoint than one may tend to remember—must somehow be quenched if society is to get on with the business of business as usual, as well as its own patrilineal continuance through marriage. There is no better place to perform this dousing, this ritual cleansing, than at a wedding. Narratology's work is regularly concluded in such a ceremonial event. Narratography alone would keep reading on. What it hears in this case is a stunning concision of phrase at this marriage of the businessman down on his luck and the poorhouse scion moving up—a wedding that requires Mr. Pancks to snuff out his recent asocial fury in order to attend. Such is the legally sanctioned ritual at whose margins he is (parenthetically and proleptically) so richly remunerated for his glancing witness. In the bourgeois novel, quiescence needn't be its own, or only, reward—at least when the system is fully up, oiled, and running. “Mr Pancks”—parenthesis—“(destined to be chief clerk to Doyce and Clennam, and afterwards partner in the house)”—and on the sentence goes, as if earning this fate in advance: Mr. Pancks, “
         sinking the Incendiary in the peaceful friend, looked in at the door to see it done” (LD,p. 785). The preceding run of phonetic irony is accompanied by its own graphic sinking from the capital I of “Incendiary” to the alphabetic as well as temperamental leveling of “friend.”20In its figural and alphabetic economy, that brief participial phrase is one of the great turns in all of Dickens, with its evoked soothing bath in the symbolic font of all fellow feeling. Overseen marital bonding, reduced to the “it” of pro forma social function (“to see it done”), is not only the antecedent but the prototype of those mercantile partnerships (here parenthetically foreordained) that are just as important as familial unions t~<br>

Abstract: Augustine’s polemics are well known but may lead us wrongly to conclude that civic virtue was only one of the many “splendid vices” of pagan thought and culture. We should rather say that, in Augustine’s hands, civic virtue can function as a critical principle or, more precisely, a disposition to practice social criticism. Political elites and cultural authorities who ask citizens to accept unjust practices corrode a “sense of justice,” the virtue of equity and respect for others that should animate social institutions.
         67As a disposition that infuses a common life and inclines us to think about the moral quality of the commonweal, civic virtue describes a quality of mutual interaction that helps to constitute a collective way of being. Civic virtue thus coordinates and deepens an ensemble of collective desires—our “fellow feelings” toward ourselves as citizens linked by shared purposes of the common good.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: The prospect of the decline of those debates in a media studies milieu is more worrisome than the putative mutation of their topic. For our seasoned ability to understand how the movies have functioned and to question how they came to function this way can guide the study of whatever audio‐visions attract our attention.
         65The fact is that many of the best minds in the humanities turned from literary, philosophical, sociocultural, or historical pursuits to account for the most imposing medium of the twentieth century. They produced often complex, ingenious, and passionate arguments and positions. They produced a way of thinking and cultivated an instinct of looking and listening. Even if much of what has been written could be discarded without real loss, this discourse—this drive to understand the workings of films—is precious. To have this subsumed by some larger notion of the history of audio‐visions, to have it dissipate into the foggy field of cultural studies, for instance, or become one testing ground among others for communication studies would be to lose something whose value has always derived from the intensity and the focus that films invite and often demand.<br>

Abstract: Coleridge was deeply influenced by Kant’s approach to Christianity as a fundamentally moral rather than theoretical entity. Yet, equally, Coleridge reacted against much in Kant’s theology.
         31Chief among his objections in this context is the way that Kant makes God little more than a reflex of the moral law. InReligion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Kant had argued that “the doctrine of virtue … subsists of itself (even without the concept of God)” and that “when reverence for God is put first, with virtue therefore subordinated to it, this object … becomes anidol.”32In his desire to assert this priority and to disassociate religion from cultic observance and ceremony, Kant hollowed out much of religious practice. Included in his purification of religious concepts is prayer, which figures a valid moral intention (the so‐called pure spirit of prayer) but is improper in purporting to address God: “In the heart‐felt wish which is the spirit of prayer, man seeks but to work upon himself. … A prayer can be offered with perfect sincerity even though the man praying does not presume to be able to affirm that the existence of God is wholly certain. … Asan address, he supposes this Supreme Being to be present in person … hence such complete sincerity cannot be found in the latter.”33At best, prayer can function as a propaedeutic, quickening our desire to fulfill the moral law, with the aim that “the letter of it … [will] finally fall away.”34At worst, it appears as the solitary indulgence in a fiction, as when Kant imagines a praying man “whom some one else takes unawares. … Everyone will … without my saying so, expect a man thus surprised to fall into confusion or embarrassment … because a man caught talking aloud to himself is suspected of having a slight attack of madness.”35Prayer is thus relegated to an improper margin, both philosophically and indeed textually, existing within a supplementary “General Observation” covering prayer, churchgoing, baptism, and ~<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: For the most part, Franke’s theory of poetic language as negative theology is persuasive and helpful in illuminating the complex relationship between religion and literature. With apocalypse, the two converge: religion needs literary discourse to reveal and reveil the transcendent, and literature performs an apocalyptic function that opens us to new possibilities of speaking, knowing, and being. However, what Franke calls apocalyptic could just as well be identified as metaphorical or symbolic, and for this, greater attention to the allegorical tradition, Romantic literary theory, and the hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur would be helpful. Franke is aware of these connections, but they remain undeveloped.<br>

Abstract: The intensification of divine transcendence, however, did not necessarily establish the conditions for human autonomy. As I suggested above, mystic theologians such as Fénelon formulated a different response to the dilemmas posed by a deity whose motives had become virtually unknowable. In so doing, he departed from the post-Tridentine doctrine that reaffirmed the soul's intrinsic interest in salvation as a function of the natural desire for happiness. Drawing the opposite conclusion, he maintained that the soul was obliged to love God even if it were damned, thus severing the logical and moral connections between human action and the spiritual recompense offered by a hidden deity. On this view, the soul should surrender its possessive attachment to all things, even to itself, so as to make the divine present once more. As he wrote in an undated letter of spiritual direction to Louis XIV's morganatic wife, Madame de Maintenon, “one does not find God purely alone except in this loss of all his gifts, and in this real sacrifice of all of himself, after having lost all interior resources.” Yet radical dispossession returns all that it strips away, insofar as the soul now finds within itself God alone. This presence, Fénelon was careful to note, cannot be regarded as a “gift” but, rather, as “God himself, immediately alone, … who, without being possessed by the soul, possesses it for his own sake.”
         44In its purest form, then, the love of God detaches the human person from any independent claim of autonomous action and takes the place, as an immanent force, of the self's particular existence. As Fénelon made clear in hisTraité de l'existence et des attributs de Dieu(1712, 1718), God's transcendence could give way to a proximity that blurred the boundaries of creator and created. Divine light, he claimed, is “infinitely beyond us,” yet “so familiar and so intimate to us, that we always find it as near to us as we are to ourselves.”45<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: By considering the phenomenon of promise as a kind of gift, we can see that a promise has features of the pure gift advocated by Jacques Derrida as well as the ordinary gift of Marcel Mauss that can engage the economy of give‐and‐take, the circular exchange of gifts. We do not need to take up whether it can solve other problems facing the various forms of gift as they are used in theology and philosophy. To take up promise as gift means that the phenomenon of promise features altruistic or unilateral moments as well as the ability to effectively interact in the economy of equivalence or reciprocity.
         37This is an important challenge that Tillich stated early on. He held that the prophetic is other than the immanent. But if it cannot interact with immanent rationality and positively function in that economy, the prophetic will leave the immanent world of politics untouched. For all its radical difference, the prophetic would have no practical significance.<br>

Abstract: This is already clear in “Literature and the Right to Death,” the essay to which Lévinas was responding in “Reality and Its Shadow.” There Blanchot writes, “where is literature's power? It plays at working in the world, and the world regards its work as a worthless or dangerous game.”
         34Blanchot's rhetoric here is once again remarkably similar to Lévinas's in “Reality and Its Shadow” and is seemingly as negative. Yet what condemns literature for Lévinas redeems it for Blanchot. Ultimately it is the way in which literature deforms action into inaction that gives it its importance. Its function first appears as a resistance to the philosophical concept.<br>

Article Title: Animals, Poetry, Philosophy, and Dante's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: However, the Aristotelian topos of the “sagacity of bees,” found in Bartholomeus Anglicus, Albertus Magnus, Vincent of Beauvais, and Thomas Aquinas, was adopted to signify the wonder of nature.
      70Thus, whether in their natural environment, as parallel to an idealized monastic setting, or linked with the “celestial realm,” bees, as the least animal-like creatures who were deemed closest to the heavenly sphere, offered Dante an image for an idealized golden age, an eschatological future already realized in the natural world. Dante's transfigured golden age, however, is not in the past but in the immanent present of the actions of bees, which as nonhuman creatures most like angels, and as poetic vehicles, make transcendence visible in the immanent world of nature. But there is more here, because Dante's use of the nonhuman animal simile places the immanent creature outside itself, and knowledge of self, and makes this a condition of blessedness to which humans might aspire. This has both an aesthetic and heuristic function because it poses a question about the philosophical boundaries that place man above all other creatures. The fact that the poet chooses insects, bees, birds, or fish and avoids mammals (except of course the lamb) as his vehicles to convey this insight suggests these creatures are more analogous to this “blessed” condition than wolves or other predatory creatures. Mammals, in Dante's bestiary, tend to fall easily into the static allegory/personification realm, in step with the “common association” notion of the metaphor, whereas Dante's similes with insects, bees, birds, or fish show how a close observation of nature can become the poetic means for making the immanent transcendent and the transcendent present in the immanent.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 656725<br>
Date: 01 01, 2011<br>
Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If that is indeed the case, it is our historical duty to realize that the rhetoric of
      Confessionscomprises both sound and silence to the effect that the fullness of voice can sound in such a way that it is possible to say about Augustine—and his reader—that he “did not hear [its] silence.” Is that perhaps the essence of the fact that what Augustine is looking for cannot but be a momentary gift and that the rhetoric of this search in all its loudness comes down to shaping the fact that it cannot be ascertained, beyond the “speech act” ofconfessioitself, whether that which is given sounds or not? Saying this, we do not find ourselves in the realm of mystical silence. We are, rather, faced with the demands of rhetorical precision. For to establish the magic of a language of desire that is given—a language with the power of Kafka's hammer of the facts of life in the shape of the song of the Sirens—confessiohas to be framed and shaped, dramatized and theatricalized. Consequently, the possibility has to be taken into account that the phrase “Ulysses did not hear the silence of the Sirens” is not the final word about the matter, just as the dialectic of speech and silence cannot be taken to function as an automatism.<br>

Abstract: The answer, in fact, is no. First, the film has done us the immense favor of breaking down a thorny question (can there be a movie that is just about flowers?) into its component parts (can one tell the story of a flower? the story of all flowers? and so on). Second, it does us the equally large favor of taking us through each of them in order to rid us of our temptation to embrace any particular one. The thirty minutes of melodrama should be understood not as a crowd-pleasing gesture to which Kaufman reluctantly and guiltily succumbs but rather as a deliberately chosen strategy whose function is, quite the contrary, to cure us of our insatiable appetite for narrative, not by starving it but by satisfying it to excess. And this, third, does us the immeasurable favor of bringing flowers before our suddenly rapt attention, of clearing a space for flowers to fill.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: By characterizing Faustus's magic as efficacious only because his interest in it signified that he was inclined to be damned, Marlowe turned the aesthetic strategies of dramatic forms into instruments that produced effects that seemed to have soteriological consequences. Yet he dramatized the reformers' arguments not because he wrote his play to disciplinary ends (it is hard to imagine Marlowe having an interest in reforming his audience's faith). Rather, Marlowe made the aesthetics of
      Doctor Faustusinstrumental to increase the cultural and material power of his art. He knew full well that immediate, popular, and even naive theatrical experiences motivate the distribution of such power; from an ambitious and brilliantly cunning playwright's point of view, they are the means to that very end. And in writingDoctor Faustus, Marlowe was not just cunning, but fearless. If he argued, as Richard Baines claimed, that “the first beginning of Religion was only to keep men in awe,” it still could not have been an easy thing, when atheism was a felony and religious discourse saturated all of English life, to maintain such a demystifying view of the ideological function of the sacred.40Yet Marlowe used belief in the devil and in God himself as his dramatic instrument to wrench the psychic and social force of religious experience away from its dominant institutional contexts and to place it in the peripheral space of the theater, which he, above all his immediate contemporaries, was creating as a charged, extraordinary, and charismatic social space.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Abstract: Suffused as it is with gentle tones and soft music, the scene is unlike any other in the play.
      
            Some of its elements, however, are familiar. When Lear rouses from sleep, Cordelia offers herself to him as she previously did in the love contest, inviting his gaze and subjecting herself to it. “Sir, do you know me?” (4.6.41), and “O look upon me, sir” (4.6.50). Lear shrinks back, confessing that Cordelia has ample cause to hate him. Her gentle reply is no more than a murmur: “No cause, no cause” (4.6.68). Like the “nothing” of act 1 that it echoes, Cordelia’s “no cause” performs the literal operation of negation or denial. Yet the meaning of her words surpasses their linguistic function.36
         
            Analysis always feels inadequate to Cordelia’s utterance because its meaning, as Levinas would say, lies not in the said (37
         le dit) but in the saying (le dire). What gives “no cause” its significance is not only the content it communicates but also the approach it enacts. Her words will always be in excess of interpretation because Cordelia is not using signs so much as she is making herself a sign, delivering herself to her father in that discursive attitude of sustained exposure and incessant offer that Levinas calls “the very signifyingness of signification.”

Abstract: If metaphor adds nothing to the description of the world, at least it adds to the ways in which we perceive; and this is the poetic function of metaphor. This still rests upon resemblance, but at the level of feelings. In symbolizing one situation by means of another, metaphor “infuses” the feelings attached to the symbolizing situation into the heart of the situation that is symbolized. In this “transference of feelings,” the similarity between feelings is induced by the resemblance of situations. In its poetic function, therefore, metaphor extends the power of double meaning from the cognitive realm to the affective.

Abstract: To literalize this simile, one may use Jakobson’s well-known formalist thesis, with its delimitation of the specificity of poetic language as projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination: “What is the empirical linguistic criterion of the poetic function? In particular, what is the indispensable feature inherent in any piece of poetry? To answer this question we must recall the two basic modes of arrangement used in verbal behavior,
            selectionandcombination…The selection is produced on the base of equivalence, similarity and dissimilarity, synonymity and antonymity, while the combination, the build up of sequences, is based on contiguity.The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection into the axis of combination.Equivalence is promoted to the constitutive device of the sequence. In poetry one syllable is equalized with any other syllable of the same sequence; word stress is assumed to equal word stress, as unstress equals unstress; prosodic long is matched with long, and short with short; word boundary equals word boundary, no boundary equals no boundary; syntactic pause equals syntactic pause, no pause equals no pause. Syllables are converted into units of measure and so are morae or stresses” (Jakobson 1960, 357).<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Abstract: In his description of the palace, Jordy used the expression "folly" in its double meaning. He explained that the term referred to garden structures without any function, erected just to enhance a landscape. He also reminded his readers that in French folly meant madness or silliness. See Jordy,
               American Buildings and Their Architects, 281. Authors of many American architectural history surveys mentioned in the note 2 reinforced the contrast between Maybeck's Arts and Crafts legacy and the classicism of his palace. John Ely Burchard and Albert Bush-Brown,The Architecture of America,235 and 362, present an example of the most negative assessment of the latter. Leland Roth,A Concise History of American Architecture, 214–15, who gave a more sympathetic critique of the palace, still stated that its eclecticism placed it below Maybeck's "more experimental work."<br>

Abstract: Archaeological excavations in the last fifty years have changed this, contributing to a great number of scholarly works in various fields. However, as Wu points out, many art-historical studies of Chinese tombs tend to be formal analyses of individual objects in museum collections, in which little attempt is made to explain an object’s visual characteristics in relation to its original function or symbolism. Following recent trends in Chinese art history, Wu argues that instead of studying discrete objects—which, he implies, compromises the overall “integrity of a tomb”— we should treat the tomb space, artifacts, and images as part of an interrelated whole. More importantly, because tombs make up a unique category of art specifically designed for the dead, not the living, the scholar must reconsider the utility of employing our traditional art-historical methodologies in analyzing tombs (12–13).<br>

Abstract: "The written words of the Adi
Granth function quite differently from the written words of ordinary books or even of other
scriptures. In Sikh devotion, the written words fulfil the same function as that of a musical
score in relation to the performed music. Just as written music has no value until it is per-
formed, so the written text of the Adi Granth has spiritual power only as it is sung. . . . This
is why the devotional experience of scripture cannot be had from translations-just as it
is impossible to translate a Bach fugue into some other form" (p. 134)<br>

Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250429<br>
Date: 12 1, 1968<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein David<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz have been concerned with the notion of human action as text. This text, like all texts, has manifest and hidden meanings. The hidden meanings indicate a "semantic" function of social activities, in the sense that they provide members of a society with readings of their experience, by telling them about themselves, their values, beliefs, and cultures. Ricoeur's and Geertz's ideas are used to examine the notion of "education as text". Because Ricoeur and Geertz stress hidden meaning, their ideas lead us to an analysis of the "hidden curriculum". The hidden curriculum is a reading of an educational text, normally performed by students. However, as Ricoeur argues, texts can be read by anyone. The question then arises: which sort of hidden curriculum is read not only by the students, but by all members of society? What sort of reading of society's experience is provided when education is a text read by all? I propose the hypothesis that education then becomes a text about society's myths and sacred beliefs.<br>

Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Article Title: Against Wholeness: The Ego's Complicity in Religion<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Vergote Volney P.<br>
Abstract: Many students of religion suggest that wholeness or the attainment of an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion is a function of the ego, e.g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of 'wholeness'. I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an egosyntonic desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them.<br>

Issue: i210419<br>
Date: 7 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Klausner Samuel Z.<br>
Abstract: The ways in which values are assimilated to social research differ according to the theoretical frame of reference informing the research. An example from the writings of E. Digby Baltzell illustrates how a moral commitment shaped his assumptions about the nature of the social matrix and his research strategies. A Western moral rhetoric fares well if the researcher chooses a methodologically individualist framework. The framework assists a moral rhetoric by providing it with concrete rather than abstract social actors and with a basis for explanation in terms of motive rather than situational forces. Along the way moral statements can appear in the form of empirical generalizations and historical laws. Should sociologists deem ethically neutral social research desirable, this study suggests that concentration on scientific method, without exploring the value bases for selecting a frame of reference, is not a promising approach. A value analysis, especially around Weber's "value relevance," may function propaedeuticly.<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: Il primo approccio è ben rappresentato da O.Taplin, The Stagecraft of Aeschylus. The
Dramatic Exits and Entrances in Greek Tragedy, Oxford 1977, e Greek Tragedy in Action, Lon-
don 1978; J.P. Vernant e P. Vidal-Naquet, Mito e tragedia nell'antica Grecia. La tragedia come
fenomeno sociale estetico e psicologico, trad. it. Torino 1976 (Paris 1972) rappresenta una pietra
miliare del secondo filone interpretativo la cui novità riesiede soprattutto nell'intelligente
applicazione di strumenti e modelli desunti dalle scienze sociali. Per una recente 'difesa'
di questo filone si veda R. Seaford, 'The Social Function of Attic Tragedy: a Response to
Jasper Griffin', Class. Quart. 50, 2000, pp. 30-44. Per una disamina intelligente e stimolante
dei diversi approcci critici alla tragedia greca, dal diciannovesimo secolo ad oggi, vedi S.
Goldhill 1997 (supra, n. 1). Quello che definisco qui approccio socio-politico comprende
tanto quello che Goldhill definisce il filone strutturalista e antropologico quanto quello più
recente, "post-strutturalista", nella misura in cui entrambi trovano nella struttura socio-

Abstract: Using the example of former Yugoslavia, specifically the Serbian and Croatian nations, this article examines the transformation of collective memory of aggression and victimhood by focusing on the content of national narratives. The article begins by examining narratives developed at the founding of Yugoslavia and proceeds to trace the reinterpretation of these narratives as a function of their political instrumentality—especially in Serbia and Croatia—for respective nationalist projects. In the end, the article provides tools with which to frame two questions: first, whether political and social stability is being created at the cost of forgetting and repression; second, whether a "policy of remembrance" is socially "desirable" in practice. Both forgetting and an instrumental "policy of remembrance" based on the power of revelation perpetuate aggressor—victim divisions: what is needed, rather, is a stable, systematic process of remembrance and reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Abstract: The article analyzes the theoretical reflection of religion throught Durkheim's production from the initial perspectives to The elementary forms of religious life. In his masterpiece particularly, Durkheim presents the most important factors founding a `religious society': the experience of the sacred, the emotional proprieties of rituals and the trascendental function of symbolism. The essay critically discusses, both in sociological and in philosophic terms, potentialities and limits of Durkheim's project.<br>

Abstract: Research on information sharing has viewed this activity as essential for informing groups on content relevant to a decision. We propose and examine an alternate function of information sharing, i.e., the social construction of meaning. To accomplish this goal, we turn to social construction, social presence, and task closure theories. Drawing from these theories, we hypothesize relationships among the meeting environment, breadth and depth of information shared during a meeting, and decision quality. We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication. Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth. Finally, the findings indicate that when in multimedia environments and faced with a relatively complex task, choosing to utilize an electronic medium facilitates closure and, therefore, favorable outcomes.<br>

Abstract: À partir la distinction des trois sens de la conscience dans la Cinquième Recherche logique de Husserl, nous tâchons d'évaluer les rapports entre conscience, impression et réflexion. Seule la prise en compte de la temporalité immanente de la conscience permet de comprendre l'articulation des trois. Mais on souligne la fonction de connaissance et d'unification égologique qui confère à la réflexion un poids méthodologique considérable dans la phénoménologie de Husserl comme dans la pensée du jeune Fink. Enfin, la critique de Michel Henry permet de préciser à quelles conditions le niveau préréflexif ou impressionnel peut acquérir une teneur propre, voire une relative autonomie. This study has its departure point in Husserl's distinction of three concepts of consciousness (Fifth Logical Investigation); it seeks to evaluate the relationship between consciousness, impression and reflection. Their articulation requires that the immanent temporality of consciousness be taken into account. At the same time, this paper stresses the cognitive function and the egological meaning of reflection, which explain its considerable methodological weight in Husserl's phenomenology and in the early thought of Fink. Finally, Michel Henry's objections enable us to establish to what extent the pre-reflective, impressional level can be credited with consistency and autonomy.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Abstract: The method adopted in this study of Meir Shalev's poetics involves the simultaneous application of two complementary theories: the theory of literary mythopoesis (based on Aleksei Losev's personalistic theory of myth) and the theory of the origins of signs, language and culture developed by Eric Gans. It is shown that images of incorporated memory in the novel function as synergetic mechanisms both of turning signs into personalities and of turning personalities into signs. The unity of the body and memory representations appears to be the prominent feature of Shalev's postmodern fiction, which serves as the significant step in the development of magical realism in Israeli literature.<br>

Author(s): Stawarska Beata<br>
Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: This article studies the institutional context of recent reforms in ecclesiastical faculties, with special attention to the transformation of modern Universities. Four major problems are raised in this period of University renewal. 1) Should Universities stress research or teaching functions? 2) Should they admit the mass of students or be reserved to an elite? 3) How can they organize efficiently the University community? 4) What is their responsibility towards the collectivity? With regard to the first question, the author notes the current emphasis on research as compared to teaching. A reasonable balance between these two functions may be attained by drawing from philosophies of education within the English, French, German and American traditions. A rewarding survey of recent University legislation in various countries is made. The post-industrial era calls for a stress on research in such a way as to link it more effectively with the teaching function of the University. As to the second question, youth today assumes its right to a University education. Universities can neither receive all candidates nor, on the other hand, systematically impose a « numerus clausus ». Selectivity is necessary. A system of diversified Colleges, Universities and Faculties would permit everyone with the prerequisite aptitudes to receive a University training. Planning would be necessary among the institutions of a given region. A system of gradual and qualified selection is suggested. The third problem concerns the University as a community. Recent reforms require effective collaboration among all the components of the University: administrators, professors, students. All should have some voice in university government. More important than structures is the mentality which will effect a genuine solidarity and consensus among all members of the University community. The fourth problem regards the University's relationship to the collectivity. The University must protect its academic~<br>

Abstract: Abordaremos a autobiografia de Malcolm X (1925-1965) sob o prisma de uma hermenêutica do testemunho: ao aplicar a hermenêutica do testemunho na referida autobiografia, identificaremos as duas profundas transformações psicológicas e espirituais sofridas por Malcolm X, transformações indissociáveis de uma mudança na sua relação com a transcendência, o Islamismo e a comunidade afro-americana do seu tempo. Trata-se, em última análise, de percorrer a evolução de uma consciência humana que se cumpre e se manifesta na religiosidade (não-violência) e no testemunho. Neste estudo, o rito aparecerá como "passagem" no contexto da (re-)integração e (re)educação segundo o modelo da adoração (Mestre/discípulo), mediada pelo desejo mimético, cuja função é purgativa e fundacional porque reorientadora da existência do discípulo. O rito será visto ainda como "sinal da aceitação do testemunho". No contexto de testemunho, extrairemos ainda uma noção de coragem, integrante de noções contemporâneas. We will approach the autobiography of Malcolm X (1925-1965) from the point of view of a hermeneutics of testimony: on applying the hermeneutics of testimony in the said autobiography, we will identify the two deep psychological and spiritual transformations suffered by Malcolm X, transformations that can't be separated from a change in his relationship with the transcendence; the Islamism and the African American community of his time, being, ultimately, the go through of the evolution of human consciousness that meets and manifests itself in religion (non-violence) and witness. In this study, the rite will appear as "passage" in the context of (re-) integration and (re-)education according to the model of worship (master/disciple), taking part in the mimetic desire, whose function is purgative and functional because reorienting the existence of the disciple, the rite is still seen as "a sign of acceptance of the witness." Even in the context of testimony, we will demonstrate a sense of courag~<br>

Abstract: Comment expliquer la « fonctionnalité » des quatre cavaliers de l'Apocalypse de Jean? Si le passage fait référence à l'une des visions nocturnes du Proto-Zacharie, les couleurs (blanc, rouge, noir) et les attributs (arc, épée, balance) renvoient très nettement à un schéma indo-européen, celui des trois fonctions duméziliennes, auxquelles certains proposent d'ajouter une quatrième, qu'incarnerait ici le dernier cheval verdâtre. Il s'agit donc très probablement d'une création de l'auteur à partir d'une donnée empruntée à l'Iran. Cet emprunt est à replacer au sein des échanges entre traditions judéo-chrétiennes et indo-européennes, processus en partie responsable du développement de l'apocalyptique. How can we explain the « functional » pattern of the four riders, in the Revelation of John? If the passage refers to one of the night visions to be found in Proto-Zechariah, the colours — white, red, black — and the attributes — bow, sword, and a set of scales — clearly relate back to an Indo-European pattern, which corresponds to the three functions defined by Dumézil, to which some would propose to add a fourth function, embodied here by the last « pale » horse. One then can very likely infer that the text might have been devised by the author out of data borrowed from Iranian sources. Such borrowings are to be replaced within the current of exchanges that fared between Jewish-Christians traditions and Indo-Europeans ones, a process that partly led to the development of apocalyptic trends.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Britt Brian<br>
Abstract: In spite of limited resources, intellectual diversity, and arguments that texts are overrated as a method and object of study, this essay argues that religion and literature maintains a vital and even subversive identity by its commitment to the text. After challenging Lawrence Sullivan's argument against the 'tyranny of the text' in religious studies, I sketch three dimensions of texts that concern religion and literature as I see it: the aesthetic, the critical, and the transcendental. With an emphasis on the subversive function of religion and literature, I apply a hermeneutic of suspicion to these dimensions of text through two metaphors: the wig (la perruque) and the veil.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>

Author(s): Hall W. David<br>
Abstract: This essay takes Paul Ricoeur's use of the phrase "economy of the gift" as an opportunity to explore the relationship between theology, ethics, and poetic redescription. A primay focus is Ricoeur's juxtaposition of the golden rule and the love command, the manner in which these two are poetically related by biblical discourse, and what this means for theological ethics. This focus offers the opportunity to explore some of the more radical implications of Ricoeur's claims about the poetic, redescriptive function of religious discourse, implications that were not adequately addressed by Ricoeur himself.<br>

Abstract: Lo studio della funzione e del significato dei nomi propri nelle opere letterarie è già da tempo al centro degli interessi della critica internazionale, ma in Italia esso si è accresciuto in maniera determinante soltanto durante gli anni '90. Si propone qui dunque una rassegna bibliografica sugli orientamenti della critica italiana intorno al tema in questione, guardando alle tendenze attuali della ricerca, ai numerosi campi di applicazione e alle prospettive future, e mostrando il contributo riginarle apportato dall'Italia agli studi di Onomastica letteraria. The study of function and meaning of proper names utilized in works of fiction has already been at the centre of international critical interests for many years, but increased considerely in Italy only during the 1990's. Thus, we provide here a bibliographical survey of the critical Italian approach to this subject, looking at the present trends of research, at several fields of application and future perspectives, and showing innovative Italian contribution to Literary Onomastics studies.<br>

Abstract: Ulanov, p 41: "For the woman, the archetype of the animus symbolizes the masculine elements
in her personality; its function is to mediate the contents of the objective psyche to her conscious
ego. The nuclear core of the animus archetype is represented by such male images as the laborer,
judge, teacher, monk, Prince Charming, prophet.... It is represented mythologically in tales
having to do with the masculine in all its forms, such as the conquering hero, the great king, or the
wise man, and is symbolized by male deities such as Zeus, Dionysus, Apollo, Pan, or the Devil".<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Introduction and Notes, Cambridge 1907, 388:,,ή δ'έρμηνεία. To express and interpret thought
is the special function of language (διάλεχτος)." Die gleiche Bedeutung hält sich auch sonst

Aristoteles Peri Poietikes, Berlin und Leipzig 1934, S. 189 mit dem Hinweis auf die hermeneia

auch dort bedeutet hermeneia immer die Mitteilung von etwas. In der ps.-aristotelischen

1428 a 10, 1435 a 21, 1435 a 4/5, 1436 a 21, 1441 b 22), in der Topik und De Sophisticis
Elenchis um die Art sich vernünftig auszudrücken oder um zweideutige Ausdrucksweise

Abstract: This article examines the relativistic view according to which the interpretation of texts is a matter of opinion and one interpretation is as good as any other. It clarifies the question by establishing precise understandings of texts and interpretations and by introducing various distinctions between different kinds of interpretations based on their function. It argues that not all kinds of interpretations are relativistic, although all interpretations are relative, and that even those interpretations that are relativistic are not so in the same ways.<br>

Abstract: The subject of the presented research is the analysis of relations between Post-Critical Belief and Sense of Coherence in women and men in early, middle, and late adulthood. Six hundred and thirty-six individuals participated in the research, 332 women and 304 men, at the age of 18–79 years. We applied the Post-Critical Belief scale by Hutsebaut (J Empir Theol 9:48–66, 1996) and the Sense of Coherence scale (SOC-29) by Antonovsky (Soc Sci Med 36:725–733, 1993). The results suggest that the salutogenic function of religiosity is related to age and gender—in women, it is most strongly marked in late, and in men, in middle adulthood<br>

Abstract: En este trabajo se propone una interpretación de la identidad de los santos tzeltales (en la región de los Altos de Chiapas, México) desde la perspectiva del concepto indígena de persona. Partiendo de la concepción que los tzeltales tienen de la persona, como un compuesto homogéneo en su vertiente exterior y heterogéneo en su vertiente interior, aquí se explora la posibilidad de que los santos tzeltales representen una inversión de este modelo. En tal caso, la imagen de los santos descubriría aquello que en los seres humanos se encuentra oculto en el interior del corazón, esto es, sus almas. Esta posibilidad se explora a través de tres campos principales : la imagen de los santos que se encuentran en el interior de la iglesia, la narrativa sobre los santos y la función de los santos en los textos terapéuticos chamánicos. Le présent travail propose une interprétation de l'identité des saints tzeltals (Chiapas, Mexique) à la lumière du concept indigène de la personne. En partant de la conception que les Tzeltals ont de la personne humaine comme un composé homogène dans son versant extérieur et hétérogène dans son versant intérieur on explore ici la possibilité que les saints représentent une inversion de ce modèle. Dans ce cas, l'image des saints exposerait ce qui, dans l'être humain, se trouve caché à l'intérieur du cœur, c'est-à-dire ses âmes. On explore cette hypothèse dans trois champs : l'image des saints à l'intérieur de l'église, les récits sur les saints et la fonction des saints dans les prières de guérison. This paper uses indigenous concepts of Personhood to redefine the identify of saints among the Tzeltal (Chiapas, Mexico). Considering the Tzeltal conceive the Self as a homogeneous compound in its outside and a heterogeneous one in its inside, the author explores the possibility that Tzeltal Saints might precisely invert this pattern. If so, the image of the saints would reveal that which — in living beings — is hidden within the heart : namely their soul~<br>

Scheler, which regards acts as "incorporeal (onlichamelijk), (pure 'psychonomic') intentional
experiences" (TM, XV).<br>

Abstract: In human beings in a vegetative condition the cerebral cortex and important parts of the
limbic system are switched off. The brainstem (and basic nuclei) however are intact. These
patients are in permanent coma, and are unconscious, although they can as a rule breathe and
swallow without mechanical help. In other words, these coma patients have an intact 'reptilian
brain', but do not function in the perceptive sense.<br>

Article Title: Can Histories be True? Narrativism, Positivism, and the "Metaphorical Turn"<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342994<br>

Abstract: Narrativism, as represented by Hayden White and Frank Ankersmit, can fruitfully be analyzed as an inversion of two brands of positivism. First, narrativist epistemology can be regarded as an inversion of empiricism. Its thesis that narratives function as metaphors which do not possess a cognitive content is built on an empiricist, "picture view" of knowledge. Moreover, all the non-cognitive aspects attributed to narrative as such are dependent on this picture theory of knowledge and a picture theory of representation. Most of the epistemological characteristics that White and Ankersmit attribute to historical narratives therefore share the problems of this picture theory. The article's second thesis is that the theories of narrative explanation can also fruitfully be analyzed as inversions of positivist covering-law theory. Ankersmit's brand of narrativism is the most radical in this respect because it posits an opposition between narrative and causal modes of comprehension while simultaneously eliminating causality from narrativist historical understanding. White's brand of narrativism is more of a hybrid than is Ankersmit's as far as its theory of explanation is concerned; nevertheless, it can also be fruitfully interpreted as an inversion of covering-law theory, replacing it by an indefinite multitude of explanatory strategies. Most of the striking characteristics of both White's and Ankersmit's narrativism presuppose positivism in these two senses, especially their claim that historical narratives have a metaphorical structure and therefore no truth-value. These claims are hard to reconcile with the factual characteristics of debates by historians; this problem can be tracked down to the absence in "metaphorical" narrativism of a conceptual connection between historical narratives and historical research.<br>

Author(s): Roberts Tyler<br>
Abstract: The last two decades have been fascinating and productive ones for theorists of religion. Recent work has offered a remarkably wide range of theoretical perspectives and possibilities that enrich our field even as they plunge us into vigorous theoretical debates. Amidst this contest-even confusion-some basic principles for guiding future work seem to be asserting themselves. Many think that, after a century of confusion and intermingling between theology and the study of religion, scholars of religion are finally in a position to establish the study of religion on properly academic, theoretical foundations. In this story Eliade's antireductionist discourse of the "sacred" becomes the epitome and, it is hoped, the last gasp of religious studies as a quasi-theological discourse. Yet despite their efforts to guide the study of religion away from Eliade, many remain Eliadan insofar as they accept Eliade's "locative" approach to religion. Yet is it really "theology" that is currently limiting the way we "imagine religion," or might it be instead the refusal to think beyond religion's locative function-a refusal very closely linked to the desire for academic respectability in a historicist age? Mark C. Taylor's After God provocatively disturbs the idea that religion is primarily locative and, in doing so, also disturbs the boundaries between the theological and the theoretical, religion and the study of religion. I consider the significance of this virtual map of religion, by reading After God with and against J. Z. Smith's early reflections or experiments with the ideas of chaos, incongruity, and location. I argue that Taylor's book leads us back to paths from which Smith turned in his early work.<br>

Author(s): Tourage Mahdi<br>
Abstract: This paper is a phenomenological study of one of Simin Behbahani's better known poems, "Raqqaseh," which is about the nightly ritualized dance of a dancing girl in a tavern. It will argue that the tavern in this poem could be viewed as a cultural container for socially dangerous representations and impulses, like the metaphoric sexualized body of the dancing girl. The tavern could also be viewed as a semiotic register for the symbolic representation of the dominant normative social discourse. By viewing the dance as performance, the communicative association of the symbolic significance of the dancing girl's body and the tavern and its audience will also be discussed. This paper will argue that the reader too is implicated in the performative function of the text.<br>

Abstract: Agamben on the function of the pronoun in medieval grammatical thought:

pronoun is that part of speech in which the passage from signifying to demonstrating is
enacted: pure being, the substantia indeterminata that it signifies and that, as such, is not in
itself signifiable or definable, becomes signifiable and determinable through an act of 'indi-
cation'" (31/22).<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>

Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un análisis de la novela Una casa vacía (1996) del escritor chileno Carlos Cerda, basado en la identificación de elementos de imaginería gótica en distintos niveles de la obra. Se estudia el funcionamiento de estos elementos dentro del macro esencialmente realista de la obra, para intentar establecer los límites cruzados entre el testimonio, la historia oficial y sus metaforizaciones. La alegoría final que la obra novelesca construye en relación con la antigua casa de tortura y sus habitantes, se corresponde con el período final de la Dictadura Militar (1973-1989) y las prácticas de tortura realizadas por organismos de gobierno contra civiles. Sin embargo, también se trata de mostrar la dificultad del realismo testimonial para escribir una novela sobre la degradación y el sufrimiento de la sociedad chilena del período, sin caer en una ideología maniquea de la narración. This article is an analysis of Una casa vacía (1996), a novel written by the Chilean author Carlos Cerda. This analysis is based upon the identification of elements of the Gothic imaginery at different levels of this narrative. The functioning of these elements is studied within the basically realistic frame of the novel, in order to establish the permeable boundaries between testimonial narrative, the official history and its metaphorizations. The ultimate allegory that the novel builds around a former torture house and its inhabitants finds its correspondence with the final period of the Military Dictatorship (1973-1989) and the torture practices carried by Government Organizations against civilians. Nevertheless, this article tries to show the difficulty of testimonial realism in order to write a novel about the suffering and decadence of the Chilean society of the period, without succumbing to a Manichean concept of the narrative function.<br>

Abstract: In Juan Manuel's fourteenth-century masterpiece El Conde Lucanor, the analogical relationship between the narrative frame and the intercalated apologues has often been mentioned. This article makes use of recent work on the way analogies function in order to better understand the much-vaunted "didacticism" of the Conde Lucanor. Investigation of the first ejemplo from the standpoint of recent theoretical work on analogies reveals that two analogies are in fact in operation, the second of which "thinks" the Conde Lucanor as a book and makes Patronio and his apologues indispensable to Count Lucanor for the duration of book 1.<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Abstract: In the context of autonomy, it is important to note the affinities between Freud and
what is known as 'positive liberty' (the type of liberty Isaiah Berlin suggested both Rousseau
and Kant adhered to). Freud believes that the self s freedom involves self-mastery, the capac-
ity of the ego to occupy the mind as much as possible. From his perspective, freedom is not
simply given once external interferences and obstacles are removed; rather, it is gained by
learning to conquer the psychic forces that spring from both the id and the super-ego, forces
that if left unchecked inhibit our capacity to function in and cope with the world. Neverthe-
less, Freud did not translate his understanding of human freedom to the political realm, and
avoided the notion that self-mastery also involves similarity among selves. On this matter,

Abstract: The conflict between President John F. Kennedy and the management of the steel industry in April, 1962 has been interpreted in an unsatisfactory manner. Many of Kennedy's reactions appear to be inexplicable and do not conform with the impression of him either as an "idealist without illusions" or the calculating cynic of recent revisionist writing. This paper is an attempt to provide another understanding of Kennedy's behaviour. We argue that Kennedy was neither hero nor villain, but a practising politician aware of the obligations and function of his profession in a liberal democratic polity. We suggest that Kennedy was aware of the sensibilities of his constituency and that he possessed a finely attuned ear to the language and discourse of American politics in the early 1960s. Consequently Kennedy realised the peril, in the steel crisis, to his political standing and thus felt compelled to embark on a dramatic and potentially dangerous course of action. We attempt to sustain this argument by closely examining the political language of the participants, relying heavily for our analysis on the writings of the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, the Italian semiologist, Umberto Eco and the Russian linguist V.N. Volosinov.<br>

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Author(s): Duque Sonia<br>
Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Publisher: Centre national de la recherche scientifique<br>
Issue: i30121944<br>
Date: 9 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Vidal Daniel<br>
Abstract: Most analyses of developments in the religious discourse in Calvinist circles of Languedoc after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) have stressed its basic continuity. The expert comparison of sermons before 1685 with subsequent homilies at the end of the 17th century proves this "continuist" hypothesis to be false. Between the two periods, not only did the speakers change but also the structure of the discourse (transitive/intransitive) was modified as well as its relation to the text of reference (compromise on the meaning/ fundamentalism) and the function of speaking itself (intersocial saturation/intracommunity fragmentation). The pacified public discourse became a private one in a zone of textual violence.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>
Date: 12 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

Article Title: Art and Agency: A Reassessment<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i357335<br>
Date: 9 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Wolff Robert<br>
Abstract: In his book, Art and agency, Alfred Gell presents a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual communication. Art is defined by the distinctive function it performs in advancing social relationships through 'the abduction of agency'. Art objects are indexes of the artist's or model's agency. This article examines Gell's use of agency, particularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. Focusing on Gell's employment of Peirce's term 'index' (out of his triad of index, icon, and symbol), I note that Peirce's approach deflects attention from signification towards the link between art works and the things to which they refer. I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and conclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not explain the distinctive ways in which art objects extend their maker's or user's agency. Gell lacked the time to make detailed revisions before publication and I acknowledge that, given more time, he might have revised some parts of the book. / Dans son livre Art and Agency, Alfred Gell présente une théorie de l'art qui ne se base ni sur l'esthétique, ni sur la communication visuelle. Il définit l'art par sa fonction distinctive dans l'établissement de relations sociales, par «l'abduction de l'intentionnalité (agency)». Les objets d'art sont des index de l'intentionnalité de l'artiste ou du modèle. Le présent article analyse l'utilisation par Gell de l'intentionnalité, notamment dans le cadre de l'art rituel qui constitue un axe central de son raisonnement. En se concentrant sur l'usage par Gell du terme «index» de Peirce (dans la trichotomie index, icône, symbole), l'auteur note que l'approche de Peirce prête moins d'attention à la signification qu'au lien entre les œuvres d'art et les objets auxquels elles font référence. Il examine ce que Peirce entendait par «abduction» et en conclut que si Gell s'en tire bien sur l'intentionnalité des objets d'art, il n'explique pas de quelle m~<br>

Abstract: Sociology of religion and more specifically of ideologies is governed by the opposition between a certain tradition which considers religion as an instrument of communication and learning, i.e. as a structured and structuring system, and another tradition which emphasizes the political function of religious ideology. In fact, it is through its logical function of prescribing its structure to the mind, that religion fulfils the political function of maintaining the eternity of structures, i.e. the absolute of the relative and the legitimacy of the arbitrary and thus the domestication of the dominated. /// Se halla dominada la sociología de la religión (y más generalmente la de las ideologiás) por la oposición entre la tradición que trata la religión como instrumento de communicación y de conocimiento, es decir como sistema estructurado y estructurante, y la tradición que insiste en las funciones políticas de la ideología religiosa. En realidad, es precisamente porque cumple una función lógica, imponiendo sus estructuras al pensamiento, que la religión desempeña el papel político de eternización de las estructuras, es decir de absolutización del relativo y de legitimación del arbitrario y, con eso, de domesticación de los dominados. /// Die Soziologie der Religion und - allgemein gesehen die Soziologie der Ideologien - wird beherrscht vom Gegensatz einerseits zwischen der Tradition, die die Religion als ein Kommunikations- und Wissensinstrument ansieht - das heisst, als ein strukturiertes und strukturierendes System - und anderseits der Tradition, die die politischen Funktionen der religiösen Ideologie unterstreicht. In Wirklichkeit erfüllt die Religion nur insofern eine politische Funktion der Verewigung der Strukturen - das heisst die Absolutisierung des Relativen und die Legitimation des Willkürlichen und dadurch die Zähmung der Beherrschten - als sie eine logische Funktion erfüllt, indem sie dem Denken ihre Strukturen auferlegt. /// Социология религии (и вообще вс~<br>

Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a reconsideration of how similes and metaphors function in the literary reading process, and examines the effects of their respective logical and syntactic forms, their truth-functional status, their pragmatic force, their creative power in language, and their roles as part of a cumulative textual process. Through a close reading of Alfred Jarry's "Les Jours et les nuits," it tests aspects of the accounts of metaphor offered by Cooper, Davidson, Kittay, Lecercle, Le Guern, and Ricœur, and thereby questions our criteria for the classification of simile and metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Abstract: The concept of memory had great impact on cultural history during the last two decades. However, due to the influence of theorists such as Maurice Halbwachs and Pierre Nora, it is often used in a very limited way only: either as a denomination for collective interpretations of the past or as a synonym for historical myths. Individual memory is often construed as a mere function of such collective patterns of historical perception. Several studies using the method of oral history, though, have demonstrated the tensions and the discrepancies that can exist between individual memory and hegemonic discourses of remembrance. In this paper, I will argue that the use of the oral history methodology bears a considerable social historical potential for the history of recollection and)<br>

Abstract: This paper examines a Special Issue of Educational Studies in Mathematics comprising research reports centred on Peircian semiotics in mathematics education, written by some of the major authors in the area. The paper is targeted at inspecting how subjectivity is understood, or implied, in those reports. It seeks to delineate how the conceptions of subjectivity suggested are defined as a result of their being a function of the domain within which the authors reflexively situate themselves. The paper first considers how such understandings shape concepts of mathematics, students and teachers. It then explores how the research domain is understood by the authors as suggested through their implied positioning in relation to teachers, teacher educators, researchers and other potential readers.<br>

Abstract: La literatura contemporánea asume una función que, en esencia, tiene un fundamento de índole religiosa: revela sentidos en el mundo, creando vínculos entre el receptor y su propia realidad. Esta función la lleva a cabo por medio de mecanismos del lenguaje metafórico, en procesos de desmitologización y mitificación discursivas. La literatura hispanoamericana relaciona esta función del lenguaje estético con el tema de la identidad cultural. La poética del dramaturgo mexicano Rodolfo Usigli expresa esta concepción del arte de modo ejemplar. Sobre la base de los conceptos anteriores, se analizará e interpretará la elaboración de imágenes metefóricas de la identidad hispanoamericana en las obras Corona de luz, de Rodolfo Usigli; Todos los gatos son pardos, de Carlos Fuentes; y Lautaro, de Isidora Aguirre. /// Contemporary literature has assumed a function which in essence, possesses a religious grounding: it releases meaning by creating links betiveen the received and his/her ozvn reality. This function is carried out by mechanism of metaphorical language in processes of discursive demythologizing as xuell as myth making. Spanish American literary unitingrelates this function of aesthetic language to the major theme of cultural identity. The poetics of the Mexican dramatist Rodolfo Usigli expresses this conception of art in an exemplary way. On the basis of the above concepts, this article analyzes and interprets the elaboration of metaphorical images in R. Usigli's "Corona de luz", Carlos Fuentes's "Todos los gatos son pardos" and Isidora Aguirre's "Lautaro".<br>

Abstract: It is argued that to understand the Manus' construction of their environment their view of the night sky has to be taken into account. In Manus thought, celestial bodies and constellations were believed to reside at the edge of a saucer-shaped world, being able to permeate sea and sky and interact with the peoples' immediate environment. While only a small number of constellations had been named, these were sufficient to function as a calendar, a visualization of the seasonal cycle and a metaphorical explanation of the seasons. As such, they made the Manus world autonomous in the sense that the causes supposed to bring about seasonal change were situated within this world or at its edge.<br>

Publisher: ESKA Editions<br>

Author(s): Joos Maxime<br>
Abstract: Le concept d' « œuvre ouverte » , tel qu'Umberto Eco décrit, doit son existence aux collaborations avec Luciano Berio, notamment dans le cadre de la gestation d'Opera à partir de 1956. L'ouverture, dans Opera, tient notamment à la multiplicité de signification et à la complexité des références internes et externes, à « l'intégration de différents niveaux de perception » . Passaggio, créé en 1963, réalise le principe brechtien de l'abolition de la limite entre scène et public ; c'est une « action musicale », où le spectateur est pris à partie. Mais parce qu'il se libère de toute cohérence narrative, l'espace musical et dramaturgique élaboré par Berio semble ne dévoiler qu'une ouverture introspective, comme pour mieux rendre à l'écoute sa fonction primordiale. The concept of "open work", as described by Umberto Eco, owes its existence to collaborations with Luciano Berio, among others during the conception of Opera, from 1956. The openness, in Opera, consists among others in the multiplicity of meanings and in the complexity of internal and external references, in the "integration of numerous levels of perception". Passaggio, premiered in 1963, realises the Brechtian principle of the abolition of the border between scene and audience. It is a "musical action" in which the auditor has a share. However, freeing itself from any narrative coherence, the musical and dramatic space elaborated by Berio appears to unveil but an introspective openness, as if to restore hearing's primordial function.<br>

Author(s): Klein Michael L.<br>
Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: Ever since Plato the identity of philosophy has been at issue in the quarrel between philosophy and poetry. Can changing times alter the identity of philosophy, and simultaneously the identity of poetry? In the Republic poetry is a third rate illusion compared with contemplation of "the things that truly are". We can trace the background of this disqualification when we distinguish three levels in the relation of language to reality. 1. We can distinguish assertion, melody and rhythm. The first is the same in poetry and prose, the last is superfluous. 2. Speech is superior to writing in virtue of the speaker's inner mastery over himself. 3. The interiorizing move culminates in the soundless conversation of the soul with itself, contemplating the eternal identical "without the stain of speech or sign" (Boutens). For Plato, then, we move from poetry to prose, from prose to speech, from speech to silence. Is there room for aesthetics in this view? In the second part of my lecture I reconstruct Symbolism, a current in literature that in every respect is the opposite of Platonism. Although the goal is the same — the search for true reality — the difference is that the route is now reversed. I restrict myself to the French branch. 4. Baudelaire formulated the basic principle of Symbolism: the ineffable does not exist. "The ultimate goal of the universe is to be expressed" (Valéry). The same worldview is expressed later by Gadamer: an ontology "guided by language". 5. The second principle is that the primary language is script, "Book" (Mallarmé). 6. Poetry proves to be the true language. The music (rhyme, rhytm, tune) reveals the things "exactly as they are" (Wallace Stevens). In poetry the linguistic sign becomes a symbol because the sound, the physical aspect of the linguistic sign, plays a role in the production of meaning. A poem is a "sustained hesitation between sense and sound" (Valéry). Is sound not however a disturbing factor in revealing the things 'as they are'?~<br>

Abstract: En réaction au libéralisme rawlsien pour qui le droit est référé à la liberté d'action des individus, le mouvement communautarien a voulu référer le droit à l'identité culturelle (individuelle ou collective), lui assignant, ultimement, la fonction de stabiliser cette identité. Pour ces auteurs, le lien entre identité et droit est interne, ce qui ouvre la voie à ce qu'on a appelé « les paradoxes de l'identité démocratique » et conduit à la notion problématique de droits collectifs. On montrera ici comment une telle notion repose sur une « réduction identitaire » , par principe opérée au point de vue objectivant de la troisième personne, privant par là même les acteurs sociaux de leur capacité d'autodétermination, À cette vision anti-libérale dans son fondement, qui fait de la sécurité identitaire son horizon, on opposera la vision d'une identité risquée qui ne préjuge pas dogmatiquement des constituants identitaires de chacun et ouvre ainsi la voie aux authentiques principes de la coexistence multiculturelle. In reaction to Rawlsian liberalism, which relates law to freedom of action, the Communitarian movement wants to relate law to cultural identity (individual or collective), assigning it, ultimately, the function to stabilize this identity. For Communitarianism the relationship between identity and law is internal, which opens the path to what has been called « the paradoxes of democratic identity » , and leads to the problematic notion of « collective rights » . It is shown here how such a notion rests on an « identity-reduction » , which by principle is operated from a third-person perspective, depriving individuals of their capacity of self-determination. In opposition to this fundamentally anti-liberal vision, the notion of an open identity is proposed, which doesn't dogmatically predetermine the identities of everyone and opens therefore the path to the basic principles of a multicultural coexistence.<br>

Author(s): Lenclud Gérard<br>
Abstract: Les auteurs rappellent quelques-unes des difficultés soulevées par la notion de blasphème, ballotté entre un fonctionnement de régime juridique et comminatoire dans la tradition chrétienne et une acception de sens commun liée au précédent. Les remarques qu'ils posent n'entendent pas porter directement sur le « blasphème » (ce qu'il faudrait entendre, savoir ou penser sous ce terme), mais plutôt sur les moyens d'en parler, sur les opérations conceptuelles mises en oeuvre pour qui se propose de l'aborder du point de vue des sciences humaines et sociales. The authors underline some of the difficulties raised by blasphemy, a notion hesitating between its function in a judicial and comminatory sense, in the Christian tradition, and a common sense acceptation, linked to this. The author's remarks do not bear directly on « blasphemy » , on what is to be understood by the term, what we can know or think about it, but rather on the ways of talking about it, on the conceptual operations to be implemented by those who propose to deal with blasphemy from the point of view of the human and social sciences.<br>

Abstract: Pour perpétuer des éléments fondateurs de la culture, les communautés des diasporas utilisent leur espace privé comme territoire privilégié de la conservation et de l'expression d'une identité exilée. L'exemple des Arméniens du Québec est, à cet égard, particuliérement révélateur tant dans la composition de sa culture matérielle et immatérielle que dans les pratiques qui la mettent en scène par l'entremise de petits musées domestiques. À partir d'un recueil de récits de vie et de biographies d'objets, l'article propose d'établir le portrait de ces structures muséales et de leurs collections à l'échelle familiale pour ensuite saisir leur oeuvre dans le projet de transmission culturelle. Living in a Diaspora commands an increased vigilance for the perpetuation of the founding elements of a culture. In this perspective, in a host country, the private sphere and its heritage constitute a privileged space for the preservation and expression of the exiled identity. This can be seen in domestic museums, such as those of Quebec's Armenian community, where the composition of material and immaterial culture and the presentation of its contents are particularly revealing. From a collection of life narratives and object biographies, this article proposes to draw a portrait of these family-scale museum structures and their collections to understand how they function in the project of cultural transmission. Um elementare Bestandteile ihrer Kultur zu erhalten, nutzen kulturelle Gemeinschaften in der Diaspora gerne den privaten Raum als Statte des Ausdrucks ihrer Exilidentität. Die Gemeinschaft der in Quebec lebenden Armenier ist hierfür ein sehr gutes Beispiel, sowohl was ihre materielle und immaterielle Kultur angeht als auch im Hinblick auf die Art und Weise wie sie ihre Kultur in kleinen hauslichen Museen inszenieren. An Hand von menschlichen wie auch gegenständlichen Biographien porträtiert die Autorin in diesem Artikel die musealen Strukturen und Familiensammlungen, um das en~<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une définition de l'éducation comme « relation dissymétrique, nécessaire et provisoire, visant à l'émergence d'un sujet », la pédagogie est proposée comme effort pour penser cette activité dans des situations données. Refusant une posture philosophique qui décrète l'existence du sujet pour le faire advenir, comme une attitude inspirée des sciences humaines qui abolit le sujet en réduisant ses actes à la résultante des forces qui s'exercent sur lui, la pédagogie peut se définir comme « anticipation contextualisée ». Dans cette perspective, elle requiert un discours qui exprime la singularité des sujets en situation et la mette en perspective d'universalité. Le récit peut avoir cette fonction et « faire théorie » sans, pour autant, s'abstraire des situations particulières qu'il décrit. La pédagogie comme « récits d'éducation » a alors pour fonction de favoriser la prise de décision éducative. Education being defined as "a dissymetric, necessary and temporary relation focusing on the emergence of a subject", pedagogy is considered as an endeavour to think this activity in given situations. If we refuse a philosophical position which decides the existence of a subject to make it turn into a reality - as an attitude inspired by human sciences which reduces the subject's acts to the resultant of forces exerced on him - pedagogy may be defined as a "contextualized anticipation". In this perspective, we must display the uniqueness of subjects in a specific situation and set it in a universal perspective. Narratives may have this function without neglecting the specificity of situations. Pedagogy as "narratives on education" is able to facilitate educational decision making.<br>

Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press<br>
Issue: i40071687<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Venegas José Luis<br>
Abstract: This article analyzes the function of letter writing and epistolary correspondence in Gustavo Sainz's fiction, particularly Obsesivos días circulares (1969) and A la salud de la serpiente (1991). It contends that the personal letter emerges in these novels as a form of expression and communication that breaks with the models of individual and collective identity fostered and consolidated by the Mexican state during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In addition, epistolary writing responds to the political situation in post-Tlatelolco Mexico by contesting the temporal homogeneity needed to imagine the nation as a unitary social body progressing toward modernity. Epistolary writing thus opens the narrative text to competing, unresolved temporalities while at the same time unmooring individual subjectivity from the destinies of a repressive nation-state.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Abstract: This paper reviews a body of data that identifies underlying influences that have contributed to an evolving change in American Psychiatry toward a more positive and receptive stance toward religion and spirituality over the past three decades. This development, surprising in light of the remedicalization of psychiatry and its predominantly neuro-biological orientation, is attributed to five foundational ideas that have helped to leverage this change. These are significance of culture, creative power of ritual, psychic function of belief, neuro-biology of spirituality, and relevance of recovery narratives. The impact of these factors for psychiatric assessment and treatment is described, as well as the contribution of the Oskar Pfister legacy and award to the ongoing dialogue between religion and psychiatry. Adapted from the American Psychiatric Association's 2011 Oskar Pfister Lecture in Religion and Psychiatry.<br>

Abstract: As a consequence of the systematic use of the French « passé composé » , the style of Albert Camus's best-known novel deviates from the traditional French novel. But it is indeed the basic function of tenses and time adverbs which is deconstructed : actions and events can no longer be located relatively to the time of utterance. The stylistic innovation of the novel cannot be separated from the enunciative choices. The article examines how Albert Camus goes from « La Mort heureuse » (a novel written in the third-person and the French « passé simple » which he never published) to a novel which is a landmark in French fiction. The stylistic choices are studied through a comparison of the opening pages of the two novels and in a fragment of « La Mort heureuse » which Camus takes up again almost literally in « L'Etranger ».<br>

Abstract: John Blacking's suggestion that some music transcends its social function by creating worlds of virtual time opens the way to a deeper understanding of the ontology of music. For Blacking, "music that is for being" enhances human consciousness by heightening temporal experiences. Music's power to affect our consciousness of time stands at the heart of an ontology of music. By examining music s relation to limit experiences such as trance and ecstasy, in which time itself appears to be transcended, I intend to argue that music's mode of being is the ground of its social, cultural, and even spiritual efficacy.<br>

Abstract: No encadeamento de oito temas analisam-se tensões e aporias (no sentido mais platónico que aristotélico) inerentes à compreensão filosófica da obra de arte. (1) Quem compreende melhor a essência da arte, o filósofo ou o artista? Noutros termos, qual o papel da razão na compreensão da arte? (2) A arte permanece na procura do belo ou rege-se hoje apenas pela busca de expressão do artista? (3) Mas então será o artista um ser de exceção? (4) Por sua vez, esta questão leva à distinção entre a forma e o conteúdo da obra de arte. (5) O "conteúdo" da obra remete para o problema da "finalidade" da obra. (6) Na linha da finalidade surge a função central da arte, isto é, a fruição pela "trans-figuração" do mundo. Na esteira desta função abrem-se tres problemas, brevemente evocados: (7) a dimensão social e política da arte; (8) os êxitos facéis e os fracassos da arte, assim como (9) o eventual esgotamento da arte na atitude estética. In lacing together eight themes, the article analyzes tensions and aporias (more in the Platonic sense than the Aristotelian) inherent in the philosophical understanding of a work of art. (1) Who best understands the essence of art, the philosopher or the artist? Otherwise said, what is the role of reason in the understanding of art? (2) Does art reside in the search of the beautiful, or does it orient itself today by the artists expression? (3) What makes an artist an exceptional human being? (4) This leads us to the distinction between form and content in a work of art. (5) The "content" of a work refers to its finality. (6) In the line of finality, the central function of art appears, i.e., the fruition through the "trans-figuration" of the world. In the wake of this function, three problems are briefly presented: (7) the social and political dimension of art; (8) the easy successes and failures of art, as well as (9) the eventual emptying of art in aesthetic attitude.<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: The study ’The meaning of action, the action of meaning’ raises the theoretical question of the relationship between the intent and meaning, the self-referentiality and referentiality of the literary text. It sets out from the hypothesis that a literary text has not only a self-referential, but also a referential character. Unlike non-literary texts whose function is their intent, the referentiality of a literary text is open. The ambiguity and polysemy of the text then results from the non-obviousness of reality itself. The concept that captures this difference between literary texts and texts with other functions is that of meaning. The study uses the concrete example of the thematicisation of the metamorphosis of a puppet, a monster or an animal into a man in Kleist, Collodi and Grass to illustrate the difference between mechanical intent founded upon efficiency and living meaning, founded on ambiguity and non-functional complexity. An analysis of Pavel Vilikovský’s novel Kôn na poschodí, slepec vo Vrábroch (’Horse Upstairs, Blind Man in Vráble’) shows how, in its thematic, ostentatiously self-referential action, meaning is born as an expression of the polysemic re fe re n tia lity of the text. The analy sis shows that behind this self-referentiality the text is also created in the referential action of meaning to such an extent that it is precisely the open action of meaning which becomes the r » on-obvious sense of the action of the text.<br>

Abstract: The article traces distinet approaches to the concepts of 'meaning', 'reference' and 'sense' in twentieth-century literary theory and general semioties. It offers an account of different concepts of 'mimesis', 'reference', and 'representation' from the point of view of fictional world making as well as from the point of reading a narrative. The article focuses on the tension between mimesis and diegesis, as coined by Plato and Aristotle, and it interprets concepts developed in recent times by scholars such as Jakobson, Quine, Ricoeur, Eco and de Man. Distinet sections of the article focus on the following: the referential function of proper names and the two contrasting approaches of Kripke and Linsky; the contrast between mimesis and diegesis as a functional reference to the world of experience in Ricoeur; the correspondence and truth conditions in Strawson and Davidson; the emphasis on coherence as a way of eliminating mimesis and reference in Eco’s semiotics; the radical elimination of both the reference and the signified in deconstruction; the issue of textual re-presentation. The article attempts to illustrate the thesis that by accepting intentional, inside-of-the-text produced concepts of meaning the reader and the critic would eventually loos not only ali the ties to the actual world but also the impulses for reading and interpreting.<br>

Abstract: The article is concerned with the foundation of figurative sense (FS) by metaphorization, as well as on the operation of FS. The author emphasizes the directive function of domains, which substitutes metaphorical seeing for „seeing" and determines an aspect proper to FS. The essential component of FS is not grasping, but is the aesthetic experience of the distance between ordinary vision and the new vision. Distance is surmounted by a stream of images that implement FS. By displaying this stream, FS merges with daydreaming, but much more with the play of accidental connections. In addition to metaphorization, FS is sometimes based on placing statements out of logical space. The author argues against a unilateral interpretation of correlations between the metaphorical statement and its context. He provides examples to demonstrate the diversification of this correlation and its impact on the foundation of FS.<br>

Abstract: In the twentieth century the phenomenon of the subjective body was integrated into ontology in philosophy, moving from Phenomenology to Existentialism. The rediscovery of the body and affect as a way of thinking also led contemporary cognitive science to the topic of the relationship between emotion and cognition, to the necessity of expanding the model of the mind and of experiencing emotions and physical sensation. The extension of the explanatory possibilities of a scholarly metalanguage into the area of the emotions and physical sensation is also important for the analysis of the acoustic aspect of lyric verse. In the acoustic flow of verse, the sounds of language have, apart from a phonemic function, their own sensuous (emotional) effect of the articulating body. In literary studies so far the acoustic flow has been interpreted only at the segmental level as a sequence of phonemes or sounds (for example in constructs of acoustic succession, phonetic instrumentation, or phonetic composition). At the suprasegmental level the acoustic flow must be conceived of as a sequence of syllables, a sequence of articulated phonations, the semantic movement of the phonemic flow. A syllable has no semantic value, but does have an experiential form, which influences motivation, behaviour, and experience. In addition to sonic and tonal modulation at the suprasegmental level, qualitative modulation, modulation of timbre, and the sequences of tones and of noise are also employed. In modelling the semantic movement of syllables in a phonemic flow the methodological approaches of experimental psychosemantics have been used. Connotational objectivization took place in three dimensions that were polarized on the basis of domestic and alien, light and darkness, activity and passivity, and research was conducted with a sample of 2,800 respondents. The analysis of the acoustic side of lyric verse would be incomplete if in addition to accentual rhythm and melody we did not also consider ~<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Publisher: University of Arkansas<br>

Author(s): Keller Joseph<br>
Abstract: A verbal message is a work of art because of the poetic function of language which we recognize because it appears in conversation. We understand one another through a mutual verbal accommodation. The resultant redundancy is precisely the poetic function. Analogously, when we encounter a poem with its multiple parallelism, we alter its language as well as our own, creating "community" just as we do in the most meaningful talk. A brief excursus into a variety of medieval poetry illustrates a relevance to criticism. Because the proverbs which abound in social complaint encapsulate community consensus, they reinforce poetic strategy.<br>

Abstract: Metaphorics, the movement and process of metaphor, is distributed in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as modes generating meaning in each of the novel's five chapters. Each of these modes is linked with the specific "historical" matrix in which it originates, a site which determines the metaphor's structure, its function, and the stylistic effects it produces.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte a pour objet de montrer que le moment de la « refiguration » dans Temps et récit est indissociable d'un souci éthique. La fonction narrative a des implications éthiques car le récit — et particulièrement le récit d'une (ou des) vie(s) — constitue un point de passage: il pose la question de la communicabilité ou de l'échange des expériences. D'où la difficulté que Ricœur a lui-même affrontée: qu'en est-il des vies qui ne trouvent pas de narrateur? My aim is to bring to light how « refiguration » — as analysed in Time and Narrative — is strongly linked to an ethical care. Narrative function has ethical consequences because Narrative of a life (or of several Ufes) is a way to communicability and exchange of experiences. That is the raison why Ricœur himself confronted the difficulty: what about Ufes deprived of Narrative?<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The effect of a metaphor is based on a shift in expectancy and cannot be established in advance. Various proposals on the meaning of παιδαγωγός are considered in the light of Paul's argumentative strategy in Galatians 3. In the light of this strategy it is evident that Paul uses this metaphor to indicate the temporary and captive nature of the situation under the law. As a persuasive strategy this metaphor provides the reader with an unexpected view on the function of the law, as well as their own position, urging them to return to 'his' gospel.<br>

Abstract: By exploring different aspects of an 'ethical' reading of a New Testament document, this paper is concerned with the challenge of an integrated, relevant approach towards understanding the letter to the Ephesians—an approach which would account for its nature as ancient canonised text, as well as the needs of contemporary readers. By way of illustration, the identity and roles of different groups of people referred to in the text are re-examined in terms of the rhetorical function of the letter as a whole.<br>

Abstract: This contribution is an attempt to continue a dialogue on the issue of reference in biblical text which has its origin in an interchange with Willem Vorster and which is partly documented in the publication Text and reality. In the first section, the continuing relevance of reference is illustrated by a discussion of a number of contemporary Afrikaans historical novels, where the relationship between (historical) narrative and (historical) 'reality' is treated in a very innovative way. In a second section the dynamic nature of reference is discussed in the light of three aspects developed by Ricoeur, namely reference as self-transcendence, as redescription and as an integrative process. In a final section, the inevitable return to reality is explained. It is argued that a better understanding of the function of reference in all its facets holds the key to unlock the transformative potential of these texts in contemporary situations.<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Author(s): Franzen Aaron B.<br>
Abstract: The Bible is an important text in American history, but research analyzing the social consequences of reading the Bible is very limited. Research focusing on religious practices or religiosity with Bible reading as part of a scale shows a tendency towards conservatism and traditionalism, as do more literalist views of the Bible. In the present study, biblical literalism is treated as a powerful context guiding one's reading. The focus here is a quantitative view of Bible reading, deploying two 'conservative' and two 'liberal' moral/political scales and two competing views for how Bible reading may function. Results indicate that Bible reading is positively related to both of the liberal scales as well as the conservative scales for non-literalists, but not for those with literalist Bible views. The findings begin to show the importance of independent Bible reading, how it may function differently for literalists and non-literalists, and highlights the degree to which literalism and Bible reading are different constructs.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing Ltd<br>
Issue: i40128072<br>
Date: 5 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Mills Mary<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the profiles of the women characters Sarah and Hagar as models of human identity. The two characters can only be explored through reading the over-arching narrative of the story of Abraham. Their profiles and narrated personalities have to be extracted from that narrative, but there is a two-sided nature of this necessity. If Sarah and Hagar cannot be separated from the biblical narrator's engagement with father Abraham, neither can Abraham function as father of the nations except through his interaction with these two women. The reader is thus led towards an understanding of how the stories of Genesis 12-24 deal with the issue of parenthood. The body of the paper consists in a close reading of the biblical material following a method of reading which is rooted in the use of imagination as an exegetical tool - a style adopted by Paul in his allegorical approach to Sarah and Hagar in Galatians 4. This approach opens into narrative criticism with a focus on characterisation and on the interactions of Sarah, Hagar and Abraham, caught up in a Domestic Comedy. The women's characters are explored through the themes of parenthood as other, the other woman and woman as other. A final section explores some of the points of narrative ethics to be extracted from the close textual readings of the paper, with reference to the writings of Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas. It is suggested that female as well as male characters may offer fruitful models for human identity.<br>

Этот текст чрезвычайно интересен, потому что, будучи одновременно и воспоминанием и рассказом, он принадлежит одновременно к сфере автобиографии и к сфере художественного вымысла. Поэтому в нем сходятся человек и писатель. Французский текст ближе к ностальгическому воссозданию потерянного мира, чем английский, как будто эмоции, связанные с определенным языком, невозможно передать в другом. В английском варианте самые интимные впечатления сглажены, как будто повествователь и герой — разные лица. В нем более отстраненно повествуется о волнующем мире первой Майетоізеііе 0> опубликованной в Мезигез. Французский вариант более неуклюже- трогательний, а английский более сжатый и музыкально-уравновешенный. Во втором варианте самоутверждается англоязычный писатель, тогда как автор первого варианта явно не ставил перед собой подобной цели. This article aims at demonstrating that the ancillary function of translation cannot be valid with personal experience and moving memories at stake. When Nabokov resorts to selftranslation he aims at ascertaining his identity as a writer in the language into which he translates. The case of Mademoiselle O is slightly different and exceptionally interesting because this text is both a memoir and a story, it pertains both to the world of autobiography and to that of fiction. Hence, the meeting of man and writer. The French text is more of a nostalgic reconstruction of a lost world and life than the English one, as if the emotions linked to one specific tongue could not be delivered in another. The most intimate sensations are erased in the English version as if narrator and actor were two distinct persons. The English is more an imp~<br>

Author(s): PAYEN Pascal<br>
Abstract: A l'intérieur du corpus des Vies parallèles de Plutarque, la Vie de Sertorius offretrois singularités : elle est la seule qui se déroule presque en totalité en Occident ; elle appartient au seul couple - Sertorius-Eumène — où le Romain est placé en premier ; le récit ne couvre pas la durée d'une vie, mais isole dix années (83/2 à 73 av. J.-C). Comment rendre compte ensemble de ces trois données situées sur des plans différents ? Les Vies parallèles délimitent un espace qui, à la fin du Ier siècle et au début du IIe, correspond au monde dominé par Rome, devenue garante et protectrice d'une histoire commune. Or autant l'Orient a reçu l'empreinte dts Grecs et des Romains, autant l'Occident est resté à l'écart. Ainsi formulera-t-on l'hypothèse que le sujet principal de cette Vie, tout autant que le personnage même de Sertorius, est l'Espagne, ou plus exactement l'extrême Occident, qui fait écho à l'extrême Orient, aussi bien à l'intérieur du récit (avec l'épisode de la troisième guerre de Mithridate) qu'au sein de l'ensemble des Vies. L'objet de cette étude est donc d'étudier en quoi une source grecque, postérieure de deux siècles aux événements qu'elle rapporte, témoigne de la place et de la fonction de l'extrême Occident dans la Méditerranée gréco-romaine, et, en cela, de mettre au jour quelques-unes des contraintes que pose, en tant que source, la Vie de Sertorius pour l'étude de l'Hispanie de la fin de la République. Within the corpus of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, the Life of Sertorius presents three peculiarities: it is the only one to take place almost entirely in the West; it belongs to the only couple -Sertorius-Eumenes- in which the Roman is given precedence; the narrative does not cover a whole lifetime but isolates ten years (83/2 to 73 BC). How then take together and account for those three facts situated at different levels ? The Parallel Lives delimits a space which, by the end of the 1st century and the beginning of the second, corresponds to a world unde~<br>

Abstract: La 'démonstration' présentée dans Rhet. Her. 4,68 est le point de départ pour une étude qui vise à souligner comme traits qui lui sont propres la complémentarité de ενάργεια et de ενέργεια. À ce propos on prend en considération l'une après l'autre ces deux notions et les textes des auteurs anciens où l'on peut mieux comprendre leur nature et leur fonction à l'intérieur d'un discours. Après avoir mentionné les définitions de Γένάργεια données par l'Anonyme de Seguière et par Denys d'Halicarnasse et après avoir souligné la différence entre ενάργεια et σαφήνεια on s'attache à examiner quelles sont les conditions qui permettent au locuteur de 'mettre sous les yeux' des auditeurs ce qu'il dit. À l'importance des détails mentionnée par les différents auteurs s'ajoute en fait l'effet suggestif de ce que les Grecs appelaient φαντασίαι et les Latins visiones. On se penche donc sur les textes de Quintilien et de l'auteur du Sublime qui en traitent longuement et on met en relief le rôle joué à ce propos par Γένέργεία des faits, c'est-à-dire par leur façon d'être 'en acte'. Une fois cette notion éclaircie à l'aide de la Métaphysique et de la Rhétorique d'Aristote on conclut cette brève recherche par la mention du niveau le plus haut que l'évidence rhétorique peut atteindre : l'effet émotionnel du couple ενέργεια - ενάργεια qui pousse les auditeurs à se voir, eux-mêmes, sur la scène. The "demonstration" presented in Rhet. Her. 4,68, is the starting point of a study which aims at underscoring as specific features of the demonstration the complementarity of enargeia and energeia. In order to suit our purpose, we have examined one after the other those two notions and the texts of ancient writers in which we can better apprehend their nature and function within a discourse. After mentioning the definitions of enargeia given by the Anonym of Seguière and Denys of Helicarnassus, and after having underscored the difference between enargeia and energeia. we go on to examine the conditi~<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: A partir de una visión de la moneda que toma en cuenta su función simbólica primera —la de la representación de la totalidad social—, este artículo analiza la relación entre legitimidad política y el régimen monetario, puesta en escena por el paso de las altas inflaciones a la deflación en América Latina. En esta perspectiva se reconsideran los problemas de sustentabilidad de las políticas monetarias, y se establece que las mismas plantean más en América Latina que en Europa, el problema de la relación entre las soberanías política y monetaria. La interrogación se remite así al futuro posible del Mercosur: ¿se enredará en la discusión comercial o será motivo de emprender una deliberación política sobre la reorganización territorial y el marco institucional que sostendrían un crecimiento en economía abierta impulsado por el empleo y la demanda? On the basis of a view of currency that considers its initial symbolic function— that of the representation of social totality— the text analyzes the relationship between political legitimacy and monetary regime, caused by the shift from high inflation to deflation in Latin America. The problems of the sustainability of monetary policies are considered from this point of view, and the author suggests that, even more so in Latin America than in Europe, these policies raise the problem of the relationship between political and monetary sovereignty. The question leads one to the possible future of Mercosur: will it become enmeshed in trade discussions or will it lead to a political discussion on territorial reorganization and the institutional framework that would support growth in an open economy driven by employment and demand? À partir d'une vision de la monnaie qui prend en compte sa fonction symbolique première celle de la représentation de la totalité sociale, on analyse dans ce texte la relation entre légitimité politique et régime monétaire, relation mise en scène par le passage, en Amérique latine, de l'inflation galopan~<br>

Author(s): TodorovAbstract: Rapidement, derrière la réclamation de la réparation morale des crimes contre l'humanité que constituent la traite négrière et l'esclavage dans les colonies françaises durant deux siècles, pointent des revendications de réparations matérielles de ces crimes. À l'inverse de ladite réparation, ces revendications paraissent n'avoir que très peu de possibilité d'être effectivement satisfaites et ne présenter qu'une faible légitimité à l'être. Et ce, principalement, parmi d'autres facteurs, du fait de l'éloignement dans le temps des crimes en question. C'est que s'il est vrai que bien des inégalités que connaissent les peuples des départements français d'Outre-mer portent encore la marque de l'oppression esclavagiste passée, il n'est pas moins certain qu'elles ne sont pas à combattre en fonction du passé, mais relativement a des dominations présentes. /// Quite soon, following in the tracks of a demand for a moral reparation of two centuries of slavery and slave trade in France's colonies, claims have been made for material reparations of these crimes against humanity. Unlike the first demand, these claims have very few chances of actually being satisfied and are apparently lacking in justification, mainly because, among others factors, these crimes lie in a distant past. Although many of the inequalities experienced by the inhabitants of the French overseas departments still bear the marks of slavery, it is no less true that the struggle against inequality is not to be led as a function of the past but, instead, in relation to present-day domination.<br>

Author(s): Hoskins Gareth<br>
Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Author(s): Greisch Jean<br>
Abstract: La question de la métaphore se pose à trois niveaux: celui de l'analyse sémantique (philosophie analytique du langage), celui de sa fonction herméneutique (Paul Ricœur), enfin la question proprement « ontologique » de sa portée pour l'ensemble du discours philosophique comme tel. L'étude présente est une contribution à cette dernière problématique, envisagée à partir du discours de Martin Heidegger. L'étude se fait en trois étapes : liquidation de la représentation métaphysique de la métaphore; la métaphore dans le discours philosophique de Heidegger; retour d'une nouvelle problématique de la métaphore, autour du couple métaphore morte/métaphore vivante. The question of metaphor in philosophy may be asked in three different ways: analysis of its function (anglo-saxon philosophy of language); link with the problem of interpretation (hermeneutics); finally the « ontological » question of its meaning for philosophical discourse as such. The present study is a contribution to the latter question, focused on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The question is developped in threee steps: elimination of the metaphysical conception of metaphor; the metaphor inside the philosophical discourse of Heidegger; come-back of a new conception of metaphor, which has not yet been completely shaped out, but which must be related to the opposition of dead and living metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Le silence des théologiens sur ce qui, jadis, fit partie de leur discipline suscite une question: pourquoi les anges se sont-ils tus? Comment pourraient-ils à nouveau parler? L'article tente de répondre à la question en rappelant d'abord ce que pourrait suggérer au mathématicien l'antique doctrine des « substances séparées ». Mais, et surtout, au-delà de la « substance », au-delà même des « missions » que la Bible lui assigne, l'ange semble bénéficier d'une dimension « poétique ». L'auteur tente une élucidation de cette fonction poétique, en liaison avec ce qu'il appelle la fonction « Méta ». The silence of theologians on what was formerly a part of their scholarly discipline raises a question: why have the angels become silent? How could they speak once again? This article intends to answer the question by first recalling what the ancient doctrine of "separated substances" would suggest to a mathematician. But more importantly, beyond "substance" and even beyond the "messenger" role that the Bible gives them, angels seem to be endowed with a "poetic" dimension. The author attempts to elucidate this poetic function in connexion with what he calls the "meta" function.<br>

Abstract: Par sa notion de « lecture » et de « décréation », Simone Weil ébauche une philosophie critique en tant qu'analyse perceptive du réel que nos jugements font éclater, à tout instant, en une infinité de textes valorisés. Guidée par la méthode reflexive d'Alain et de Lagneau, elle dépasse la problématique phénoménologique des actes interprétatifs dans une herméneutique métaphysique. Le désir constitue alors le fondement de toute métaphorisation du réel à partir d'une conscience gestuelle où les signes, les symboles et les concepts préfigurent une transcendance absente, mais néanmoins réelle. Saisir, à la suite de Kant, cette contradiction en tout objet, c'est fonder la pratique perceptive sur le modèle christologique qui remplit par excellence la fonction d'une « métaphore réelle ». L'exigence proprement philosophique d'une telle synthèse permet de reconnaître une valeur originale à S. Weil dans le débat moderne autour de l'élaboration du signifié. Through her ideas of « lecture » and « décréation », Simone Weil sketches out a critical Philosophy as well as a perspective analysis of that which is real which our judgments, at every moment, split up into an endless number of valued texte. Guided by the reflexive method of Alain and of Lagneau, she goes beyond the phenomenological problematic of interpretative acts into a metaphysical hermeneutic. Desire then constitutes the foundation of every métaphorisation of the real starting with a consciousness in wich signs, symbols and concepts foreshadow an absent, but nevertheless real, transcendence. Taking hold of this contradiction in every object, following upon Kant, is to establish the perceptive practice on the christological model which fulfills belter than any other the function of a "real metaphor". The properly philosophical demand of such a synthesis allows us to recognize an original value in Simone Weil within the modern debate concerning the elaboration of that which is signified.<br>

Abstract: The frames that Lewis Carroll provided for the two Alice books have largely been ignored, when not simply dismissed, in recent Carroll criticism. Their conventional form and diction may account for this negative response, but examination of their provenance, their function within the structure of the two books, and the artistry evident in the individual frame components indicate how and why the frames are important to our understanding of Carroll's vision and purpose. The frame poems are designed to lead the reader into and away from the central dream tales through a process of lyric transformation and estrangement.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: This paper scrutinizes the fundamental assumption governing Gunther Teubner's theory of societal constitutionalism, namely that societal constitutions are ultimately about the regulation of inclusion and exclusion in global function systems. While endorsing the central role of inclusion/exclusion in constitutions, societal or otherwise, I argue that inclusion and exclusion are primordial categories of collective action, rather than functional categories. As a result, the self-closure which gives rise to a legal collective is spatial as much as it is temporal, and subjective no less than material. Inasmuch as legal orders must establish who ought to do what, where, and when, this entails, or so I argue, that any legal order we could imagine—including a global legal order such as cyberlaw—is necessarily bounded in space, time, content, and membership. This impinges directly on the inclusion/exclusion difference: that there can be no inclusion without exclusion entails, most fundamentally, that there can be no (il)legality without alegality, i.e. comportment that contests, sometimes radically, how a legal order draws the distinction between legality and illegality. In this fundamental sense, all legal orders have an outside—literally. Building on this insight, I suggest that the functional cosmopolitanism advocated by a theory of societal constitutionalism retains a residue of the logic of totalization it seeks to overcome. I conclude by exploring how a first-person plural theory of law both supports and transforms the insight that constitutions regulate the inclusion/exclusion difference by putting into place constitutive and limitative rules.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: Literary strategies such as footnoting and citation create relationality (in Ramazani and De Campos's sense). Citation practices are always bound up with questions of authority. In her theorization of intertextuality, influence, and imitation, Mary Orr offers the broader term “cultural recycling,” distinguishing between “unvoiced forms” (paraphrase, variant, translation) and more appropriative forms. Critique is inherent to cultural recycling, she notes: it has the practical function of “(re-)evaluation by means of comparison, counter-position and contrast.”
         
               She consequently identifies quotation and allusion as significant strategies for asserting authority. The quotation is always suggestively metonymic, with its “focusing and crystallizing function,” so that the part always sends back to the whole: “An utterance that verifies, authorizes, transports and redefines meanings across time and national boundary, quotation and its accomplice, allusion, name borrowing practices for very specific ends, whether authentication of or separation and autonomy from authorities.”73

Abstract: Further, the method of triggering nostalgia through music is appropriate since music and sound communicate directly to a reader's feelings. In doing so, they often become important connotations of memory. The long quotation above represents a good example of the musicality in Fitzgerald's prose, a matter discussed by Langman (31–40) and Bryer (123–27). This musicality is especially noticeable in the first half of the novel when it is designed to pull the reader into the ecstasy and presence of the narrative, as well as at the very end when there is a resolution of the two different nostalgic elements. The long winding sentences, where the subordinate clauses play with and complement each other, are not unlike the instruments in a string quartet. In the passage above, we find only four periods, which means there is a flow and a rhythm amidst repetitions. Asyndeton and polysyndeton function as pausing elements instead of periods. Asyndeton connects clauses through the use of comma, while polysyndeton primarily uses the word “and.” The repeating rhythm is most prominent in the enumeration of instruments in the beginning of the passage or in the phrase “the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names”; the several “and[s]” create a feeling of breathlessness, which can be compared to the hyper-excitement so often found in children when they experience something important and immediately want to try to tell someone about it. The specific phrasing in this case seems to emphasize action and eventfulness in an almost impressionistic manner, so that the atmosphere of the actual scene is syntactically transferred into the reader's experience. This is further enhanced by the aforementioned switch into present tense in the middle of the description, which minimizes the distance between the reader and the narrated impressions.<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Journal Title: Journal of Africana Religions<br>
Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The title of our journal,
         Journal of Africana Religions, evoked the mood expressed in Countee Cullen's poem. The use of the term, “Africana,” instead of Africa, is a sign of an ambiguity of meaning. Employing “Africana” instead of Africa gives the sense of something a bit indefinite or vague as well as derivative, varied, and even mysterious. In other words, “Africana” covers a wide range of meanings, ideas, and symbols regarding things pertaining to Africa—a kind of potpourri, an olio or constellation of places, modes, and qualities. As Elliot Skinner, the late African American anthropologist of Africa, put it, “Africa is like a mirror, and African scholarship often reveals more about the scholar than the continent whose cultures he seeks to describe. Indeed, the very shape of Africa, is a question mark, it is sphinx-like in its challenge to all scholars to find the proper key to an understanding of its diversity and complexity.”
               The function and meaning of “Africa” in creating modern knowledge was also raised twenty years later when Robert H. Bates, V. Y. Mudimbe, and Jean O'Barr, the editors of1
            Africa and the Disciplines: Contributions of Research in Africa to the Social Sciences and Humanities, argued that “debates regarding how Africa should be treated within the disciplines miss a profoundly significant point: that while the curriculum may be controlled by the disciplines,the study of Africa has helped to define the very disciplines … the study of Africa is already lodged in the core of the modern university.”

Abstract: We find one of the major conditions for this diversification in the growth of SPEP's membership and the number of participants on the programs. In its early days, when thirty or fewer people attended meetings, most sessions could be plenary, and people could expect during the conference conversations on papers and commentaries that everyone had heard. But as the members and range of interest increased, the number of sessions also increased to accommodate the volume of submissions and to lessen conflict with those who felt that their interests had inadequate representation on the programs. Growth brought with it complex new political problems involving incompatible points of view as well as gender and generational differences. The consequences of this growth included diversification and restructuring of the programs, an increased suspicion of and attention to the Executive Committee, an intensified alertness to exclusions, and the formation of a dynamic organization that had less and less to do with its name. These conditions helped to give birth to a new organizational arrangement where centralized power became increasingly fragmented. There was no one mission. There were multiple missions that gave rise to conflict and needed negotiation to function collaboratively, if often with suspicion of each other. But the revolution was not over.<br>

Abstract: The enormity of a particular exigence may be such that one of the only tropes capable of communicating the incommunicable is the one that so adamantly risks miscommunication. Hyperbole stirs one's emotions through the convergence of power and luminosity in a transcendental display of immanental insight that extends beyond the purview of logic and reason, thereby creating the intensity of
         vertige de l'hyperbole, which threatens to dismantle conventions of reason and rationality. Revealing that reason is madness and madness is reason through its “mad audacity,” this vertigo is precisely the disorienting crux of hyperbole's function of expressing the inexpressible and momentarily suspending presuppositions before they are re-oriented toward daring phenomenological and psychological reformulations.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Ricoeur's understanding of “appropriation.” One of the advantages of Ricoeur's formulation is that it recognizes the significance of readerly agency while not relying on the idea of a self-possessed subject. Ricoeur argues that appropriation should not be understood as a function of a sovereign subject who “would possess the key” to understanding. Rather, the reader of a text “exchange[s] the
         me,masterof itself, for theself,discipleof the text” (Ricoeur 2007, 37). Such a reader does not project him- or herself onto the text but receives “an enlarged self from the apprehension of proposed worlds which are the genuine object of interpretation” (Ricoeur1981, 182). The ability to perform this function depends on what Ricoeur calls “second-order reference,” which requires the reader to suspend concerns with whether the events “really” happened in order fully to understand the world opening up through her or his imaginative engagement with the text (Ricoeur1977, 216–56).
               This “world of the work” that reveals itself before the text becomes the referent of fictional narrative. When engaged in interpretation, then, the reader should seek to understand this “proposed world” as one “which I could inhabit and in which I could project my ownmost possibilities” (Ricoeur 2007, 36). Fictional narratives, then, ultimately create an imagined world that prepares readers to act their way into it, so to speak. In13
            Time and Narrative, Ricoeur explains that historical narrative employs a related but distinct “referential mode”: whereas fiction refers to an imagined world that could potentially be enacted in front of it, so to speak, historical narrative also claims to refer to an actual world that already exists behind it (1984, 1:82). Ricoeur productively blurs these distinctions inMemory, History, Forgetting, explaining that both types of narrative enable the reader to inhabit the “world of the text” (2004, 262).<br>

Abstract: To talk about hope is difficult without bringing faith into the conversation. The two terms often accompany one another in discourse and are frequently used interchangeably. Nevertheless, we can distinguish between them in ways that make a difference to thinking and that align them—as distinct concepts—more exactly with our day-to-day experience of living. From one angle, hope is a function of want and wish, and faith is a function of trust and conviction. The former expresses the yearning that our preferred outcomes come to be as events unfold, the latter the assurance that our longings will be realized in the fullness of time. Hope, then, dwells in the optative realm, faith in the declarative realm. Furthermore, faith implies hope, but not vice versa. If faith is a phenomenological presence in us at all, it necessarily reflects a subsidiary but related hopeful intentionality directed toward a desired future state of affairs. In this sense, faith entails hope. Conceptually, the two go together conjointly; it is hard to think faith without thinking hope. On the other hand, one can have hope without any correlative faith. The condemned criminal, for example, may desperately hope for a stay of execution but lack the abiding faith that the eleventh-hour phone call will come. Similarly, the terminally ill patient may passionately hope for a last-minute medical miracle but profoundly doubt that any such saving event will ever take place. Put simply, hope may exist absent faith, albeit passively and enfeebled, whereas if faith is present, hope will be too, in a kinetic form disposed toward energized, goal-directed behavior.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: One way to ensure a verifiable utopian dimension to works of architecture and urbanism (in addition to keeping the four elements introduced earlier in mind) would be to stay close to German sociologist Karl Mannheim's (1893–1947) definition of Utopia. Doing so provides claims to Utopia for architecture and urbanism with terms of criticism by which they could be analyzed more closely and carefully. In this way, the incongruence of such claims with Mannheim's definition of Utopia (and those of others) might be more readily ascertained: “However, we should not regard utopia as every state of mind which is incongruous with and transcends the immediate situation (and in this sense, ‘departs from reality’). Only those orientations transcending reality will be referred to by us as utopian which, when they pass over into conduct, tend to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which prevails at the time.”
         
               Divergence from Mannheim's definition is most explicitly observable in the degree to which most so-called utopian movements in architecture and urbanism collapse under the burden of their own ideological hollowness, confirmed by their inability, in Mannheim's words, “to shatter, either partially or wholly, the order which [prevailed] at the time … as [they pass] into conduct.”14
            
               As Manfredo Tafuri (1935–1994) observed, the reproduction function of architecture is all but inevitable, captured as it is within the cultural norms of the building industry in particular but more generally within the prevailing sociopolitical and economic conditions of capitalism, which led German philosopher of hope Ernst Bloch (1885–1977) to believe that to be “true,” as he called it, architecture would have to wait for radically transformed conditions to be renewed. In fact, when considered in this way, the utopian prospect of modern architecture was all but nonexistent; more so, it was rarely if ever the issue.15<br>
