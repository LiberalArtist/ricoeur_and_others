  1  Policy Polysemy and the 1935 Social Security Debates from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt16wd0hf">Invoking the Invisible Hand</a><br>
  Abstract: Americans know Social Security. They likely know it better than any other public policy. Whereas many policies appear distant from Americans’ everyday lives, seemingly addressed only to Washington insiders, Social Security touches ordinary citizens directly. For millions of Americans, Social Security has provided irreplaceable benefits to compensate for income lost through the tragic injury or death of a breadwinner. For millions more, Social Security has provided steady retirement benefits for oneself, a parent, or a grandparent, affirming, in the process, the honorific status of senior citizen. And virtually all Americans have experienced the rite of passage enacted by obtaining a<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MULLIN CAROLYN MERINO<br>
  Abstract: Virtually every aspect of society—from spam to broken relationships—has been curated in the museum field, and such is the case with mourning and death, albeit few and far between. Just a few thematic institutions exist, like the Museum of Mourning Art at the Arlington Cemetery (no reference to animals, as far as my research indicates) and the Museum of Death in Hollywood, California. The latter has a small gallery dedicated to taxidermy and jarred animal bodies, and the owners’ own potbellied pig, now stuffed, greets visitors as they enter the theater.<br>

  The “Hellenic” Rationality of Interreligious Dialogue: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1vjqqj6">Mimetic Theory and World Religions</a><br>
  Author(s) Astell Ann<br>
  Abstract: Simone Weil’s
                  The Need for Roots (L’Enracinement), written during the last months of her life (1909–43) and with her dying strength, is a fitting companion piece toBattling to the End (Achever Clausewitz), the last book by René Girard (b. 1923). Compatriots, Weil and Girard each retell the long story of French history from the Middle Ages, beginning in medias res and dwelling upon many of the same modern turning points—1789, 1815, 1914, 1940. Girard explicitly links his own childhood memories of the war years with the Free French radio broadcasts from London and the names of Maurice<br>

  2  HARDCASTLE (1962) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19633fp">Memory Work</a><br>
  Abstract: When Anne Truitt revealed her sculpture Hardcastle (plate 6) to the art critic Clement Greenberg in her Washington, DC, studio in 1962, he backed away while muttering under his breath, “Scares the shit out of me.”¹ This comment is noteworthy, for it indexes the experiential profundity that led Greenberg later to comment favorably on this and other minimal-type works by Truitt.² Yet Greenberg’s remark is striking for another reason as well, in that it captures the essence of what Truitt began trying to do in 1962: to evoke viscerally embodied responses to her work without making the human body an<br>

  Abstract: After his visit to Anne Truitt’s Twining Court studio in 1962, the critic Clement Greenberg made a bold assessment: “Now there will be three in Washington.”¹ His comment counted her in importance alongside the DC-based color field painters Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, who were prominently the subjects of his criticism, held in high esteem as the standard bearers of formalist modernism. Truitt, Louis, and Noland were also well known to one another in the tightly knit group of artists surrounding Washington’s Institute for Contemporary Art. Truitt rented the Twining Court studio, a coldwater carriage house, from Noland when he<br>

  CANTO XXVII  At the Threshold of Freedom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) CAMBON GLAUCO<br>
  Abstract: When Mario Sansone stated that Canto XXVII functions as a narrative pause between two climactic sequences (the rise through the three richly populated last cornices of the purgatorial mountain and the meeting with Matilda and Beatrice in the Terrestrial Paradise), he certainly did not mean to reduce Canto XXVII to merely a link lacking a poetical strength of its own. In fact, Sansone has added that the pauselike quality or narrative suspension following the poignant voice of Arnaut Daniel in the refining fire and foreshadowing the apparition of Matilda in the place of perennial springtime is counterpointed by an “ascending<br>

  CHAPTER 2  “Turning From the Shadows That Follow Us”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7rg">The Cosmic Time of Empire</a><br>
  Abstract: The 1884 Washington conference did not demonstrate the global consensus on universal civil time that Sandford Fleming and his apostles had hoped it might. Despite Fleming’s lofty rhetoric of cosmopolitan time for all purposes on earth, European delegates, as we have seen, were quick to keep separate the issues of cartographic longitude and universal civil time. The American delegates, Rodgers and Rutherford, diplomatically insisted in their concluding remarks that each government would have complete latitude over what uses, if any, it would make of a Greenwich-based civil time. For Fleming this capitulatory language was deeply frustrating. If the global map<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: Interpreting Musicis a comprehensive essay on understanding musical meaning and performing music meaningfully-"interpreting music" in both senses of the term. Synthesizing and advancing two decades of highly influential work, Lawrence Kramer fundamentally rethinks the concepts of work, score, performance, performativity, interpretation, and meaning-even the very concept of music-while breaking down conventional wisdom and received ideas. Kramer argues that music, far from being closed to interpretation, is ideally open to it, and that musical interpretation is the paradigm of interpretation in general. The book illustrates the many dimensions of interpreting music through a series of case studies drawn from the classical repertoire, but its methods and principles carry over to other repertoires just as they carry beyond music by workingthroughmusic to wider philosophical and cultural questions.<br>

The tract was modest in length but explosive in content: Fish wrote on behalf of the homeless, desperate English men and women, ″nedy, impotent, blinde, lame and sike,″ who pleaded for spare change on the streets of every city and town in the realm.

  Abstract: Immediately after Anwar Sadat’s accession to power in November 1970, the seemingly united front of Nasserism began to collapse. In less than a decade the authoritarian populism and socialist dogmatism of the previous era were replaced by a political system of authoritarian pluralism. Expanded and bureaucratically perfected by President Husni Mubarak since 1981, this new political system has had a paradoxical quality: For the liberalization of the political and cultural arenas and the diversification and privatization of the media and the economy did not undermine authoritarianism but only strengthened it. The puzzling irony of this counterintuitive sociopolitical system would probably<br>

  Abstract: Up to this point, with the exception of a brief discussion of Prudentius, this study has been concerned exclusively with Greek literature and thought. In fact, much of what has been discussed has been of Italian origin, from the archaic Pythagoreanism of southern Italy to the teachings of Plotinus and Porphyry in Rome. Virtually all the material examined, however, has been Greek in language and tradition. Traces of the Platonized Homer can be found in Latin authors as early as Apuleius,¹ a contemporary of Numenius, but there is no single work in Latin that explores at length the conception of<br>

The events that followed had more to do with the consolidation of the state than with the idea of independence. During the yearlong hiatus in the fighting, Indonesians turned their attention to matters of administration and governance, political routinization, and military reorganization.

  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing places controlled by their rivals as morally and physically dangerous, early Christian leaders fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it. Historical narratives that overlook the manipulation of physical places have obscured of the powerful forces that structured the development of early Christianity. the city of Antioch (present-day Antakya, Turkey) through some of the sensitive vocabulary of cultural geographers will demonstrate critical role of physical and rhetorical spatial contests in this city during the tumultuous fourth and fifth centuries C.E.

  Abstract: Les enseignants de langue font depuis longtemps figure de pionniers en matière de technologie. L’audio, la vidéo, les produits multimédia et autres DVD ont été progressivement intégrés dans la panoplie du professeur de langue et on s’est fréquemment interrogé sur leur rôle dans l’apprentissage. Les technologies de la communication sont venues s’y ajouter ces dix dernières années et la communication médiée par les systèmes informatiques soulève à son tour des interrogations. Ce nouvel environnement modifie certaines conditions d’apprentissage, en complexifiant les relations entre les principaux acteurs de la communication.

  Abstract: On March 2, 1964, Karl Barth met a group of theology students from Tubingen at the Bruderholz Restaurant for a lengthy conversation. The group consisted of forty Protestants and five Catholics. Their recorded conversation ranged across a wide spectrum of theological topics, including the meaning of Christ’s resurrection, the doctrine of analogy, the distinction between “noetic” and “ontic,” recent developments in Roman Catholicism, and the history of dialectical theology and the Confessing Church. At one point an unknown student raised the topic of Eberhard Jungel’s recent interpretation of Barth’s

  Abstract: As prominent warriors, community leaders, and heads of houses, the men of valor in Judges managed subordinates, manipulated superiors, and dealt with enemies. As was true in other patronage systems, success depended on their ability to exercise force and distribute wealth. However, they also relied on other political resources. Knowledge mongers as well as pursuers of military power and material riches, the heroes in Judges valued information as much as physical strength, adeptness with patronage, or the ability to administer a great house. In exploring the question of how the mighty men of valor gained and held power, this chapter<br>

  Abstract: The outer shell of a Kosta Boda bowl is thick glass. Since 1742, glassmaker Kosta Boda in Småland just south of Stockholm has been making artistic glassware that decorates many home interiors in Europe and North America. Kosta Boda glassware may look delicate, but it is sturdy. Normally, it does not need reinforcement. Duct tape would add nothing to its strength and would only detract from its beauty. Yet, a fragile soul might want to reinforce the exterior with spiritual duct tape, just in case. One brand of such duct tape is legalism, the most popular form of self-justification. We<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287gfz">Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: My account of metaphor and metonymy in the preceding chapters suggests that if the difference between them is fluid, if it is weak in purely structural terms, it can be strengthened by contextualization. But a more serious problem confronts the effort to keep metaphor and metonymy apart. I’ve called them two fundamental tropes, or figures, and this means that I have already taken for granted a prior distinction: the distinction between the literal (or proper) and the figurative uses of language.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n15">Myth and Scripture</a><br>
  Author(s) Page Hugh R.<br>
  Abstract: In this paper I will assess the strengths, weaknesses, and implications of the use of early Hebrew poems as a control group for the testing of single theories and methodological paradigms aimed at the reconstruction of myth, folklore, and social reality in ancient Israel. Here I build on the work done within the Albright-Cross-Freedman tradition on Gen 49; Exod 15; Num 23–24; Deut 32, 33; Judg 5; 1 Sam 2; 2 Sam 1, 22, 23; and Pss 18, 29, 68, 72, and 78 (see, e.g., Cross and Freedman 1952, 1997; Geller 1979; Cross 1973; Freedman 1980).

  Abstract: One of the most notorious aspects of ancient Greek myth was its frequent depiction of the gods as engaging in conduct that is morally problematic. The scandalous manner in which various myths portrayed the gods was doubtless one of the factors that made them popular in many social circles, but these same immoral depictions raised a number of serious intellectual and ethical questions that were debated at length throughout antiquity. The fundamental question was whether these common depictions of the gods were true. If so, the gods were often exemplars of vice rather than of virtue, and human morality was<br>

  Author(s) Green William Scott<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13wzvp4">Material Spirit: Religion and Literature Intranscendent</a><br>
  Author(s) PRANGER BURCHT<br>
  Abstract: In 2010 the National Gallery of London and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., organized an exhibition on seventeenth-century Spanish painting and sculpture under the name
                  The Sacred Made Real: Spanish Painting and Sculpture 1600–1700. The exhibition curators sought to show how the realism of the paintings of Velázquez, Ribalta, Zurbarán, and others had its roots in the artists’ sculptural approach to rendering figures and scenes in a two-dimensional medium. In turn, the painted, polychromed religious sculptures of the era represented real life—the real life of Christ, Mary, and the saints, that is. The most popular<br>

  Author(s) Mooney Timothy<br>
  Abstract: For more than a decade, Jean-Luc Marion has led us back to Husserl’s writings. The shadow cast by his interpretation serves as a shade that delivers us from an earlier blindness, letting us discriminate much that lay in obscurity. He has helped us to understand Husserlian phenomenology anew, foregrounding as he does the breakthrough to givenness (
                  donation). It may be possible, nonetheless, to show that his rendering is too severe in this or that instance, the very strength of its revelation having facilitated a certain occultation. Working in the other shadows of Merleau-Ponty and the early Derrida, we can look<br>

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing how the films dramatize these women's Christian call to serve, sacrifice, and dedicate themselves to God, and their erotic desire for intimacy, agency, achievement, and fulfillment.<br>

  Abstract: If anyone has suffered from typecasting, it is the cinematic nun.

  CHAPTER 4  Confucianism’s Political Implications for the Contemporary World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x026n">Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Herr Ranjoo Seodu<br>
  Abstract: Confucianism, as the dominant philosophical/cultural system of East Asia that has evolved over two millennia, is multidimensional and multilayered. Consequently, its interpretations diverge depending on which elements get emphasized and how they are arranged. Most, if not all, of such interpretations may contain some truth, but no one interpretation may capture the whole monolithic and unchangeable “Truth” of Confucianism. Confucianism is a
                  livingtradition in perpetual motion and survives through mutations, reflecting the needs and concerns of each generation of the cultural community. This does not mean that Confucianism does not contain some essence that would remain constant. Confucian values<br>

  Abstract: In the midst of war in Iraq and a color-coded campaign against terror, American Christians are waging an intense cultural battle over the sexual dynamics of sexual difference. Responding to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts (2004) and civil union in Vermont (2000) and Connecticut (2005), some of the nation’s largest Protestant denominations (e.g., the Southern Baptist Convention), evangelical political organizations (e.g., the Arlington Group, Focus on the Family, and the American Family Association), and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have devoted unparalleled resources to fighting similar threats to American moral values in other states.

  Author(s) KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: As it has done all along, the sensuous icon of Mary Magdalene flashes through popular culture, but with a curious difference now. The saint has found her voice. The recovery of certain ancient texts over the past century has made her speech possible. Some of these, such as the
                     Pistis Sophia,a lengthy third-century gnostic document, unfold such arcane mystical allegories that the speeches seem to lack all resonance with the familiar. But then an angry outburst disrupts the smooth psychopompic surface of the text. It brings us back to an all-too-familiar present—in some sense, to our own.<br>

  Book Title: A Scholar's Tale: Intellectual Journey of a Displaced Child of Europe-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HARTMAN GEOFFREY<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Geoffrey Hartman has been a pivotal figure in the humanities. In his first book, in 1954, he helped establish the study of Romanticism as key to the problems of modernity. Later, his writings were crucial to the explosive developments in literary theory in the late seventies, and he was a pioneer in Jewish studies, trauma studies, and studies of the Holocaust. At Yale, he was a founder of its Judaic Studies program, as well as of the first major video archive for Holocaust testimonies.Generations of students have benefited from Hartman's generosity, his penetrating and incisive questioning, the wizardry of his close reading, and his sense that the work of a literary scholar, no less than that of an artist, is a creative act. All these qualities shine forth in this intellectual memoir, which will stand as his autobiography. Hartman describes his early education, uncanny sense of vocation, and development as a literary scholar and cultural critic. He looks back at how his career was influenced by his experience, at the age of nine, of being a refugee from Nazi Germany in the Kindertransport. He spent the next six years at school in England, where he developed his love of English literature and the English countryside, before leaving to join his mother in America.Hartman treats us to a biobibliographyof his engagements with the major trends in literary criticism. He covers the exciting period at Yale handled so controversially by the media and gives us vivid portraits, in particular, of Harold Bloom, Paul de Man, and Jacques Derrida.SEND GEOFFREY COVER COPY All this is set in the context of his gradual self-awareness of what scholarship implies and how his personal displacements strengthened his calling to mediate between European and American literary cultures. Anyone looking for a rich, intelligible account of the last half-century of combative literary studies will want to read Geoffrey Hartman's unapologetic scholar's tale.<br>

  Abstract: “Strengthened by the Church’s sacrament and accompanied by the prayers of his Jesuit brothers, shortly after completing his eightieth year, Father Karl Rahner has gone home to God. He had loved the Church and his religious order and spent himself in their service.” So read part of the official Jesuit announcement of the death of Father Karl Rahner, S.J., on March 30, 1984. With his death, the Catholic Church lost one of her most loyal sons. Although well known for his controversial reinterpretations of the Christian tradition and for his criticisms of much in the Church’s practical life, Rahner always<br>

  Book Title: Political Theologies: Public Religions in a Post-Secular World-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SULLIVAN LAWRENCE E.<br>
  Abstract: What has happened to religion in its present manifestations? In recent years, Enlightenment secularization, as it appeared in the global spread of political structures that relegate the sacred to a private sphere, seems suddenly to have foundered. Unexpectedly, it has discovered its own parochialism-has discovered, indeed, that secularization may never have taken place at all.With the return of the religious,in all aspects of contemporary social, political, and religious life, the question of political theology-of the relation between politicaland religiousdomains-takes on new meaning and new urgency. In this groundbreaking book, distinguished scholars from many disciplines-philosophy, political theory, anthropology, classics, and religious studies-seek to take the full measure of this question in today's world. This book begins with the place of the gods in the Greek polis, then moves through Augustine's two cities and early modern religious debates, to classic statements about political theology by such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Carl Schmitt. Essays also consider the centrality of tolerance to liberal democracy, the recent French controversy over wearing the Muslim headscarf, and Bush's God talk.The volume includes a historic discussion between Jrgen Habermas and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, concerningthe prepolitical moral foundations of a republic, and it concludes with explorations of new, more open ways of conceptualizing society.<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, culture has become a cardinal object of tolerance and intolerance. This is not only because liberal democratic societies have become increasingly multicultural as a consequence of late-modern population flows and the affirmation of cultural difference over assimilation. It is also because political conflict has become, in Mahmood Mamdani’s phrase, “culturalized”: “It is no longer the market (capitalism), nor the state (democracy), but culture (modernity) that is said to be the dividing line between those in favor of a peaceful, civic existence and those inclined to terror.”¹ Mamdani credits Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis with conceptually catapulting culture<br>

  ONE  THE CULTIVATION OF THE IMAGINATION from:

  Abstract: For the two children, the season began as a wild dash—a race against the length of summer days.¹ But by mid-August, the days proved too long and hot for their short attention spans. The unconstrained freedom of vacation exhausted itself or, more accurately and more ironically, exposed itself as a type of aimless discontent. Freedom from chores, school, and responsibility revealed itself as boredom to me and my brother on a humid afternoon. The toys and blocks that had once riveted our attention lay thrown and neglected about the playroom. Haphazardly discarded games no longer occupied our full attention.<br>

  Book Title: Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Waldmeir John C.<br>
  Abstract: The metaphor of the Church as a bodyhas shaped Catholic thinking since the Second Vatican Council. Its influence on theological inquiries into Catholic nature and practice is well-known; less obvious is the way it has shaped a generation of Catholic imaginative writers. Cathedrals of Bone is the first full-length study of a cohort of Catholic authors whose art takes seriously the themes of the Council: from novelists such as Mary Gordon, Ron Hansen, Louise Erdrich, and J. F. Powers, to poets such as Annie Dillard, Mary Karr, Lucia Perillo, and Anne Carson, to the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright John Patrick Shanley. Motivated by the inspirational yet thoroughly incarnational rhetoric of Vatican II, each of these writers encourages readers to think about the human body as a site-perhaps the most important site-of interaction between God and human beings. Although they represent the body in different ways, these late-twentieth-century Catholic artists share a sense of its inherent value. Moreover, they use ideas and terminology from the rich tradition of Catholic sacramentality, especially as it was articulated in the documents of Vatican II, to describe that value. In this way they challenge the Church to take its own tradition seriously and to reconsider its relationship to a relatively recent apologetics that has emphasized a narrow view of human reason and a rigid sense of orthodoxy.<br>

  2.  Writing and the Catholic Body: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0bn7">Cathedrals of Bone: The Role of the Body in Contemporary Catholic Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: Mary Gordon has said of that marvelous pre–Vatican II writer Flannery O’Connor that “For O’Connor, the habit of art … began with the habit of looking. It was,” Gordon insists, “the peculiar habit of her genius.” Several of Gordon’s own critics have used similar terminology to describe the role of “looking” in her art as well. Some have made their references to highlight strengths in Gordon’s prose. Kathryn Hughes, for example, praises Gordon for her “minute observation.”¹ Anita Gandolfo values Gordon’s art for its “prophetic vision” and its ability to bring Catholic issues into “sharper focus.”² Others have been<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Abstract: The Center for Hellenic Studies, located on a wooded campus in Washington, D.C., is a privately endowed residential research institute affiliated with Harvard University. At its core is a specialized library devoted to ancient Greek literature, history, philosophy, and related fields. Each academic year the Center offers ten Junior Fellowships to an international group of Hellenists in the earlier stages of their careers, as well as a Summer Session for postdoctoral scholars who need ready access to a strong research library. In addition, the Center has recently begun an annual Colloquium series.<br>

  Author(s) OESTERREICHER WULF<br>
  Abstract: The subject of the following article is orality in text. Although this term may seem paradoxical at first, the formulation reflects a fundamental distinction, which is discussed at some length in the first part of the article. In the second part, some examples from the field of Romance philology are given to show not only the applicability but also the importance of this distinction and the concepts associated with it. In the main part of my argument, a typology of orality in written texts is presented. This typology is illustrated by Latin documents, because these are easily accessible and generally<br>

  Chapter Five  WOTAN’S MONOLOGUE AND THE MORALITY OF MUSICAL NARRATION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0rk0">Unsung Voices: Opera and Musical Narrative in the Nineteenth Century</a><br>
  Abstract: Human narrators come in many forms. Some are completely reliable: most epic narrators speak with detachment, and thus with authority. They elicit trust. But human narrators may also be revealed as immoral by giving tongue to lies, by speaking themselves buffoons, unreliable, or dubious. Then their stories will
                  ring false, for while we may notknowthat the story is a lie, something about its presentation betrays its teller. When narration is allied to music, sensing truth demands doubly acute ears. Strauss’s Clytaemnestra says, “was die wahrheit ist, das dringt kein mensch heraus” [“what is true, what is untrue, no<br>

  Abstract: “Guerre à la rhétorique et paix à la syntaxe!” With this warcry Victor Hugo declared, in his oft-quoted Réponse
                  á un acte d’accusation(1854), donning the mantle of a romantic Malherbe (“Alors . . . je vins . . .”) that he had brought about a “quatre-vingt-treize” in French literature. Concerning the nature of his campaign against rhetoric, Hugo tells us two things: at his very appearance, he says, all metaphors fled in terror to hide beneath the robes of the “Academie, aieule et douairiere”; but at the same time he lets us know, as so often in his lyrical<br>

What is meant by "military honor," and does it really affect the contemporary soldier? Is human dignity possible under battlefield conditions?<br>

  Abstract: The title of this volume—
                  The Wisdom and the Foolishness of God—is drawn from the paradoxical maxim that Paul enunciates in 1 Cor. 1:25: “for the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (translations from the New Testament my own). Paul’s arresting expression borders on blasphemy: to speak of the foolishness and the weakness of God is to contradict standard assumptions about the divine, assumptions necessary to maintain God’s status as God. The way Paul’s maxim has reverberated down the centuries, spawning one form of radical theology after<br>

  14  The Cross of Christ and God’s Power from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155j3m5">The Wisdom and Foolishness of God</a><br>
  Author(s) Vial Marc<br>
  Abstract: In 1 Cor. 1:23–24, Paul writes: “we proclaim Christ nailed to the cross; … he is the power of God and the wisdom of God,” before adding, in v. 25, that “the weakness of God is stronger than human strength” (reb). The link between the cross of Christ and the power of God is thus explicitly made by Paul. Consequently, one must ask whether it is possible, in a Christian theological perspective, to think about something we may call God’s “almightiness” from the event of the cross and, first, from the “word of the cross” around which the second<br>

  Book Title: Douglas Coupland-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tate Andrew<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first full-length study of Douglas Coupland, one of the twenty-first century’s most innovative and influential novelists. The study explores the prolific first decade and a half of Coupland’s career, from Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture (1991) to JPod (2006), a period in which he published ten novels and four significant volumes of non-fiction. Emerging in the last decade of the twentieth century - amidst the absurd contradictions of instantaneous global communication and acute poverty - Coupland’s novels, short stories, essays and visual art have intervened in specifically contemporary debates regarding authenticity, artifice and art. This book explores Coupland’s response, in ground-breaking novels such as Microserfs, Girlfriend in a Coma and Miss Wyoming, to some of the most pressing issues of our times. Designed for students, researchers and general readers alike, the study is structured around thematically focused chapters that consider Coupland’s engagement with narrative, consumer culture, space, religion and ideas of the future.<br>

  4  Prophecies and predictions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jdgf">Time and world politics</a><br>
  Abstract: IN the previous two chapters we have been exploring philosophical accounts of political time. In this and subsequent chapters we examine readings of contemporary world politics and the different ways in which they rely on and reproduce configurations of the relation between
                  chronosandkairosin their accounts of the world-political present. In this chapter our focus is on interpretations of the nature and direction of world politics after the Cold War, including the popular ‘end of history’ and ‘clash of civilisations’ narratives offered by Fukuyama and Huntington, and responses from the social science of International Relations during the 1990s.<br>

In all cases, it was clear that predominant voices in the social science of international politics, in post-Kantian theories of cosmopolitan democracy and in post-Marxist accounts of ‘empire’ and ‘multitude’ relied upon accounts of the relation betweenchronosandkairosthat echoed arguments previously encountered in Chapter 2.

  Book Title: Jonathan Lethem-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Peacock James<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Lethem is the first full-length study dedicated to the work of an exciting, genre-busting contemporary writer with an increasingly high profile in American literature. Examining all of Lethem’s novels, as well as a number of his short fictions, essays and critical works, this study shows how the author’s prolific output, his restlessness and his desire always to be subverting literary forms and genres, are consistent with his interest in subcultural identities. The human need to break off into small groupings, subcultures or miniature utopias is mirrored in the critical tendency to enforce generic boundaries. To break down the boundaries between genres, then, is partly to make a nonsense of critical distinctions between 'high' and 'low' literature, and partly to reflect the wider need to recognise difference, to appreciate that other people, no matter how outlandish and alien they may appear, share similar desires, experiences and problems. With this in mind, James Peacock argues that Lethem’s experiments with genre are not merely games or elaborate literary jokes, but ethical necessities, particularly when viewed in the light of the losses and traumas that shadow all of his writing. Jonathan Lethem, therefore, makes an important contribution not just to Lethem studies, but also to debates about genre and its position in postmodern or 'post-postmodern' literature. It will be of interest to all scholars and students of contemporary American writing, as well as those interested in genre fiction and literature’s relationship with subcultures.<br>

  Abstract: Like many Egyptians, I have witnessed religious practice and consciousness evolve over the past two decades across generations inside my family, within my wider social setting, and in Cairo as a whole. My experiences within Muslim communities in Canada and the United Kingdom have sensitized me to the strength of similar patterns of religious identification in these communities. Perhaps contrary to the expectations of many westerners, Cairenes are becoming more religiously observant and more consciously Muslim, than they were in the 1940s, 1950s, or 1960s.

  Book Title: Opening the Bible-Selected Writings of Antony Campbell SJ<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony<br>
  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length of an article or a talk. Addressed originally to thinking people, we at ATF believe they are likely to be of interest to a wide audience."<br>

  Abstract: As a Bible person, it maddens me to read claims that creationism takes the Bible literally. It does not. There are numerous portrayals of creation in the Bible and there are radical differences between them. Three of the combat variety are noted by way of allusion and reference. They portray a picture of creation by combat between the God of Israel and the forces of chaos. They portray a picture of creation that should send shivers down a creationist’s spine. No wonder these portrayals do not get a mention. Two others are lengthier, more direct, and better known to us.<br>

The United States had not officially entered World War II at that time, but the government noted with some concern a growing Nazi influence in South America and was seeking to counter that influence by promoting friendly ties between the Americas. Disney did make the trip, along with a group of his artists, and thus began a chain of events which eventually produced two feature-length pictures,<br>

  Book Title: John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2-Aspects of Historicity in the Fourth Gospel<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Thatcher Tom<br>
  Abstract: This groundbreaking volume draws together an international group of leading biblical scholars to consider one of the most controversial religious topics in the modern era: Is the Gospel of John-the most theological and distinctive among the four canonical Gospels-historical or not? If not, why does John alone among the Gospels claim eyewitness connections to Jesus? If so, why is so much of John's material unique to John? Using various methodologies and addressing key historical issues in John, these essays advance the critical inquiry into Gospel historiography and John's place within it, leading to an impressive consensus and convergences along the way. The contributors are Paul N. Anderson; Mark Appold; Richard Bauckham; Helen K. Bond; Richard A. Burridge; James H. Charlesworth; Jaime Clark-Soles; Mary Coloe; R. Alan Culpepper; Craig A.

  Abstract: As I prepared this paper, a joke often came to mind of a traveler on his way to a city, finding himself lost in the countryside (perhaps I should say “boondocks”—we might imagine a traveler to Washington, D.C., somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains). He stops to ask directions of a local he finds leaning on a fencepost. “Tell me,” he asks, “how do I get to Washington, D.C.?” “Well,” comes the reply, “if I was going there, I wouldn’t start from here.”<br>

  Abstract: Despite a general preference for the Synoptic Gospels, several features of John’s narrative have often commanded a certain historical respect: the lengthier ministry and its wider geographical location, the more complex relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist, the date of the crucifixion, and the passage that concerns us now—John’s Jewish interrogation of Jesus (Smith 1993, 252–67). C. H.

  Abstract: Sacramental practice suffers, in a fairly general way, from a strong ambiguity. Quite widespread in Brazilian Lutheranism—and, if I am seeing correctly, in Catholicism too—is an individualist, magical, and uncommitted understanding of the efficacy of the sacraments. It refers to the practice of the sacraments as a holy recourse to divine forces, able to remedy problems and existential angst—even physical illnesses—without resulting in a deepening of faith, strengthening of community, and a commitment to love of the neighbor.<br>

  Abstract: Almost nobody noticed. On New Year’s Day 1972, every second of every official clock was “shortened” by a small but significant amount. The velocity of planet earth was slowing, and scientists needed clock time to reflect this delay. By the last decades of the twentieth century, atomic clocks had improved so much that the scientific community in charge of timekeeping felt confident to base time measurements on them. In consequence, they authorized a change in the length of every subsequent second till kingdom come.<br>

  2  The Shopping Mall as the Paradigmatic Figure of Neocolonial Discourse: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183gzrq">Religion Without Redemption</a><br>
  Abstract: In social reality, the processes of fetishisation and de-fetishisation (resistance and struggle) are composed of multiple discourses that legitimise, strengthen and configure them with the break from domination. The constitution of social reality is constantly being transformed, due to conflict, tensions and shifts between power(s) and counter-power(s). However, after more than five centuries of imperial, colonial and capitalist domination and exploitation, we observe that the political asymmetry, economic inequality and ethno-racial injustice have become more acute in peripheral societies. Is it possible that the ‘structural sin’ – to borrow a term from the theologists of liberation – continues to take its toll<br>

  13  Production, Nature and Technology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p184">Small Places, Large Issues</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea that there is an interrelationship between ecological conditions and ways of life can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, and it was also prevalent in Enlightenment thought in the mid eighteenth century (for instance in Montesquieu and in the Marquis de Sade’s non-pornographic writings). Montesquieu, like many others, held that the main cause of Europe’s technological and scientific advances was the harsh climate, which required the inhabitants to be inventive and sharp-witted to survive. Two centuries later, the human geographer Ellsworth Huntington (1945) argued for climatic determinism in an original study where he shows, among other things,<br>

  3.  STRANGERS IN THE PARK: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q3bk">Cities of Affluence and Anger</a><br>
  Abstract: In an essay on Oxford Street, the longtime center of London’s gaudy, cut-price shopping district, Virginia Woolf casually remarks that “the charm of modern London is that it is not built to last; it is built to pass.” Woolf surprisingly chooses Oxford Street, rather than one of London’s innumerable historic sites, as an emblem of the capital precisely because it foregrounds the transitory qualities of modern urban life. London’s historic houses and monuments, bestowed on the city by aristocratic patrons, “required the illusion of permanence.” By contrast, Woolf delights in the ephemerality of the city’s tacky, cacophonous, ostentatious retail industry<br>

  Book Title: Interrogating Cultural Studies-Theory, Politics and Practice<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Bowman Paul<br>
  Abstract: This book presents an original and innovative new approach to the field of cultural studies in the form of a series of dynamically executed interviews with some of the world’s leading and some of the most challenging emergent cultural theorists, from both sides of the Atlantic and beyond: Professor Mieke Bal, Professor Catherine Belsey, Professor Steven Connor, Professor Simon Critchley, Professor Thomas Docherty, Dr Jeremy Gilbert, Professor Sue Golding, Professor Lynette Hunter, Dr Martin McQuillan, Professor John Mowitt, Professor Christopher Norris, Professor Griselda Pollock, Professor Adrian Rifkin, Professor Jeremy Valentine, Professor Julian Wolfreys, and Professor Slavoj Zizek are all included here. The book is framed by lively and informative introductions, which introduce the work of these thinkers, and which also introduce the reader to the crucial importance of the issues that the interviews address. The result is an entertaining and hugely useful introduction to the key ideas in the field, the strengths and problematic weaknesses of cultural studies as a discipline, allowing the reader to chart its development, and to identify emerging trends. This book is ideal for students of cultural studies and the interdisciplinary arts and humanities, and will be of great interest to teachers and researchers working within a very wide range of areas of cultural studies.<br>

  Abstract: In his discussion on the best possible relationship between science and non-science (in which he included religion and the arts), Friedrich Nietzsche decided on the image of human beings having ‘a double brain’: a brain with two chambers lying next to one another, as it were, separable and self-contained, and experiencing different things without confusion (1994: 154). An experience of both science and non-science was necessary for human health, Nietzsche deemed, but at the same time the two had to be kept apart.

                  L’Evénement du jeudi. Below the photograph was a caption which read: ‘Bourdieu, the most powerful intellectual in France’. Inside the magazine, a lengthy ‘dossier’ discussed the perceived strengths and weaknesses of Bourdieu’s work.¹ That same month, similar ‘dossiers’ dedicated to Bourdieu appeared in the other principal French weeklies and dailies,Le Nouvel observateur, Libération, L’ExpressandLe Monde.² As the satirical French weeklyLe Canard enchaînéput it, ‘Bourdieumania’ seemed to have broken out in the<br>

  Abstract: In what ways do truth commissions transform the ways in which citizens of contemporary societies think and speak about historical truth, justice, reconciliation, and official historiography? Transitional justice mea sures, and truth commissions in particular, try to raise awareness around histories of violence and violations in the context of rebuilding state institutions and national identity.¹ Most truth commissions combine meticulous human rights investigation with a critique of the national past in order to rebuild the nation.² Aside from pursuing such goals as delivering a measure of justice and reconciliation, avoiding future violence, strengthening democratic institutions, and enhancing peace and stability,<br>

  Abstract: There is only one way to properly understand Thomas Paine. He is the expatriate Briton whose intense belief in radical republican politics made him, this son of Norfolk Quakers, the writer of the American Revolution. Paine is the thinker whose political imaginary led him, in the moment before the thirteen colonies became independent, to coin no less than the phrase the “United States of America.” Paine’s faith in the American Revolution led him to dedicate Rights of Man, a “small treatise in defence of . . . [the] Principles of Freedom,” to President George Washington, “that the Rights of Man<br>

  Abstract: Mega biblion, mega kakon, pronounced the Alexandrian sage Callimachus in the early third century BC: “Big book, big problem.” Callimachus was not speaking metaphorically. It was a literal complaint about the lengthy efforts of his contemporary and rival, Apollonius of Rhodes, whose epic on Jason and the Argonauts, written in deliberate imitation of Homer, was all the rage in the court of the early Ptolemies. Since Apollonius’ book has never quite made its way into the central literary nexus (Harold Bloom, for instance, did not include it in his list of masterworks inThe Western Canon), Callimachus’ quip might be<br>

  Author(s): Blum Hester<br>
  Abstract: American literary studies has undergone a series of field redefinitions over the past two decades that have been consistently described as "turns," whether transnational, hemispheric, postnational, spatial, temporal, postsecular, aesthetic, or affective. In
         Turns of Event, Hester Blum and a splendid roster of contributors explore the conditions that have produced such movements. Offering an overview of the state of the study of nineteenth-century American literature, Blum contends that the field's propensity to turn, to reinvent itself constantly without dissolution, is one of its greatest strengths.<br>

  Abstract: From May 1934 to June 1937, Sofía del Valle traveled the length and breadth of the United States on a mission. Mexican Catholic officials had given del Valle two fundamental tasks. First, del Valle endeavored to sway American Catholic public opinion in favor of her coreligionists in Mexico, to convince American Catholics that their brothers and sisters to the south were suffering a kind of modern-day martyrdom, mercilessly persecuted by a faction of anticlerical leaders who had risen to power in the wake of the 1910 revolution.¹ Second, del Valle’s mission was to raise as much money as possible for<br>

  3  Toward a Theological Engagement of Early Childhood from:

  Abstract: Both theology and psychoanalysis draw upon narrative in their common search for greater understanding of human weakness and the possibility of human wholeness. In theology, such narratives range from biblical to confessional literature, as well in the twentieth century to the positing of narrative theology either in place of or as complement to systematic theology.¹ Theology has as its chief end greater understanding of the divine and of the relationship of the divine to creation, in particular to humankind. That project has led theologians to consider human nature and behavior at great length, often with impassioned interest, although not always<br>

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Abstract: Si l’on en croit l’historiographie courante, les années quatre-vingt sonneraient le glas du nouage séculaire de la littérature française et de la contestation politique. Les contemporanéistes ont tour à tour diagnostiqué le déclin de la figure classique de l’intellectuel apparue lors de l’Affaire Dreyfus, la disparition des avant-gardes à la fois littéraires et politiques auxquelles la Grande Guerre et la Révolution d’Octobre avaient donné naissance et que les années soixante avaient vu resurgir, enfin l’épuisement de la théorie et de la pratique de la littérature engagée telle que Sartre l’avait imposée à la Libération.<br>

  Abstract: Au début des années quatre-vingt-dix en Italie, l’étude de la littérature française du présent comptait quelques adeptes qui partageaient souvent cette tâche avec celle sur la littérature des autres saisons, considérées, celles-ci, comme consolidées par le temps. Nul n’envisageait que les incursions dans la prose d’une extrême actualité puissent devenir un domaine scientifique autonome. À la limite, on considérait ces “ digressions” occasionnelles comme un appendice de la littérature du XX
                  èmesiècle, comme l’expression d’une certaine excentricité de la part de qui s’y consacrait. Les promoteurs solitaires de tentatives extratemporelles étaient, à l’époque, retenus des scientifiques marginaux, dont les ambitions<br>

  Abstract: One of Benjamin’s more unexpected citations can be found in his letter to his friend Gershom Scholem, dated Paris June 12, 1938. As far as I am aware it is the only time that he cites at length from a Gifford Lecture, the distinguished series founded in 1888 and intended “to promote and diffuse the study of natural philosophy in the widest sense of the term—in other words, the knowledge of God.” I am referring to the citation from Arthur Stanley Eddington’s influential presentation of the revolutionary advances in early twentieth century cosmology (the theory of relativity and subatomic<br>

  Author(s) Godin Emmanuel<br>
  Abstract: What is exceptional about the French extreme right today? Pascal Perrineau (1997: 10–11) suggests that what distinguishes the Front National (FN) from previous French extreme-right parties or movements is the strength and longevity of its electoral success. From
                  boulangismein the late nineteenth century to the rise of the Leagues in the interwar period, from the Poujadist wave of the 1950s to the defence of French Algeria in the mid-1960s, the French extreme right’s electoral success had always been as intense as it was ephemeral. Conversely, since its first successes in local and European elections in the early 1980s,<br>

  Abstract: ‘Revolutionaries of the J.-P. Sartre style have never disturbed the sleep of any banker in the world’.¹ So asserted Raymond Aron in 1952, and in the absence of any more extensive research on insomnia in the financial services industry we shall have to take his word for it. Yet bankers, by the nature of their trade, are immersed in the short term, the day-to-day fluctuations of the market. They are not the most sensitive judges of the longterm permeation of ideas and values which can eventually have a major impact on social change.<br>

  Author(s) Shimada Shingo<br>
  Abstract: The revival of interest in cultural identity, now a key issue in world politics and likely to remain so for some time, is an outcome of the end of the so-called Cold War. The Cold War order that had defined world politics and had assumed economic and political bipolarity is no longer dominant. ‘Culture’ has been rediscovered in an effort to explain obvious differences between states (Huntington, 1993). However, in view of the seemingly endless conflicts in many parts of the world it is increasingly doubtful whether we can justly understand and interpret conflicting realities on the basis of our<br>

  54  Stirring the Ashes: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) ANSLEY FRANCES LEE<br>
  Abstract: The “class model” of white supremacy portrays it as a means to justify and enhance class dominance and thus to strengthen existing relations of economic power. This function gives racism its central status in American political life and assures its survival. This is the source of racism’s strength and resilience. The class model addresses how, in a white supremacist system, the poor people of all races come out on the short end while the people of the dominant classes appear to extract extraordinary benefits.<br>

  Abstract: Focusing solely on the sexual exploitation of women hides both racist oppression and the strength, struggles, and multiple interests of women of color. The experience of being a woman of color cannot be understood in any way that sees only what is done to women generally. White people will think racially as whites without thinking “about race,” because we tend to equate “race” with “non-white.” We will not understand that we are thinking racially when we are not thinking about people of color. This aspect of our experience as white women will shape what we do, but it will be<br>

  2  “The Novel That Took the Place of a Poem”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cd0kr0">Wallace Stevens among Others</a><br>
  Abstract: The collocation of Wallace Stevens and queer discourse, for some, is likely to be somewhat of a stretch. I say this not with an eye to the second element of my chapter’s subtitle, but principally to the poet designated in the first. “Queer is hot,” after all (Berlant and Warner 343). Stevens is not. Nor, I would hazard, has he ever been. To the contrary, Wallace Stevens, through the years, has garnered the canonical reputation, as Joseph Harrington observes, of “a retiring aesthete writing verses,” one who “loathed reading in public” and who was prone “to block out or keep<br>

  Author(s) Harmon Steven R.<br>
  Abstract: I first encountered the thought of Gregory of Nyssa, the youngest of the three great “Cappadocian Fathers” of the fourth century and arguably the most enduringly significant constructive theologian among them, in an undergraduate course in Christian doctrine. Like many beginning students in Christian theology, I was introduced to Gregory in connection with atonement theory. In the tradition of Protestant systematic theologies that list five or six major atonement theories chronologically and then evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, my textbook identified Gregory as a major representative of the “classical” or “ransom theory of the atonement.² According to Gregory’s development of<br>

  3  Rollback from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cg4n1q">Dealing with Dictators</a><br>
  Abstract: The year 1948 saw a basic shift in American policymakers’ attitudes toward Soviet control of European territory. The idea of peaceful cooperation, nurtured up to then by many British and American politicians and diplomats, was shattered. The last Eastern European democracy, Czechoslovakia, had been amalgamated into the Soviet camp and closed off, although, almost miraculously, Finland was released from Moscow’s grasp. Washington no longer saw Soviet control as a stabilizing factor in Eastern Europe. Instead, the restoration of independent states and the rollback of Soviet military power became the prerequisites of a secure and lasting continental peace. The goal thenceforth<br>

  Abstract: The failure of the 1956 revolution shattered the notion that the European status quo could be changed without the consent of the Soviet Union. Washington was forced to take a hard look at the European situation, and over the course of a decade they concluded that there was nothing they could do to reverse the continental division. The calculation that Europe would remain divided for the foreseeable future was not based solely on the United States’s inability to influence the power structure behind the Iron Curtain. The domestic and foreign policies of communist states like Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia also<br>

  Book Title: Reading Scripture with the Saints-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Fowl Stephen E.<br>
  Abstract: Reading Scripture with the Saints is a small museum. On its pages hang portraits of Christianity’s “masters of the sacred page": Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Benedict of Nursia, Maximus Confessor, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther and Charles Wesley. Other, surprising figures also appear, such as Shakespeare, Washington and Lincoln. How did these figures from history interpret Scripture? What might their diverse approaches teach today’s readers of the Old and New Testaments? What is missing in contemporary biblical interpretation that an awareness of the history of exegesis might complete? Join C. Clifton Black as he traverses the Bible, Church History, systematic theology, Elizabethan drama and American politics. Reading Scripture with the Saints retrieves pre-modern insights for a post-modern world.<br>

  Author(s) Rowland Tracey<br>
  Abstract: Caritas in Veritateis the most recent in a long list of papal interventions in the territory of social justice, and for most commentators there was nothing surprising in the document apart from its extraordinary length and the way in which it sought to offer a comprehensive overview of the whole tradition rather than isolating a couple of issues and focusing upon them. It was as if Benedict XVI reviewed the tradition, made an executive summary of what he regards as its most significant elements, and gave his papal stamp of approval to them, at the same time as enriching<br>

  Abstract: Biblical texts are not the only ancient texts with a significant interpretative afterlife. Western culture has also had a lengthy relationship of rereading with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome—this is the origin of the “Western philosophical tradition,” which I contrasted with the Jewish tradition of biblical interpretation in chapter one. In this chapter, I will turn to a brief examination of Sophocles’
                  Antigoneand its history of interpretation as a window into the way that discourse over mourning and ownership of the dead has developed. This discussion will provide a framework for the readings of Canadian material<br>

  Author(s): Routhier Gilles<br>
  Abstract: Le deuxième concile du Vatican (1961-1965) fut l'un des événements religieux les plus importants du vingtième siècle. Au Canada, il coïncida avec une période de changements culturels et sociétaux sans précédent, entraînant chez les évêques catholiques canadiens un réexamen de la place et de la mission de l'Église dans le monde. Pendant quatre ans, les évêques catholiques canadiens se réunirent avec leurs collègues de partout dans le monde pour réfléchir aux questions urgentes qui se posaient à l'Église et en débattre. Ce livre bilingue étudie l'interprétation et la réception de Vatican II au Canada, analysant diverses questions, dont le rôle des médias, les réactions des autres chrétiens, les contributions des participants canadiens, l'impact du Concile sur la pratique religieuse et sa contribution à la progression du dialogue interreligieux.<br>

  Abstract: Le processus actuel de mondialisation culturelle présuppose – cela va tellement de soi qu’on l’oublie – l’achèvement de l’entreprise de découverte du monde, amorcée depuis le Moyen Âge par l’Occident avec les voyages d’exploration. Cette découverte du monde visait conjointement la conquête scientifique et la domination politique, avec ses corrélats, la christianisation ou l’exploitation économique. Si l’écrit est resté longtemps déterminant pour la dimension médiale du discours de la découverte, la dimension visuelle qui a gagné en importance au fil du temps retient de plus en plus l’attention des chercheurs¹. Les configurations médiales du discours sont tributaires du savoir et<br>

Longtemps, la fonction qu’eut la technique photographique sur la formation de cette discipline a été éclipsée par l’apparente « transparence » des reproductions qu’elle autorisait.

  Abstract: Il y a vingt-cinq ans, si on marchait dans les rues de n’importe quelle grande ville d’un pays du Sud, on pouvait apercevoir des personnes souffrant de la poliomyélite. Avec leurs membres atrophiés, tordus ou paralysés, ces gens étaient faciles à repérer. Beaucoup d’entre eux survivaient en mendiant. Aujourd’hui, très peu de gens sont affectés par cette maladie infectieuse. À la fin des années 1980, on répertoriait plus de 350 000 nouveaux cas de polio chaque année alors qu’en 2012, on comptait moins de 250 cas dans le monde, soit une réduction de 99,9 %.

  5  Intuitionism and Little Theory from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ch7988">Red, White, and Blue</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapters have explained the important role that grand theory plays in the liberal tradition. They have also suggested that grand theory cannot be made coherent today because of the erosion of the republican tradition. So far, though, we have considered only one theory at a time. Perhaps the theories could be combined so that their strengths reinforce each other and the strengths of one cancel the weaknesses of another. Unfortunately that strategy will not work. In discussing each grand theory I made two general kinds of arguments. First I developed an internal critique of the theory. That critique<br>

  Author(s) GINGELL SUSAN<br>
  Abstract: The call to include Aboriginal oral traditions in post-secondary English department curricula was among the urgings of the Canadian Association of Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies’ roundtable on Aboriginal Literatures in 2000, and this paper considers ways of beginning to answer that call. Roy Harris has suggested in his book
                  The Origin of Writingthat the West has “a scriptist bias,” a bias based on the idea that writing is an “idealization which captures those essential features often blurred and distorted in the rough and tumble of everyday utterance” (46).

  Abstract: L’intégration européenne est une expérience grandeur nature du contact des langues. Passée il y a plus d’un an de 12 à 15 membres et de 9 à 11 langues, l’Union Européenne (U.E.) ne cesse d’avoir un effet de loupe sur le changement linguistique, sur les transferts linguistiques. Pour nombre de pays, depuis longtemps adhérents du Marché Commun puis de la CEE et à la langue souvent d’assez large diffusion (français, allemand, anglais, espagnol, etc.), cet effet peut ne pas apparaitre, ou sembler très secondaire.

Literally, according toPublishers Weekly(2011, online), Brooks broke barriers and made publishing history with sales of all formats (hardcover, paperback, audio) reaching 600,000 within just five years of the book’s release. The 2013 release of the feature-length film produced by and starring Brad Pitt only served to help further boost sales of the novel (“Best Sellers” 2006, online), making sure it remained on top-sellers lists long after its initial publication.¹ Not only isWorld War<br>

  Abstract: Walking through Washington Square in New York City, I discovered this inscription cut into a monument: “The event is in the hand of God.” Though poetically articulated, this is of course an imprecise statement, because God, rather, is always in the hands of the event. That is to say, God is something other than the omnipresent demiurge who pronounced the words “fiat lux.” Perhaps what we call God is only the blink of an eye at the instant the voice resounded: Let there be light. It may well have been the combined and undefined vibration of matter and perception, of<br>

I present here an unpublished 1988 student assignment as a conduit for my ideas on the value of oral tradition in the anthropology classroom, the construction of anthropological kinship networks, and the ways in which both anthropology professors and their students have persisted in telling and retelling the histories of anthropology over time.

  Book Title: Artifacts and Illuminations-Critical Essays on Loren Eiseley<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska Paperback<br>
  Author(s): MAHER SUSAN N.<br>
  Abstract: As a writer who bridged the sciences and the humanities, Eiseley is a challenge for scholars locked into rigid disciplinary boundaries.
      Artifacts and Illuminations, the first full-length collection of critical essays on the writing of Eiseley, situates his work in the genres of creative nonfiction and nature writing. The contributing scholars apply a variety of critical approaches, including ecocriticism and place-oriented studies ranging across prairie, urban, and international contexts. Contributors explore such diverse topics as Eiseley's use of anthropomorphism and Jungian concepts and examine how his work was informed by synecdoche. Long overdue, this collection demonstrates Eiseley's continuing relevance as both a skilled literary craftsman and a profound thinker about the human place in the natural world.<br>

As texts, some named places are interconnected, while others are more independent (on related Pueblo geographic sensibilities, see, e.g., Harrington 1916; Ortiz 1969, 1972; Silko 1999). Some texts are sociological, others historical, some mythological, others political, economic, religious, or ecological (cf. Thornton 2008 on Tlingit place-names).

         Notes from the Leningrad Blockadeand for influential critical studies, such asOn Psychological Prose, investigating the problem of literary character in French and Russian novels and memoirs. Yet she viewed her most vital work to be the extensive prose fragments, composed for the desk drawer, in which she analyzed herself and other members of the Russian intelligentsia through seven traumatic decades of Soviet history. In this book, the first full-length English-language study of the writer, Emily Van Buskirk presents Ginzburg as a figure of previously unrecognized innovation and importance in the literary landscape of the twentieth century.<br>

Ce changement de vision ne s’est fait que très récemment. Après trente ans de messages de société, de campagnes de sensibilisation, de dépliants, la violence conjugale est devenue inacceptable, criminalisée et politisée, contrairement à la violence conjugale chez les lesbiennes, qui, elle, est demeurée occultée par les femmes et en particulier par les lesbiennes.

Après vingt-cinq années à développer une communauté excentrée et à exploiter les mines de fer environnantes, les habitants de Gagnon sont alors forcés de quitter les lieux, et les bâtiments de leur ville sont enfouis sous terre.

  Abstract: When asked about the victory against Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington is said to have replied, “The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.” It was the habits and dispositions that the officers and soldiers of the British army learned in boarding school that enabled Great Britain to prevail in the encounter. Samuel Wells contends that Eton and Waterloo exemplify two distinct aspects of ethical thought and behavior, the first the long period of preparation, the second “the tiny episode of implementation—the moment of decision, or ‘situation.’” Of the two, says Wells, the<br>

  Abstract: The central idea for this volume on the seminal
                  Royal Commentaries of the IncasandGeneral History of Peru(1609) by Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539–1616) is to bring together, in a single volume in English, key essays authored by some of the most distinguished students of Inca Garcilaso’s work. Thus far, most of the book-length scholarship on Inca Garcilaso’s work has been published in Spanish, with the notable exception of John Grier Varner’sEl Inca: The Life and Times of Garcilaso de la Vega(1968) and Margarita Zamora’sLanguage, Authority, and Indigenous History in the Comentarios reales<br>

  Book Title: Assia Djebar-Out of Algeria<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Assia Djebar, former Silver Chair of French at New York University and winner of the Neustadt Prize for Contribution to World Literature, used the tools of poetry, fiction, drama and film to vividly portray the world of Muslim women in all its complexity. In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In
      Assia Djebar, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,Assia Djebarwill be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.<br>

  Book Title: Patrick Modiano-Second Edition<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: Conceived as a second edition to Kawakami's acclaimed A Self-Conscious Art, which was the first full-length study in English of Patrick Modiano’s work, this book has been comprehensively updated with two new chapters, notably discussing the author's recent work and his Nobel Prize win. Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Author(s): Lee Jonathan Scott<br>
  Abstract: Over the past twenty years, however, new scholarly research has uncovered other contributions to the discipline now generally known as "Africana philosophy" that were not included in the original volume. In this revised and expanded edition, Hord and Lee build on the strengths of the earlier anthology while enriching the selection of readings to bring the text into the twenty-first century. In a new introduction, the editors reflect on the key arguments of the book's central thesis, refining them in light of more recent philosophical discourse. This edition includes important new readings by Kwame Gyekye, Oyèrónké Oy˘ewùmí, Paget Henry, Sylvia Wynter, Toni Morrison, Charles Mills, and Tommy Curry, as well as extensive suggestions for further reading.<br>

Data, whether text, image, or sound, moves so rapidly and transparently that we rarely consider the energizing of networks, the fueling of cultures.

  Author(s) de Sousa Cécile Vilvandre<br>
  Abstract: Né en 1956 en Roumanie, Matéi Visniec est historien et philosophe de formation. Sa passion pour les lettres l’amène très tôt à découvrir un espace de liberté dans la littérature.

Nine months earlier on 11 September, Al Qaeda operatives had rammed a passenger jet plane into the north tower of New York’s World Trade Center at 8:45 A.M. and a second airplane into the south tower eighteen minutes later. At 9:40 A.M. a third plane crashed into the Pentagon Building in Washington D.C.; a fourth plane—Flight 93—later crash-landed at Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

  1  Introducing African American Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqtsd">Insights from African American Interpretation</a><br>
  Abstract: Biblical interpretation is political. And as African Americans well know, biblical interpretation has always been political. The political is inherently hierarchal, in that some people are considered as superior to others who are constructed as inferior and subordinated. The political is concerned with the control of and access to resources, knowledge, and power. The power attributed to the Bible is profoundly demonstrated in the 2010 American postapocalyptic film
                  The Book of Eli. Denzel Washington’s character, Eli, has in his possession a powerful, sought-after book that his adversary and local warlord, Carnegie (played by Gary Oldman), will stop at nothing to<br>

  5  Psalm 78: from:

  Abstract: Psalm 78 is the longest, by far, of the so-called historical psalms (cf. Psalms 105, 106, 135, 136), and the second longest of all the psalms (cf. Psalm 119). Psalm 78 is also the core of the Asaphite mnemohistory, the heart of what Asaph remembers, not only in terms of its relative length and scope and its physical location in the midst of the collection, but in terms of its relative date and influence.¹<br>

  Abstract: Mnemohistory in the Psalms of Asaph is not uniform in its appearance or application. There is no single pattern or formula for what is recalled, how it is recalled, or how its recollection will function within a given psalm. There is a range of length and detail that the remembered past exhibits in the Asaphite Psalms, and it would be overreaching<br>

Following Roger’s name, they indicate that he “was at work on a book-length study of the fiction of urban poverty in late-Victorian England before his untimely death on October 5, 1991.” Thanks to Professor Daniel Bivona of Arizona State University,

  Abstract: Formal Javanese encounter is remarkable. Among people who are not close kin or longtime associates, and to an extent even among them, face-to-face encounter requires that everyone take great care to behave in a manner appropriate to his or her relative social status, no matter what the business at hand. Vocabulary, sentiment, gesture, timing—all must be adjusted carefully in view of the responses they are liable to arouse among the people present, and in view of one’s own social status relative to theirs. Such issues matter in encounter everywhere, certainly, but in Java the degree to which they have<br>

For obvious reasons, one hesitates to assert that such a model could possibly exist, but it is valuable nonetheless to turn with some skepticism, but a good deal of admiration, to one of the most influential attempts to prove that myth has some kind of discernible structure. This will give us an opportunity to examine in more detail the relationship of the structural model to mythicity.

  Book Title: Literary visions of multicultural Ireland-The immigrant in contemporary Irish literature<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Villar-Argáiz Pilar<br>
  Abstract: The first full-length monograph to address the impact that Celtic-Tiger immigration has exerted on the poetry, drama and fiction of contemporary Irish writersNow available in paperback, this pioneering collection of essays deals with the topic of how Irish literature responds to the presence of non-Irish immigrants in Celtic-Tiger and post-Celtic-Tiger Ireland. The book assembles an international group of 18 leading and prestigious academics in the field of Irish studies from both sides of the Atlantic, including Declan Kiberd, Anne Fogarty and Maureen T. Reddy, amongst others. Key areas of discussion are: what does it mean to be ‘multicultural’ and what are the implications of this condition for contemporary Irish writers? How has literature in Ireland responded to inward migration? Have Irish writers reflected in their work (either explicitly or implicitly) the existence of migrant communities in Ireland? If so, are elements of Irish traditional culture and community maintained or transformed? What is the social and political efficacy of these intercultural artistic visions?<br>

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

  Author(s) Caws Mary Ann<br>
  Abstract: We know that Herman Melville left only about 300 letters and that Henry James left about 12,000. Henri Peyre left a number somewhere in between. It is not, however, the number of letters that matters to the life of the writer, to the recipients, or to those who read them later. In the case of Henri Peyre, it is the extraordinary range of friends, colleagues, students, and well-known personalities with whom he corresponded, often at length. Henri Peyre was, along with all his other matchless qualities, a most beloved friend of an impressive number of impressive persons. He represented the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Thinking of history as travelling along a line, rather than round in a completed circle, is an alternative way of interpreting the experience of time. The seasons go round; but each spring is a new one, not an old spring revived. Life is viewed as a journey from youth to old age, which is halted only at the ‘journey’s end’ by death. ‘An individual is a four-dimensional object of greatly elongated form. In ordinary language, we say that he [or she] has considerable extension in time and insignificant extension in space,’ explained physicist Arthur Eddington kindly. Not all, of course,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nph7v">Simplexity</a><br>
  Abstract: A remarkable property of the nervous system is its ability to encode continuous phenomena by pulses, that is, discrete signals. For example, the length of a muscle is encoded by a pulse frequency fired by receptors known as neuromuscular “spindles.” When the length of a muscle varies, these delicate receptors—in series with the muscle motor fibers—fire pulses whose frequency is proportional to length and velocity of the change in length. Rotation of the head is encoded by variations in the firing frequency of sensory cells in the vestibular organs of the inner ear that detect acceleration. Frequency coding<br>

  Abstract: In this lecture we confront one of the most formidable and influential figures in our reading. In the years preceding and since his recent death (2004), Jacques Derrida has enjoyed a second vogue on the strength of having turned to ethical and political issues. He never repudiated his earlier thinking or his notoriously involuted style, but he adapted these signatures to the interests of progressive humanists. Together with the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben in particular, late Derrida is associated with what’s called “the ethical turn” in theoretical approaches to literature and other matters that is very much of the current<br>

  Abstract: Husserl seizes the opportunity of his inauguration as professor to present his philosophy—transcendental phenomenology, its method and its field of research—to the audience, his colleagues in Freiburg, who are not familiar with his newly developed mode of thinking.¹ Beginning with a quick reference to the revolutionary changes that have been taking place in the spiritual life of humankind, the dissolution of norms that previously were regarded as unchangeable, Husserl brings them all under the concept of “dissatisfied reason” (“die unbefriedigte Vernunft”). Even philosophy exhibits such a change. The well-established styles of doing philosophy were in flux. It is<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

  Abstract: Last night i watched—mesmerized, despite its near three-hour length—Andrei Tarkovsky’s film
                     Stalker, a minimalist science fiction epic set in a dreary, bombed-out industrial wasteland. The title does not derive from the contemporary connotation of the sexual predator, but goes back to the sort of guide who leads hunters to where game can be found. In fact, the script deliberately associates its stalker with the James Fenimore Cooper character Natty Bumppo, who is known as “Deerstalker.”<br>

  Abstract: Most educated people, in addition to a set of favorite authors, artists, and composers, develop a fascination for one or more historic cultures: republican Rome, say, or colonial New England or the Ming dynasty. Sometimes these passions are matters of aesthetic or intellectual taste, but often they bear a relationship to the individual’s ideas about what constitutes the good life and how the ideals of a past culture might nurture and strengthen one’s own. Of course, the prevailing world view of a given time period may play a role in guiding what the majority find engaging. After several centuries of<br>

  Book Title: Faces of Displacement-The Writings of Volodymyr Vynnychenko<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

  Author(s): Fuentes Juan Luis<br>
  Abstract: El último informe sobre la educación editado por la UNESCO en 2015 se titula Replantear la educación y comienza señalando la necesidad de oponerse al discurso dominante del desarrollo" al abordar la cuestión de los objetivos y las finalidades de la educación.Naturalmente no se trata de descalificar el esfuerzo por aumentar los recursos económicos de la sociedad, que eviten que la dignidad humana quede oscurecida por la falta de medios. De lo que se trata, precisamente, es de proporcionar a la dignidad los medios que necesita para llevar a plenitud el más profundo desarrollo de todas sus capacidades. Esto exige –a menos que usemos de modo vacío y estéril las palabras− conocer qué significa la dignidad humana y cuáles son las capacidades básicas de la persona que debemos promover. Ello permitirá conocer las características concretas que haya de tener una sociedad preocupada por el verdadero bien común y las grandes líneas que deben caracterizar a los sistemas educativos para colaborar en la gran tarea de una educación realmente plenificante.La Filosofía de la Educación debe estudiar estas cuestiones tratándolas desde el razonamiento público, en el respeto a las libertades y a las diversas particularidades de todas las personas.Tal es el objetivo de este libro, donde se agrupan trabajos originales de veintidós autores que, desde cuatro países distintos y trabajando en doce universidades diversas, proporcionan pistas y criterios que faciliten, usando una clásica terminología de la UNESCO, aprender a vivir juntos, pero, primeramente, aprender que la dignidad humana tiene una base ética, que mueve a cultivar las capacidades propias de la inteligencia, del carácter, y de la virtud, así como a prestar una especial atención al cuidado de esas capacidades en situaciones cuando nos encontramos ante situaciones de vulnerabilidad, señalando la misión que tiene la institución universitaria en el cultivo de todo ese conjunto de capacidades.

  Abstract: El último informe sobre la educación editado por la UNESCO en 2015 se titula Replantear la educación y comienza señalando la necesidad de oponerse al discurso dominante del desarrollo" al abordar la cuestión de los objetivos y las finalidades de la educación.Naturalmente no se trata de descalificar el esfuerzo por aumentar los recursos económicos de la sociedad, que eviten que la dignidad humana quede oscurecida por la falta de medios. De lo que se trata, precisamente, es de proporcionar a la dignidad los medios que necesita para llevar a plenitud el más profundo desarrollo de todas sus capacidades. Esto exige –a menos que usemos de modo vacío y estéril las palabras− conocer qué significa la dignidad humana y cuáles son las capacidades básicas de la persona que debemos promover. Ello permitirá conocer las características concretas que haya de tener una sociedad preocupada por el verdadero bien común y las grandes líneas que deben caracterizar a los sistemas educativos para colaborar en la gran tarea de una educación realmente plenificante.La Filosofía de la Educación debe estudiar estas cuestiones tratándolas desde el razonamiento público, en el respeto a las libertades y a las diversas particularidades de todas las personas.Tal es el objetivo de este libro, donde se agrupan trabajos originales de veintidós autores que, desde cuatro países distintos y trabajando en doce universidades diversas, proporcionan pistas y criterios que faciliten, usando una clásica terminología de la UNESCO, aprender a vivir juntos, pero, primeramente, aprender que la dignidad humana tiene una base ética, que mueve a cultivar las capacidades propias de la inteligencia, del carácter, y de la virtud, así como a prestar una especial atención al cuidado de esas capacidades en situaciones cuando nos encontramos ante situaciones de vulnerabilidad, señalando la misión que tiene la institución universitaria en el cultivo de todo ese conjunto de capacidades.

  Book Title: Cather Studies, Volume 11-Willa Cather at the Modernist Crux<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Thacker Robert<br>
  Abstract: Willa Cather at the Modernist Cruxexamines Willa Cather's position in time, in aesthetics, and in the world. Born a Victorian in 1873, Cather made herself a modernist through the poems, stories, and novels she wrote and published into the twentieth century. Beginning with a prologue locating Cather's position, this volume of Cather Studies offers three sets of related essays.The first section takes up Cather's beginnings with her late nineteenth-century cultural influences. The second section explores a range of discernible direct connections with contemporary artists (Howard Pyle, Frederic Remington, and Ernest Blumenschein) and others who figured in the making of her texts. The third section focuses onThe Song of the Lark, a novel that confirms Cather's shift westward and elaborates her emergent modernism. An epilogue by the editors ofThe Selected Letters of Willa Catheraddresses how the recent availability of these letters has transformed Cather studies. Altogether, these essays detail Cather's shaping of the world of the early twentieth century and later into a singular modernism born of both inherited and newer cultural traditions.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1qv5psc">Cather Studies, Volume 11</a><br>
  Author(s) MURPHY JOSEPH C.<br>
  Abstract: In an 1882 photograph taken in Washington DC, Willa Cather, aged about nine, wears a cross on a cotton lace dress and grips a bow and arrow fully her own height (fig. 3.1). She is out-fitted for a recitation of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s
                     Song of Hiawatha(1855). At the ripe moment in her performance, Cather reportedly “would drop on one knee and shoot her arrow into the imaginary forest,” in step with Longfellow’s verse: “Then, upon one knee uprising /Hiawatha aimed an arrow” (161).¹ Having committed the lines to memory, she embodied them in pose and picture.<br>

  Abstract: Anyone hazarding a scientific reading of Willa Cather’s work might take warning from her scorn for her former professor Lucius Sherman at the University of Nebraska. Sherman’s
                  Analytics of Literature(1893) counted word frequency and used equations to measure sentence length and “ratios of force” (Woodress 80). In his preface, Sherman claims great success with his “objective” method in literature classes: “Those accustomed to write in a lumbering awkward fashion began to express themselves in strong, clear phrases, and with a large preponderance of simple sentences. . . .

  Author(s) Ratzlaff Richard<br>
  Abstract: The mythical theme of sexual union between heavenly beings and earthly beings, especially with humans, is found in many cultures. When these stories involve heterosexual intercourse, it is usually the offspring of such intercourse that are of interest. The narrative function of these stories of sexual union can vary widely. Often the stories are explanations for unusual physical strength, the heroic make up of one or more of the protagonists. The superhuman is explained by its genesis. in the Bible this mythical theme is barely visible.¹ When a text such as Ps 2:7, for example, states of the king that<br>

  Abstract: Contrary to the popular belief that midwifery is one of the oldest female professions, midwifery is considered a “new” profession in Canada (Shroff 11). Throughout much of the twentieth century, Canada was the only western industrial nation and one of only nine of the 250 World Health Organization member countries without legal provisions for midwifery (Barrington 14-5). While the majority of babies around the world are born into the hands of midwives, the modern Canadian maternity care system was built on the model of a doctor-nurse team without the presence of the midwife as an expert in normal birth (Biggs,<br>

  Abstract: After Virgil and Ovid, the poetry of love begins to fade into the background of the literary scene.

  Author(s) Gadd David<br>
  Abstract: After a lengthy period of neglect within criminology, the study of men’s violence towards female partners gained a high profile during the 1980s as a consequence of feminist activism and feminist research with victims and survivors. Attention was drawn to the pervasive and extensive nature of violence against women, the greater danger posed by men that women know (as opposed to male strangers), the continuous relationship between physical and sexual assaults and emotional abuse, and the criminal, sometimes fatal, consequences of this abuse (Dobash and Dobash, 1980; Kelly, 1988; Hester et al, 1995).

  Book Title: Dynastic Crisis and Cultural Innovation-From the Late Ming to the Late Qing and Beyond<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Wei Shang<br>
  Abstract: This volume addresses cultural and literary transformation in the late Ming (1550–1644) and late Qing (1851–1911) eras. Although conventionally associated with a devastating sociopolitical crisis, each of these periods was also a time when Chinese culture was rejuvenated. Focusing on the twin themes of crisis and innovation, the seventeen chapters in this book aim to illuminate the late Ming and late Qing as eras of literary-cultural innovation during periods of imperial disintegration; to analyze linkages between the two periods and the radical heritage they bequeathed to the modern imagination; and to rethink the “premodernity" of the late Ming and late Qing in the context of the end of the age of modernism. The chapters touch on a remarkably wide spectrum of works, some never before discussed in English, such as poetry, drama, full-length novels, short stories, tanci narratives, newspaper articles, miscellanies, sketches, familiar essays, and public and private historical accounts. More important, they intersect on issues ranging from testimony about dynastic decline to the negotiation of authorial subjectivity, from the introduction of cultural technology to the renewal of literary convention.<br>

  Author(s): LAMERIS BREGT<br>
  Abstract: Rich in detail, this is a study of the interrelationships between film historical discourse and archival practices. Exploring the history of several important collections from the EYE Film Museum in Amsterdam, Bregt Lameris shows how archival films and collections always carry the historical traces of selection policies, restoration philosophies, and exhibition strategies. The result is a compelling argument that film archives can never be viewed simply as innocent or neutral sources of film history.<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur explains in

The decisions made by archivists on what should and should not be included in a collection are the first step in the process of interpreting historical facts; all the succeeding choices the historian makes depend on the composition and structure of the archive. As a consequence, the archive is not only the ‘starting point’ of historical research, it is also part of the historiographical discourse.¹ Furthermore, the act of collecting documents and objects always implies a change in<br>

  Book Title: Der russische Symbolismus-System und Entfaltung der poetischen Motive, Band 3 Mythopoetischer Symbolismus 2. Lebensmotive<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): HANSEN-LÖVE AAGE A.<br>
  Abstract: Der lange erwartete dritte Band der Gesamtdarstellung der mythopoetischen Motive des russischen Symbolismus schließt nach der Analyse des Frühsymbolismus der 90er Jahre des 19. Jahrhunderts (Band 1, Wien 1989) jene der kosmischen Symbolik des religionsphilosophischen Symbolismus 1900–1907 ab (Band 2, Wien 1998). Der vorliegende Band widmet sich der Lebenssymbolik jener Kernphase des Symbolismus – also den "Neomythen“ von Apoll, Dionysos und Sophia ebenso wie den Diskursen des Erhabenen, der Apokalyptik und der "Lebens-Kunst“ als Gesamtkunstwerk der Dichterexistenz des Mythopoeten. Im Mittelpunkt steht das lyrische wie essayistische Werk von Andrej Belyj, Aleksandr Blok, Vjaceslav Ivanov, Maksimilian Vološin und anderer Vertreter der zweiten Symbolistengeneration um 1900. Wie in den bisherigen Bänden wird eine systematische Präsentation der mytho- und metapoetischen Hauptmotive der Epoche angeboten und darüber hinaus eine Zusammenschau der theoretischen Schriften ihrer Protagonisten. Gegenläufig zur Konstruktion der religionskünstlerischen Symbolik wird deren allmähliche Dekonstruktion erkennbar – ein Prozess der Symbolauflösung, der auch radikale Auswirkungen auf die Konstruktion des Lebensmythos dieser Künstlergeneration hatte. Letztlich wird schrittweise erkennbar, wie das ursprünglich optimistische, positive Konzept eines Neomythologismus in dessen grotesk-karnevaleske Ironisierung umkippt. Das Modell einer revolutionären Religionskunst scheitert, die Dichtung der russischen Symbolisten jener Jahre trägt den Sieg davon. Wie die beiden vorherigen Bände versteht sich auch Band 3 als Katalog und Wegweiser zugleich, der alle wesentlichen lyrischen Primärtexte erfasst und über einen ausführlichen deutschen wie russischen Index zugänglich macht.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vw0qr1">Der russische Symbolismus</a><br>
  Abstract: Die Polarisierung des Apollinischen und Dionysischen kündigte sich schon in der deutschen Romantik (im romantischen Neomythologismus F. Schlegels, Novalis und v.a. dann in der "Mythologie" Schellings)¹ an, wobei das Apollinische mit dem "Klassischen" mit Rationalismus, Aufklärung, Humanismus identifiziert wurde, wogegen das Dionysische dem Archaisch-Mythischen, Naturhaft-Organischen, Kollektiv-Unbewußten und "Volkshaften" – im Geiste der Romantik – gleichgesetzt wurde. Diese pro-dionysische Einstellung² findet sich dann wieder in Nietzsches Gegenüberstellung von Apoll und Dionysos (in seiner "Geburt der Tragödie"),³ deren Einfluss auf die russische Moderne (insbesondere aber auf die symbolistische Mythopoetik und Religionsphilosophie) nur als total bezeichnet werden kann.<br>

  Author(s) Nitschke Claudia<br>
  Abstract: Systematic narratological classification helps identify ‘trans-historical’ phenomena which share defining characteristics, but can still change over time in terms of form or function. In the eighteenth century, seminal, longterm social and political shifts (even before the French Revolution) became widely tangible. With society undergoing massive structural changes, literature formed no exception: writers began taking stock and started rigorously to probe and investigate the semantic potential of emergent genres such as the novel, but also the narrative medium itself.<br>

Heaven, we now understand, is both the general sacred living space of the Gods and an actual sanctuary on a mountaintop near Yuta Tnoho. The seven caves (Chicomoztoc) are a metaphor for earthly origin. At the same time, they may refer to actual caves in the area with ceremonial functions. In this case, a pair emerges: Lady 3 Flint ‘Shell Quechquemitl, Plumed Serpent’ (“Power and Strength of the Plumed<br>

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remained in the USA.<br>

  Abstract: Über die österreichische Emigration nach Kanada während des Nationalsozialismus liegen bislang nur fragmentarische Erkenntnisse vor; eine systematische Erforschung des österreichischen Exils in Kanada ist noch ausständig. Die Thematik ist ein Desiderat der Exilforschung, wobei dieser Befund generell auf die Erforschung der Geschichte des deutschsprachigen Exils in Kanada zutrifft. Die unzureichende historische Aufarbeitung ist verschiedenen Faktoren geschuldet, unter anderem auch dem Umstand, dass Kanada im Vergleich zu den klassischen Zufluchtsländern (v.a. Großbritannien, Palästina, Vereinigte Staaten) eine nur verschwindend geringe Zahl an Flüchtlingen aus dem nationalsozialistischen Deutschland – nur wenige Tausend – aufnahm und somit auch nicht im zentralen Fokus der Exilforschung<br>

Vordergründig geht es dabei zwar

  Abstract: Norbert Elias war ein deutscher Soziologe aus jüdischer Familie, der 1933 emigrierte – nicht wie so viele andere in die Länder jenseits des Atlantik, sondern „nur“ über den Ärmelkanal – und nach drei Jahrzehnten zurückkam, allerdings nicht im Sinne eines Wiedereintauchens in das Land seiner Wurzeln. Sowohl der Weg ins Exil als auch die Rückkehr verliefen auf zögerliche Weise, in Etappen. Der gebürtige Schlesier, den eine vielversprechende Universitätslaufbahn von Breslau nach Heidelberg und Frankfurt am Main geführt hatte, begann sein von mühsamem Überlebenskampf und Frustrationen geprägtes Exilleben in Paris, um sich nach zwei Jahren, 1935, in London niederzulassen, wo er<br>

                  L298) as the death tolls of the battlegrounds repeatedly reached the gates of her Amherst family home. “War feels to me an oblique place,” she wrote in February 1863 to Thomas Wentworth Higginson (L280).<br>

  Abstract: The sketch entitled “An Anecdote from a Child’s Life” (“Anekdot iz detskoi zhizni”) constitutes the first section of chapter 2 of the December 1876 issue of
                  Diary of a Writer(Dnevnik pisatelia).² In length it is about 2,000 words. The story centers on a twelve-year-old girl who decides not to come home after school and to spend the night in St. Petersburg. Its focus is the psychology of a preadolescent girl at the moment of passage from innocence to a “knowledge of good and evil” and the predatory world this girl faces in the dark Petersburg night.

  Abstract: So far, the argument against the autonomy project or, more specifically, the religion-within-the-limits-of-reason-alone project has proceeded in two stages, unequal in length. First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge.

  Book Title: The Spirits of Crossbones Graveyard-Time, Ritual, and Sexual Commerce in London<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hausner Sondra L.<br>
  Abstract: Every month, a ragtag group of Londoners gather in the site known as Crossbones Graveyard to commemorate the souls of medieval prostitutes believed to be buried there-the "Winchester Geese," women who were under the protection of the Church but denied Christian burial. In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

  Abstract: ON JANUARY 19, 1919, Vaslav Nijinsky, the Polish-Russian internationally acclaimed dancer, gave a solo recital for about two hundred people at the Suvretta House Hotel in St. Moritz, Switzerland. His wife, Romola, recalls how Nijinsky came out in plain practice clothes, picked up a chair, and sat down in front of the audience. The audience waited, ill at ease but full of expectation, while Nijinsky sat perfectly still. Everyone waited like this for about half an hour. Eventually Nijinsky took out a few rolls of black and white velvet cloth and made a big cross the length of the room.<br>

But as useful as such particular concepts may be, and as interesting as the reasoning processes that produce them may be, in this chapter I focus on the broader topic of how the external senses shape our relationship with the world, including our relationship with music.<br>

Cette pensée ouvre la possibilité d’entreprendre, à partir de la perspective architecturale, une analyse critique du paradigme moderne. La notion de la représentation au centre d’un tel discours renoue avec le symbolique en tant que sens permanent de l’architecture; elle révèle également la profondeur des processus engagés dans le questionnement des modes de représentation de l’espace à travers l’histoire.

  Abstract: In addition, he includes lengthy chapters on three areas not covered in the first book. First, he explores the role of the narrator, both verbal and visual, and the particular issues that arise out of narration in autobiographical comics. Second, Groensteen tackles the question of rhythm in comics, and the skill demonstrated by virtuoso artists in intertwining different rhythms over and above the basic beat provided by the discontinuity of the panels. And third he resets the relationship of comics to contemporary art, conditioned by cultural history and aesthetic traditions but evolving recently as comics artists move onto avant-garde terrain.<br>

They involve necessary dispositions for Christian maturity in the face of adversity. These infused virtues should not be confused with the acquired virtues of the same names or resistant resilience (chapter 6), even though they can strengthen already existing acquired virtues. Furthermore, the theological virtue of hope, the gift of knowledge, the fruit of patience, and the beatitude of mourners all constitute a Christian type of patience and perseverance.

  Abstract: Like a great oak tree that has colonized a grove by driving roots deep into subterranean springs not reached by lesser trees, Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit has dominated the twentieth century by feeding off traditions that lesser philosophical works cannot access. Not only a forgotten Aristotle, but also Martin Luther, Duns Scotus, medieval mysticism, and early Christianity are connected in numerous hidden ways to this massive monument to modern angst. These roots are buried deep beneath the surface of Sein und Zeit’s transcendental phenomenological discourse, but they are the source of the book’s strength.

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along democratic lines. Committed to a political renewal, Bronner urges the American people to recall what is best about their national heritage and the genuine beacon of hope it might offer other countries and other cultures.<br>

  Abstract: In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the day on which the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington were attacked by Islamic terrorists, commentators from virtually every media outlet concurred in the belief that “everything has changed.” Few doubted that this event had ripped the fabric of history. Many suggested that the post–September 11 world would prove less innocent, more serious, and more reflective and that significant changes would mark the economic, political, and cultural life of the United States. Insofar as 9/11 created the belief that America was vulnerable to outside attack, that<br>

  Abstract: Set near the Pacific Ocean in a heavily forested, frequently overcast corner of Washington State that is alternatively rain-soaked and muddy or snow-covered and cold, Robert Altman’s
                  McCabe and Mrs. Miller(1971) is not a classic western in the way that, say, John Ford’sMy Darling Clementine(1946) and George Stevens’sShane(1953) are classic. The setting is a first clear indication thatMcCabe and Mrs. Millerdiffers from classic westerns.

  Reservoir Dogs: from:

  Author(s) Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Reservoir Dogs(1992),Pulp Fiction(1994), andKill Bill(both volumes: 2003, 2004) are arguably the most successful (and I would say important) of the four full-length feature films that Quentin Tarantino has directed. And each is more or less explicitly about redemption.¹ Further, Tarantino is widely recognized as a quintessentially postmodern neo-noir filmmaker.² His films are postmodern in the artistic sense, insofar as they are, for example, blends of genres and highly allusive. But they’re also postmodern in terms of the underlying epistemology and the position on morality and values that they take. That is, they reflect a postmodern<br>

  Abstract: On October 16, 1995, a million black men marched on Washington, D.C.,¹ answering Louis Farrakhan’s call for reconciliation and atonement.² Not since the 1963 march for civil rights had so many Americans descended on Capitol Hill. Although the mainstream contemporary historical narrative suggests otherwise, Martin Luther King Jr., like Farrakhan, was a controversial figure in his time. Nevertheless, in spite of the varied perspectives within the African American community about Farrakhan’s beliefs and methods,³ his call to action was answered by thousands of African American men across the country.<br>

  Abstract: Shortly after the release of

But, upon deeper inspection, she is also revealed to be a rather superficial woman who embodies problematic gender stereotypes, has very few female friends, and is ultimately punished<br>

  Abstract: New cooperative approaches to the management of marine resources are imperative in the delivery of sustainable incomes and livelihoods in the South Pacific. While recent international agreements have strengthened the sovereignty of states over their adjacent ocean resources, the actual development and implementation of management regimes for tuna, arguably the region’s most important renewable resource in terms of income-generating potential, will require a much more concerted approach by Pacific island states. This will need to be matched by a willingness on the part of the non-coastal states that traditionally harvest the bulk of the region’s oceanic resources to cooperate in<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Contexts for Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt78n">Overcoming Our Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: I argued in chapter 1 that if one’s goal is to engage culturally distant thinkers precisely as thinkers, as theorists who have developed religious conceptions worthy of careful study, then the best comparative strategy is to interpret them with sensitivity, alert to the various contexts and traditions in which they moved and worked. This is not particularly controversial, but neither is it obvious what this implies. Proper contextualization of interpretations does not require a lengthy account of “the context” that would duplicate or mimic specialist histories; it is rather a matter of perceptive interpretation of particular points in each thinker,<br>

  Abstract: John Sweeney, the leader of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), led a revolt of a gaggle of large unions and was elected American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) president in 1995, an unprecedented challenge in modern labor history to a sitting administration.

The focus of this seminar on Christian and Muslim approaches to the relationship between tradition and modernity was a natural continuation of discussions at earlier Building Bridges seminars, notably on the interface between science and religion in 2009. Following an established pattern, after an opening day of public lectures, the second and third days were spent in private sessions discussing<br>

Perhaps the most philosophical attitude we can take to these trials and tribulations appears in aphorisms such as “What doesn’t kill me strengthens me” and “What evil there is must be for some greater good” – sayings that depict our resignation to the unchanging nature of some things in life and our need to somehow manage.

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Abstract: I want to evaluate the five visions of hermeneutic analysis primarily in terms of the argument from patient rejection; each vision may have additional weaknesses and strengths that I do not discuss. The story model is most vulnerable to the argument, and I devote the most attention to it. The other versions of hermeneutic psychoanalysis are less vulnerable to the argument or possibly vulnerable to it only in a different form.¹ Thus, in the course of discussing the models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, I identify a strong and a weak version of the argument from patient rejection.

  Abstract: Every psychoanalyst of some clinical experience is aware of apparently unpromising analytic situations that turned out well and of analyses that began favorably but ended badly. Often, with benefit of hindsight, it is possible to identify sources of strength or weakness that were not recognized at the outset. Examples of such situations include barely mentioned but psychologically lifesaving relationships in the patient’s early childhood, or disturbances of thinking not manifest in the initial consultation. The analyst’s particular unresolved conflicts that lead to countertransference interferences may impede the ability to work with otherwise promising patients. Sometimes the reasons for unexpected outcomes<br>

Both aspects can be understood as responses to the same social phenomenon—miraculous economic growth alongside political suppression, or what has often been referred to as “the tyranny of development.” The majority of Korean churches have supported the side of “development,” strengthening the significance of economic success with their Christian teachings of blessings, while a<br>

They owed their strength to political concerns and pragmatic effects, and served as tropes in the lives of staff and residents alike. Paul Rabinow notes that sociologies of scientific practices “have sought (with some success) to lower-case the abstractions of Science, Reason, Truth and Society.”¹ Reflections on a commonplace but perhaps less well understood kind of reasoning—reasoning that takes form in everyday life—might enable us to similarly lower-case reason, intimate its cultural and political features, and<br>

  Abstract: Childhood studies scholarship has revealed that childhood, the category that holds, defines, and governs children, is to be a social construct contingent on time and place.¹ While young children are, generally speaking, vulnerable and dependent, the length, contours, and extent of that dependency, as well as the assignment of children to dependency, vary greatly across time, nation, geography, and race.² This central insight, that childhood is not natural, has yet to gain currency in legal studies.

  Abstract: At the 1916 lynching of Jesse Washington in Waco, Texas, one father, when questioned about the propriety of holding his young son on his shoulder so he could get a good view of the mob that kicked, stabbed, castrated, and incinerated Washington, replied: “My son can’t learn too young the proper way to treat a nigger.”¹ Between 1877 and 1939, similar events occurred repeatedly across the South, and, as this example—a white man with his son—suggests, the social hierarchy of the New South rested upon a foundation of race and gender. Concerns about the future of white supremacy<br>

  Author(s) Barbee Matthew Mace<br>
  Abstract: On 6 February 1993, Arthur Ashe died due to complications from HIV/AIDS. The tennis champion, activist, writer, and Richmond, Virginia, native was forty-nine years old. National newspapers reported his passing with pronounced mourning and loss. Along with a standard obituary, the 
                  Washington Post recalled Ashe in an editorial as “a legendary figure in modern American history.” The Post’s Tony Kornheiser lauded Ashe as “my hero. He was a man of grace, of intellect, of moral purpose, of courage and integrity.” Kornheiser’s fellow sports columnist Michael Wilbon wrote that “nobody brought more dignity or honor than Arthur Ashe” and defined his<br>

  Teaching Bioregional Perception—at a Distance from:

  Abstract: At 1,919 feet it’s not much of a mountain, even by northern Taconic standards, but still people climb through the hickory, beech, and maple to take in the view from Haystack Mountain: Adirondacks to the west, Green Mountains to the east, and the basin of Lake Champlain opening to the north. There’s nothing visible to suggest where a mapmaker’s line separates Vermont from New York, or Rutland County from Bennington and Washington Counties—never mind the fainter lines between the towns of Pawlet, Granville, Rupert, or Danby.

  24  Differance from:

  Author(s) Derrida Jacques<br>
  Abstract: The verb “to differ” [
                     différer] seems to differ from itself. On the one hand, it indicates difference as distinction, inequality, or discernibility; on the other, it expresses the interposition of delay, the interval of aspacingandtemporalizingthat puts off until “later” what is presently denied, the possible that is presently impossible. Sometimes thedifferentand sometimes thedeferredcorrespond [in French] to the verb “to differ.” This correlation, however, is not simply one between act and object, cause and effect, or primordial and derived.<br>

  Book Title: A Self-Conscious Art-Patrick Modiano’s Postmodern Fictions<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Abstract: Modiano’s novels are full of dates. The narrators seem to take much pleasure in specifying precisely when certain events took place, whether in their own lives or in someone else’s. Chapters and paragraphs frequently start with a date reference: ‘Hier, 1er octobre de dix-neuf cent quatre-vingt quatorze, je suis revenu chez moi, de la place d’Italie, par le mètro.’¹ Or: ‘J’ai connu Francis Jansen quand j’avais dix-neuf ans, au printemps de 1964 . . .’² These are especially useful given that Modiano’s novels all deal with explorations into the past, various levels of the past, made accessible through long flashbacks.<br>

  9  “Risking Sensuality”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjbrv">Black Intersectionalities</a><br>
  Author(s) Raynaud Claudine<br>
  Abstract: While past scholarship has explored at great length the inscription of the black body in Morrison’s work, recent analysis has focused on her “use of the erotic” – to take up Audre Lorde’s phrase (Turpin, 2010) – in an effort to locate her specific work with language in comparison and contrast with Audre Lorde and Dionne Brand. I wish to argue in this chapter that writing the erotic is what Morrison has been “risking” throughout her output since
                  Sula(1973) throughBeloved(1987) andJazz(1992), down toA Mercy(2008). The erotic is not a “theme,” a moment in the novels’<br>

                  Inferno, Brian Merriman’sThe Midnight Court, and the Old Irish epic,The Táin, attest – but also as a theme or trope that relates to the multifarious effects of language itself. In this regard ‘translation’ concerns itself with the ways in which transactions between words, idioms, discourses, and languages reveal the difference that is internal to all language. Or, as Walter Benjamin expresses it, ‘all translation is only a somewhat provisional way of coming to terms<br>

  Author(s) HAMMOND BREAN S.<br>
  Abstract: Post-Romantic conceptions of originality make it difficult for us to regard as other than paradoxical the claim that ‘An Allusion to Horace’, the poem in which Rochester is most indebted to a precursor, is also one of his most original contributions to English poetry. If Rochester was not quite the first English poet to press a Roman satire into the service of his own times, he was the first to appreciate that this could be done systematically over the length of an entire poem, to wit Horace’s
                  Satire1.10.¹ Doubtless, Rochester did not intuit the full potential of this new<br>

  Author(s) Bhambra Gurminder K.<br>
  Abstract: The colonial encounter has been a defining moment in the making of the contemporary world. It has
                  madea particular world and established cognitive patterns forknowingthe world, yet the colonial encounter is missing in most sociological accounts of modernity. In recent times, increasing significance has been given to global phenomena. Acknowledging the complexity brought by globalization and interdependence has led theorists to contend that a new approach to modernity is needed. A shift from the singular trajectory of modernity to multiple modernities has been recommended (Arnason 2000; Delanty 2004; Eisenstadt 2000, 2001, 2004; Eisenstadt and Schluchter 1998; Wittrock<br>

  The Inventory Room Is Sepulchral from:

  Abstract: The inventory room is sepulchral. Someone decided that central heating wasn’t needed here, so cold damp air is continually drifting down from the high ceilings.

  CHAPTER 7  Secularism, sociology and security from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp7qd">Secularism, Assimilation and the Crisis of Multiculturalism</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter first examines the Stasi report (2003), which imparted to the French government the crucial recommendation to issue a law prohibiting the wearing of conspicuous religious signs in public schools. The report provides a lengthy analysis of the actuality of
                  laïcité. The final recommendation about the conspicuous religious signs forms only a small part of this document, which redefineslaïcitéin several regards. I relate my reading of the report to the views of multiculturalists who have concentrated on secularism such as Brahm Levey and Bader, focusing especially on the report’s reiteration of the modernist dichotomies discussed in the<br>

  6  Digital Tools and the Emergence of the Social Text from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpnfx">A New Republic of Letters</a><br>
  Abstract: Like another important edition of our time, Hans Gabler’s
                  Ulysses, J. C. C. Mays’s edition on Coleridge—three volumes, each in two parts—set an inspiring example of scholarly thoroughness and integrity.¹ But the real strength of the work rests ultimately in something else—something quite rare in the scholarly editions of English-speaking authors produced in the last fifty years. Mays is deeply sympathetic to Coleridge’s poetry—not unaware of or reticent to address its failings and limitations, but fronting all the work with what Desmond McCarthy, writing of Coleridge, called “the most delicate sympathy.” “When he writes of it<br>

  CHAPTER SIX  The Function of Phenomenological Psychology for Empirical Psychology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq5mg">Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology</a><br>
  Abstract: Die phänomenologisch reine Psychologie ist das unbedingt notwendige Fundament für den Aufbau einer “exakten” empirischen Psychologie, die nach dem Vorbild der exakten rein physischen Naturwissenschaft seit deren neuzeitlichen Anfängen gesucht worden ist. Der prinzipielle Sinn der Exaktheit dieser Naturwissenschaft liegt in ihrer Fundierung auf das apriorische, in eigenen Disziplinen (reine Geometrie, reine Zeitlehre, Bewegungslehre usw.) entfaltete Formensystem einer denkmöglichen Natur überhaupt. Durch die Verwertung dieses apriorischen Formensystems fur die faktische Natur gewinnt die vage induktive Empirie Anteil an der Wesensnotwendigkeit und die empirische Naturwissenschaft selbst den neuen methodischen Sinn, für alle vagen Begriffe und Regeln die diesen notwendig zu unterlegenden<br>

Aus tiefliegenden Gründen kann sie als Vorstufe für die Freilegung des Wesens einer transzendentalen Phänomenologie dienen. Auch historisch ist diese Idee nicht aus den eigenen Bedürfnissen der Psychologie selbst erwachsen. Ihre Geschichte führt uns bis auf J.

Diese Doppelheit klärt sich durch evidente Aufweisung. Die seelische Subjektivität, das konkret gefaßte “ich” und “wir” der alltäglichen Rede, wird in ihrer reinen psychischen Eigenheit erfahren durch die Methode phänomenologisch-psychologischer Reduktion. In eidetischer Abwandlung schafft sie den Boden für die rein phänomenologische Psychologie.

Verständlich wird auch durch die gewonnene Aufklärung auf der einen Seite die Unabhängigkeit der Idee einer transzendentalen Phänomenologie und ihrer systematischen Durchführung von derjenigen einer phänomenologisch reinen Psychologie, auf der anderen Seite doch die propädeutische Nützlichkeit eines vorausgeschickten Entwurfes reiner Psychologie für ein Aufsteigen zur transzendentalen Phänomenologie, eine Nützlichkeit, die die vorliegende Darstellung geleitet hat.

  Abstract: In today’s globalized, hyper-international, post-migration times, it may seem obvious that Kipling’s claim about East and West no longer holds true. Nevertheless, the East/West split is still widely held to have relevance, not only in popular stereotypes and vague generalizations, but even in academic scholarship across a range of fields, including psychology, literature, and some areas of politics. Witness Samuel Huntington’s Clash of Civilizations theory, which posits a West under increasing threat from the “civilization” of Islam. The field of life writing has also at times been prone to make generalizations about whole swathes of humanity, suggesting that “Western” life<br>

  Abstract: The years from 1580 to 1700 witnessed an explosion of ghosts in writings for the stage. In part, this increase stemmed from a general proliferation of new plays, for this was the heyday of the southern drama(chuanqi). As the playwright Yuan Yuling (1592–1674) declared: “There’s never been such a superabundance of plays as nowadays.”¹ This surge had as much to do with the late Ming boom in publishing as with the passion of literary men for the theater. The lengthiness of southern drama play texts—thirty or forty acts was average, but fifty acts was not uncommon—meant<br>

  Abstract: The political revolution in 1989 in Eastern Europe and the dramatic events of August 1991 in Moscow did not only mark the end of the Cold War era, but also the beginning of a worldwide wave of democratization. Marc F. Platter hailed the arrival of democracy on the ruins of Leninist Socialism as “the democratic moment” and stated that “we may at last be entering a sustained period of peaceful democratic hegemony—a kind of ‘Pax Democratica’.”¹ Samuel P.

  Book Title: Out of the Margins-The Rise of Chinese Vernacular Fiction<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Ge Liangyan<br>
  Abstract: The novel Water Margin (Shuihu zhuan), China's earliest full-length narrative in vernacular prose, first appeared in print in the sixteenth century. The tale of one hundred and eight bandit heroes evolved from a long oral tradition; in its novelized form, it played a pivotal role in the rise of Chinese vernacular fiction, which flourished during the late Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) periods. Liangyan Ge's multidimensional study considers the evolution of Water Margin and the rise of vernacular fiction against the background of the vernacularization of premodern Chinese literature as a whole. This gradual and arduous process, as the book convincingly shows, was driven by sustained contact and interaction between written culture and popular orality. Ge examines the stylistic and linguistic features of the novel against those of other works of early Chinese vernacular literature (stories, in particular), revealing an accretion of features typical of different historical periods and a prolonged and cumulative process of textualization. In addition to providing a meticulous philological study, his work offers a new reading of the novel that interprets some of its salient characteristics in terms of the interplay between audience, storytellers, and men of letters associated with popular orality.<br>

                  Shuihu zhuan, Sanguo yanyi, andXiyou ji—related to the long oral tradition that preceded it? Did the popular story-cycles only provide the subject matter for the composition of the narrative, or did the oral model exert a shaping influence on the work in print on the level of narrative discourse as well? These questions are so hard to answer simply because we know so little about those popular traditions and about<br>

  Book Title: Essays from the Edge-Parerga and Paralipomena<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

He makes the case that the sources of democratic legitimacy have shifted and multiplied over the past thirty years and that we need to comprehend and make better use of these new sources of legitimacy in order to strengthen our political self-belief and commitment to democracy.<br>

  Abstract: In January 24, 1790, Gouverneur Morris, a New York citizen of the new American republic, wrote a letter to George Washington, then the president of the United States, urging him to “fix the taste” of the new country and to become a model of what we may now call the aesthetic self: “It is . . . my wish that everything about you should be substantially good and majestically plain, made to endure.”¹<br>

  7  Pluralism as a Matter of Principle from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t1pt">Christian Political Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) SKILLEN JAMES W.<br>
  Abstract: David Little builds his case for a ʺweak theoryʺ of ethical pluralism largely on the basis of what he calls ʺconscientious individualism.ʺ In response, I would like to argue that something broader and deeper than conscientious individualism is needed to account for both the diversity of ethical responsibilities that humans bear and the diverse, often incompatible ways they exercise those responsibilities. By enlarging and strengthening the normative basis, I believe it is possible to develop a strong, principled argument for pluralism, which is not the same as a defense of ethical relativism.<br>

Were it presently December in London, or William Cowper’s Olney, the sun would not rise before 8:00 a.m.; it would illuminate the sky for fewer than eight hours.

George W.

Yeats seldom missed an opportunity to promote Irish nationalism, and he quickly seized on this one, as he relates: “He told me he had learned Irish at Trinity College, so I urged him to go to the Aran Islands and find a life had never been expressed in literature, instead of a life where all been expressed.

  Book Title: Sung Dynasty Uses of the I Ching-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyatt Don J.<br>
  Abstract: The
         I Ching, or Book of Changes, has been one of the two or three most influential books in the Chinese canon. It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied theI Chingto these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of theI Ching, this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture.<br>

  Abstract: Milton read the Book of Psalms as the record of a journey through life traversing all the tempers, moods, passions, and uneven reactions that mark the psalmist’s search for an adequate faith. Such a mode of reading was common to Englishmen in his day, guided by the Geneva Bible’s representation of Psalms as a course of life by which “at length [to] atteine to [an] incorruptible crowne of glorie.”¹ Since the journey is not a consistent progress toward enlightenment, individual psalms register backsliding, fear, self-deception, even inadequacy of response no less truly than nobility of spirit.

  Abstract: In the first full-length study of Wallace Stevens's word-play, Eleanor Cook focuses on Stevens's skillful play with grammar, etymology, allusion, and other elements of poetry, and suggests ways in which this play offers a method of approaching his work. At the same time, this book is a general study of Stevens's poetry, moving from his earliest to his latest work, and includes close readings of three of his remarkable long poems--Esthetique du Mal, Notes toward a Supreme Fiction, and An Ordinary Evening in New Haven. The chronological arrangement enables readers to follow Stevens's increasing skill and changing thought in three areas of his "poetry of the earth": the poetry of place, the poetry of eros, and the poetry of belief.<br>

In this chapter I want to dwell on the central theme of Blake’s ideological affiliation to the radicals of the Commonwealth period—liberty—and especially on the tradition of Christian antinomianism. As this affiliation has not been fully discussed before, I will give it more space than his relations with contemporaries or the details of his own elaboration of the theme, both of which Erdman and others have treated at length.

  Abstract: The earliest evidence of library formation is a collection of Babylonian clay tablets from the twenty-first century B.C. But libraries have probably existed from the very moment humans began to make marks durable enough to be conserved. The fixing of significations in some durable material form made it possible for them to transcend the immediacy of experience, for them to be suspended above the flow of time in order to be revisited later, grouped and compared, reflected upon at greater length, or shared with people not immediately present. Inscription itself, of course, is not a mode of signification, but a<br>

  Chapter Seven  Eeldrop and Appleplex: from:

  Abstract: Eliot first came to visit Pound in the triangular study of his Kensington apartment in the Autumn of 1914, and Pound immediately sent “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” to Harriet Monroe, calling it “the best poem I have yet had or seen from an American” (L, 40). At the same time, Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken that he found Pound’s verse “touchingly incompetent.”¹ This opinion would change. Eliot went up to Oxford, completed his dissertation on the philosophy of F. H. Bradley, married Vivienne Haigh-Wood, suffered, moved back to London, and began working at Lloyds Bank in 1917.<br>

                  Trinity Reviewthat he liked Stevens’ poetry “so much,” we can surmise that it was not Stevens’ manner or style that occasioned his lack of interest, but rather the substance or themes of his poetry.

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: It was always the advice of my teachers never to introduce new material into the conclusion of an essay. On this occasion I will risk ignoring what I recognize is generally sound advice for two reasons. To have offered a study that has reflected at length on the relationship between revelation and the liturgy in the period of Vatican II without significant mention of Joseph Ratzinger seems clumsy, if not foolhardy.¹ Moreover, perhaps the questions and tensions that can be found in Ratzinger’s work in regard to our subject both identify the key issue clearly and also indicate avenues of<br>

  Abstract: No general hypothesis about the Lukan parables is reliable if it is based on a selective reading.¹ Therefore, after the previous deep analysis of some key parables, the next step is to create a comprehensive presentation of all Jesus’ parables in Luke.² I will do this in two interrelated parts. chapter 6 will provide a synopsis of the parables. I will examine how to identify them and their essential qualities, such as length, type, images, audience, exigency, credibility, and references. The overall results for each question and their most interesting correlations will be displayed. One specific aim of this chapter<br>

  Abstract: Israel, so many scholars claim, is a pro-natal state. But what does that mean in terms of the public imagery of pregnancy? That
                     failingto conceive is pictured as an unbearable tragedy might come as no surprise, but what about a normal healthy pregnancy? One could hypothesize that since such a pregnancy is the height of the pro-natal fantasy, then it should be depicted in the most positive of terms. How then, can one interpret the following scene in which terror is so tightly intertwined into the very fabric of the social imagery of gestation?<br>

  Abstract: In endeavoring to explain the fact that the Durkheimian religion cluster primarily wrote about primitive societies while other important members of the Durkheimian team, e.g., Maurice Halbwachs and François Simiand, concentrated on Western society, W. Paul Vogt argues that the religion cluster studied primitives in part because they had an attitude of “despair” regarding the modern world. They perceived something troubling about the contemporary situation in the West and attempted to use primitive societies as a means for pointing to what had been lost in the move to modernity (Vogt 1976: 43). According to this account, the religion cluster believed<br>

At the outset, the main line of production consisted of custom, handmade, luxurious (luksuzni) pieces of carved wood that required lengthy manufacturing time and cost a significant amount of money.

Enter the “eternally traveling Jewish train,” he asked, a plea that is not limited to wartime trains if one looks at the image of the freight car housed in the permanent exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) in Washington, DC (see Figure 4.1). The image of the freight car fuses historical space and contemporary memory practices. By looking at the platform of Auschwitz from the departure side of the rail car, the photo promises an Auschwitz arrival to the museum visitor.<br>

  Author(s) Bayerdörfer Hans-Peter<br>
  Abstract: George Tabori loves to declare himself the oldest living “royal-imperial Austro-Hungarian playwright.”¹ It took him several decades to return—at least temporarily—to the proper place for a writer of this traditional distinction: in 1968/69 he returned to Europe, first to Germany, then in the 1980s to Austria and to Vienna, and finally to the Burgtheater. As is well known, Tabori is fond of puns, calembours, and clichés in general, so it is hardly surprising that he seems to be fond of Vienna clichés in particular, choosing titles such as

In the context of a reference work, a twenty-nine page article is fairly lengthy, yet the article is minuscule in comparison to the numerous separate articles on the musicians and music associated with that city.¹ Even if we were to restrict our comments to Vienna alone, the richness and complexity of that city’s contribution to the world of music could fill a library; a book length treatment could hardly do it justice.

  Author(s) MACK ERIC<br>
  Abstract: In recent years the increased strength and assertiveness of socially conservative political movements have heightened public debate about the legitimate role of the state in enforcing moral prescriptions that are arguably the product of particular, sectarian, religious or moral perspectives. Social conservatives, motivated by components of their religious commitments, have not only condemned homosexual activity and abortion (to pick the two most prominent issues) but have also argued that these activities ought to be legally prohibited. In opposition to such proposals, there has been a reassertion of the liberal doctrines that political institutions must be neutral between competing conceptions of<br>

  Author(s) Paul Lissa<br>
  Abstract: In
                  Keywords, the term “literacy” does not have an entry of its own. Instead, Raymond Williams (1976) traces its evolution from its fourteenth-century root, “literature.” For the first three hundred years of its life, “literature” was an all-purpose word referring sometimes to “being well-read,” and at other times to “the books in which a man is well-read” (Williams 1976). Gradually, this common-ancestor word divided into several distinct species: the root-word, “literature,” strengthened its links to nationhood (as in English literature or French literature); “literate” came to describe being well-read; “literary” became associated with the “profession of authorship”; and “literacy” arose<br>

  Abstract: In his sermon entitled “Increase of Faith,” the Reverend James Stratten of Paddington Chapel identifies three avenues by which “conviction and enjoyment [are] realized in the mind.”¹ His identification of the senses as an inlet of knowledge is both Lockean and Romantic; his extended valuation of intellect is both Augustinian and Enlightenment-inflected; and his naming of faith as the third and greatest inlet of knowledge reaches as far back as the biblical proverb “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (where “fear” means reverence). Actually, not just the latter but all three “inlets of knowledge” are affirmed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh59s">Scientific Understanding</a><br>
  Author(s) LEONELLI SABINA<br>
  Abstract: This chapter offers an analysis of understanding in biology based on characteristic biological
                     practices:ways in which biologists think and act when carrying out their research. De Regt and Dieks have forcefully claimed that a philosophical study of scientific understanding should “encompass the historical variation of specific intelligibility standards employed in scientific practice” (2005, 138). In line with this suggestion, I discuss the conditions under which contemporary biologists come to understand natural phenomena and I point to a number of ways in which the performance of specific research practices informs and shapes the quality of such understanding.<br>

  Abstract: Monsters, madmen, and ghouls have always stalked the American imagination. Between the Revolution and the Civil War, headless horsemen, murdering apes, killer sharks, giant white whales, pillaging barbarians, and other evil avatars inhabited the fiction of Washington Irving, Edgar Allen Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville as well as the art of John Singleton Copley, Benjamin West, and Thomas Cole. After the Civil War, the presence of such grotesque and aberrant figures diminished. Beholden to evolutionary science, naturalism had little use for the supernatural.

  Book Title: Kathleen Jamie-Essays and Poems on Her work<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Falconer Rachel<br>
  Abstract: Kathleen Jamie's works are classics. No one can read Kathleen Jamie and remain indifferent or unchanged. Nationally acclaimed since her first major publications in the 1980s, Jamie stands out from other contemporary poets in her exceptional musicality, her strikingly unusual perspectives, her wry humour, translucent imagery, and hard-edged economy of expression. These 16 newly commissioned critical essays and 7 previously unpublished poems by leading poets make up the first full-length study of Kathleen Jamie's writing. The essays discuss all of her poetry collections, including The Queen of Sheba (1994), Jizzen (1999), Mr and Mrs Scotland Are Dead: Poems 1980-94 (2002), The Tree House (2004) and The Overhaul (2012), as well as her travel writing, including Among Muslims (2002), her nature writing, Findings (2005) and Sightlines (2012) and her collaborative work, including Frissure (2013), with artist Brigid Collins. Whether engaging with national politics, with gender, with landscape and place, or with humanity's relation to the natural environment, this volume demonstrates that Kathleen Jamie's verse teaches us new ways of listening, of seeing and of living in the contemporary world.<br>

  Abstract: The documentary field is arguably one of the most vibrant, challenging and creative areas in moving images today. In countries with well-established film and television industries, documentary production has been considerably revitalised since the late 1980s. From this period onwards, new distribution opportunities through specialised TV channels and circulation in both international film festivals and theatres have steadily ensured the vitality of both documentary TV programmes and feature-length documentaries. Simultaneously, the globalisation and popularisation of video and digital technologies around the world, and the concomitant development of video practices outside conventional cinema, have transformed the documentary form into a common<br>

At an early age, Dorothy Brett had suffered from hearing problems. It first became noticeable while she was a student at the Slade School of Art, then, as now, part of University College, London. The Provost of this prestigious institution, horrified by the fact that Brett and two friends had chosen to picnic on the hallowed lawn inside the courtyard, delivered a severe reprimand. ‘I’m sorry, I’m deaf,’ Brett replied, ‘I haven’t been able to hear a word you said.’²<br>

  Author(s) Bankston Samantha<br>
  Abstract: Before all else, we need to acknowledge a previously held, reprehensible position: for a long time Deleuze’s book on Foucault² seemed to consist of a dogmatic rigidity that did not manage to break into the enthusiasm of what Foucault said. From cover to cover the book seemed
                  ridiculousto us. It seemed far, so far from Foucault’s actual work, and with a menacing sort of passion we thought aboutdemonstratingthat in his book Deleuze had committed nothing more than a work of fiction. The reception of Deleuze’s presentation at the conference, “Michel Foucault, Philosopher,”³ only reinforced these poorly conceived<br>

  Author(s) Nail Thomas<br>
  Abstract: What is the relationship between Foucault’s concept of biopower and Deleuze’s concept of control? Despite the similarities between these two concepts, there is not a single scholarly article that solely thematizes this question, nor a comparative survey of the answers given so far. This essay aims to fill this lacuna. Despite the lack of a full-length interrogation of this question, scholars have taken up several different positions on the relationship between these two concepts. While some distinguish the two concepts based on the content of what they act on (biopower on life vs control on economics), others distinguish them based<br>

  Abstract: The phenomenon of the Scottish Enlightenment has become the focus of such a vast scholarly industry, as well as being extolled as a political and cultural icon in Scotland and in North America, that it is easy to lose sight of just how recently it was identified as a specific historical occurrence. As Charles Withers and Paul Wood pointedly remind us in

  Book Title: Post-Foundational Political Thought-Political Difference in Nancy, Lefort, Badiou and Laclau<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tynan Aidan<br>
  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  Book Title: The Modernist Party-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McLoughlin Kate<br>
  Abstract: Leading international scholars explore the party's significance to ModernismHave you ever been struck by the number of parties in Modernist literature? Mrs. Ramsay drowns in anguish at the dinner-party she gives in Woolf's To The Lighthouse. Death is a guest in Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party'. Politics sour the evening party in Joyce's 'The Dead'. Have you also noticed the role played by parties in the public intellectual culture of Modernism? A party held in London by Amy Lowell on 17 July 1914, attended by Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, H.D. and Richard Aldington, degenerated into an argument over the nature of Imagism. On 18 May 1922, Proust, Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky and Diaghilev met at a post-ballet party at Paris's Hotel Majestic: an unrepeatable encounter between Modernism's leading figures. In The Modernist Party, internationally distinguished scholars explore the party both as a literary device and as a social setting in which the movement's creative values were developed.Key Features:* Develops the concept of space, currently of central concern to Modernist scholars* Explores the tensions between Modernism as an aesthetics of intensity and Modernism as a movement of the everyday* Adds a new and vital area of research to investigations of Modernism as the product of intellectual and social networksKeywords: Modernism, Literature, Party, Social Network, Collaboration, Space<br>

  Abstract: The tenuous relationships between the disciplines of philosophy and literary theory have recently been strengthened by a development which, at least in this country and over the last fifty years, is somewhat unusual. Literary theorists never dispensed with a certain amount of philosophical readings and references, but this does not mean that there always was an active engagement between the two institutionalized academic fields. Students of philosophy, on the other hand, can legitimately and easily do without the critical investigation of literary theorists, past or present; it is certainly more important for a literary theorist to read Wittgenstein than for<br>

The most extensive reading offered is that of Rousseau, who is considered at length in an overview that includes the major fictional, political and confessional writings. In the case of Proust and of Rilke, the corpus is much less extended, although it claims to be representative of structures that recur in the work as a whole.

His departure occurs on the eve of a celebration in Dublin of the life of Charles Stewart Parnell, the fallen Irish political leader. Synge’s train is full of excursionists to Dublin, and many of them are in a festive mood. ‘A wild crowd was on the platform, surging round the train in every stage of intoxication’, writes Synge, who describes the scene as evidence of the ‘half-savage temperament of Connaught’.¹ Synge is not altogether disapproving of the<br>

  Abstract: I would first like to thank the editors for inviting me to contribute to the Millennial Reflections Project. In preparing my remarks I have had the benefit of reading the essays presented at the “Feminist Theory and Gender Studies” and “Alternative and Critical Perspectives” panels. Indeed, my remarks often build on points elaborated by my colleagues and are especially indebted to Marysia Zalewski’s essay. The latter inspired the themes and the title of my own contribution. Rather than repeat arguments already articulated,myessay focuses on identifying the strengths of feminist international relations (IR)—what renders it “cutting edge”—and considering how<br>

  Author(s) Scott Rebecca J.<br>
  Abstract: Few questions of historical interpretation are more passionately debated than those that have become intertwined with a national narrative and with the definition of how a country came to be what it is imagined to be. For the island nation of Cuba, political independence was forged in a lengthy series of wars against Spanish colonial rule, ending in a direct encounter with U.S. expansionism. Those wars began in 1868 and concluded in 1898 with the departure of Spanish troops, followed by a military occupation of the island by U.S. forces. In 1902 the first Cuban republic emerged, but it was<br>

  Abstract: In the following short radio broadcast, in which Simone de Beauvoir reflects upon her engagement with the autobiographical genre and its relation to fiction, a meta-narrative of her autobiographical project is briefly emplotted. Beauvoir echoes here certain of her “in-flight” observations on autobiography in
                     The Prime of LifeandForce of Circumstanceand anticipates the lengthier and later analyses of the roles of fiction and autobiography of her 1966 lecture, “My Experience as a Writer,” delivered in Japan.<br>

  Book Title: Storytelling in Siberia-The Olonkho Epic in a Changing World<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS ROBIN P.<br>
  Abstract: Olonkho , the epic narrative and song tradition of Siberia 's Sakha people, declined to the brink of extinction during the Soviet era. In 2005, UNESCO 's Masterpiece Proclamation sparked a resurgence of interest in olonkho by recognizing its important role in humanity 's oral and intangible heritage. Drawing on her ten years living in the Russian North, Robin P. Harris documents how the Sakha have used the Masterpiece program to revive olonkho and strengthen their cultural identity. Harris 's personal relationships with and primary research among Sakha people provide vivid insights into understanding olonkho and the attenuation, revitalization, transformation, and sustainability of the Sakha 's cultural reemergence. Interdisciplinary in scope, Storytelling in Siberia considers the nature of folklore alongside ethnomusicology, anthropology, comparative literature, and cultural studies to shed light on how marginalized peoples are revitalizing their own intangible cultural heritage.<br>

  Abstract: An oral epic tradition composed of alternating sections of narrative poetry and song, olonkho demonstrates many of the characteristics common to other epic narrative traditions that recount at length the adventures of legendary, historical, or mythical heroes surmounting the challenges facing them or their people.¹ The oldest known epic poem, the Babylonian
                  Epic of Gilgamesh, dates back to 1700 bce (Abusch 2001, 614). Homer’sIliadandOdysseycontinue this tradition in a poetic recounting of the events surrounding the Trojan War.² Today, epic poetry can be found in many countries, including India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tibet, as well as<br>

  Author(s) ARRIGO BRUCE A.<br>
  Abstract: Ethnographic studies of “dangerous men” have generally taken us behind bars. Erving Goffman’s (1961) arresting critique of the confinement setting as a generative milieu for the exercise of power helped to spawn a series of monograph-length works recounting life, death, and survival behind prison walls (e.g., Jacobs 1978; Sykes 1971; Toch 1977). A second wave of penological analysis, still concerned with “everyday experience” behind bars, challenged the correctional system as an extension of the state’s regulatory ambit. For example, Irwin’s (1970, 1985) studies of the felon and the jail respectively ushered in a new era of incisive commentary. Crime control<br>

  Abstract: Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–97), unlike Mary Astell or Anne Conway, is indisputably recognized as an important thinker of her time, and such recognition has in general not flagged since the early part of the nineteenth century. Unlike Hildegard, but perhaps like Anne Conway, Wollstonecraft is certainly recognized as a philosopher, for her works are lengthy enough and conceptually oriented enough that she is often included in anthologies of philosophical thought.¹ Thus, unlike Mary Astell—although both women are paradigmatically political thinkers—Wollstonecraft is not often labeled a “pamphleteer.”<br>

  Abstract: The department store, site of middle-class female consumer culture since the nineteenth century, demarks a zone in which women not only shop but, in the process of trying on apparel, communally disrobe, sometimes literally together within a huge open space, occasionally under the supervising eye of the saleswoman who monitors the cut and fit of the garments, more often alone before a full-length three-way mirror, producing a solitary portrait. In another part of the modern cityscape, bohemia, female models shed their clothes and pose nude or draped in fabric for life drawing and painting classes in artists’ studios. Each scene<br>

  Abstract: I start with a twisting trial of strength. Off I go; with turns of the wrist, this essay attempts to encapsulate two years’ worth of teaching, tries to condense time’s course into instructive droplets. Distilled, one lesson is that something lingering always escapes a teacher’s endeavor, gets set free by the jugfuls across multiple-month journeys. A pedagogical paradox in Jordanian blue: rescuing is an effort to uncap, never to contain. To en-flash, to dream.

Inspired and awed by the strength of the figure before him, Yank breaks his new friend out of his cage, only to be repaid with “a murderous hug.” Lying near death on the floor of the cage, Yank utters his last words “in the strident tones of a circus barker”: “Ladies and gents,<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Agency-Self-Making in China, India, and Japan<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Dissanayake Wimal<br>
  Abstract: This multidisciplinary collection underlines the importance of understanding the operations of human agency-defined here as the ability to exert power, specifically in resistance to ideological pressure. In particular, the contributors emphasize the historical and cultural conditions that facilitate the production of agency in an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures of China, India, and Japan. In Narratives of Agency, scholars from a variety of disciplines argue that traditional Western approaches to the study of these cultures have unduly focused on the pervasive influence of family and clan (China), caste and fatalism (India), and groupism (Japan). This tendency has been exacerbated by modern critical approaches, such as postmodernism and poststructuralism, that not only are increasingly popular in studying these cultures but also de-emphasize the role of the individual. The resultant undermining of the notion of human agency tends to give short shrift to the very real individual differences between groups and ignores questions of personal desire and intentionality. These essays remind us that members of a community have to make personal choices, struggle and interact with others, argue about positions, and confront new challenges, all of which involve intentionality and human agency. A new look at a topic central to cross-cultural understanding, Narratives of Agency will be essential reading for those interested in China, India, Japan, and the world beyond._x000B_ _x000B_Contributors: Richard G.

  Abstract: The critical success of
                  Street of Crocodilesgave the Quays artistic freedom to explore a shift in subject matter, in part originating in literary and poetic sources that led to exploration of new aesthetic forms, but also because they were able to make extensive experiments in technique, both with cameras and on large stage sets. The Quays are best known for their puppet and feature-length films. Less known, but no less incisive in their creative development, is their intense engagement in stage design for opera, ballet, and theater. Since 1988, the Quays have created sets and projections for performing arts<br>

Writing to Louise Colet in 1852, Flaubert reflected wistfully, “What seems beautiful to me, what I should like to write, is a book about nothing, a book dependent on nothing external, which would be held together by the internal strength of its style.”¹ In the first of his Clark lectures, given in 1927, E. M. Forster imagined three voices answering the question, “What does a novel do?” The third voice, his own, says regretfully, “Yes, oh dear yes,<br>

  Book Title: Modernist Commitments-Ethics, Politics, and Transnational Modernism<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berman Jessica<br>
  Abstract: Jessica Berman demonstrates how modernist narrative connects ethical attitudes and responsibilities to the active creation of political relationships and the way we imagine justice. She challenges divisions between "modernist" and "committed" writing, arguing that a continuum of political engagement undergirds modernisms worldwide and that it is strengthened rather than hindered by formal experimentation. In addition to making the case for a transnational model of modernism, Berman shows how modernism's play with formal matters, its challenge to the boundaries between fact and fiction, its incorporation of vernacular and folkways, and its engagement with embodied experience and intimacy offer not only an expanded account of modernist texts and commitments but a new way of thinking about what modernism is and can do.<br>

  4  PRAGMATISM AND ULTIMATE JUSTIFICATION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/brun16642">The Habermas Handbook</a><br>
  Author(s) KETTNER MATTHIAS<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas’s intellectual itinerary can hardly be understood without considering its critical and constructive interplay with the thought of Karl-Otto Apel—interactions between the two theorists have often marked significant turning points in Habermas’s project. Without the theoretical-architectonic alternatives that Apel’s reflections open, it would be impossible to evaluate the philosophical course Habermas has steered. Apel and Habermas are united by a lifelong professional friendship, which began when they studied together in Bonn in the early 1950s; since then, the liberating encounter with American pragmatism—of which Apel was one of the first German translators (1967, 1970)—has strengthened their<br>

  Abstract: Habermas’s exchange with Jacques Derrida is situated within the debate about modernity and postmodernity (see chapters 33 and 37). When he was awarded the Adorno Prize in 1980, Habermas defended the “unfinished project of modernity” in his acceptance speech; the opponents of modernity he identified included—in addition to old conservatives and neoconservatives of the recognizable variety—a group of “Young Conservatives,” among whom he numbered Michel Foucault and Derrida (“Modernity,” 53).

In this collection, Amy Allen, Geoffrey Bennington, Lynne Huffer, Colin Koopman, Pierre Macherey, Michael Naas, and Judith Revel, among others, trace this exchange in debates over the possibilities of genealogy and deconstruction, immanent and transcendent approaches to philosophy, and the practical and theoretical role of the archive.<br>

  Abstract: Should you happen to find yourself in America’s capital and take a stroll down the Washington Mall, then a crushing sight will besiege you: the National World War II Memorial. Dedicated in 2003 and explicitly designed to galvanise patriotic fervour, this colossal monument of victory – all eagles, columns, swagger, and bravado – boasts the merits of Western civilization. The size of a football field, flanked by balustrades of bronze, arches of blazing glory, and 70-foot poles flying American flags, the monument tells the simple story of victory and virtue. It is, to be blunt, the architecture of Hollywood heroism:<br>

  Abstract: Like all classics, Marx both “transcends” his own time and remains a thinker of the nineteenth century. With an incredibly imaginative strength, he was able to grasp tendencies that, still embryonic in his epoch, developed spectacularly during the following century. This astonishing modernity has led many scholars to interpret his works in naïvely anachronistic terms, as if they had been written in our age. Marx contributed to the forging of our lexicon, but many concepts through which we today apprehend the nineteenth century—for instance, imperialism—simply did not exist during his lifetime, or did not have the same meaning<br>

  Abstract: Samuel P.Huntington’s idea of the “third wave” of democ ratization has been remarkably influential and continues to figure importantly in democracy studies today. Ironically, by 1993, Huntington had already shifted his attention from the third wave to the clash of civilizations. In his 1991 article “Religion and the Third Wave,” Huntington suggests a causal relationship between Christianity and democracy that anticipates his much-debated thesis of 1993.¹ In his book

However, the book is essentially an elaboration, not a revision, of the original argument. To avoid distorting Huntington, I would like to present the core<br>

  Abstract: As Peter Metcalf and Richard Huntington have pointed out, divine kings and their relatives are natural symbols of the perpetuity and authority of the social order.¹ Nowhere in Classic Maya society was this perpetuity more important than in the personage of the king; the divine king embodied a force ultimately responsible for the maintenance of his polity religiously as well as politically. His fortunes were intimately linked with the fate of his site: his capture or sacrifice, admittedly the probable result of military or economic misfortunes, was the symbolic collapse of what Stephen Houston and others have termed “moral authority.”²<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Threads-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>

  Abstract: The Inka Empire stretched over much of the length and breadth of the South American Andes, encompassed elaborately planned cities linked by a complex network of roads and messengers, and created astonishing works of architecture and artistry and a compelling mythology-all without the aid of a graphic writing system. Instead, the Inkas' records consisted of devices made of knotted and dyed strings-called khipu-on which they recorded information pertaining to the organization and history of their empire. Despite more than a century of research on these remarkable devices, the khipu remain largely undeciphered.<br>

  Abstract: In this post-Einsteinian age, we are aware, as Plato and his heirs for over two millennia had not been, that time is a constituent and not merely an adjunct of material being. Over succeeding periods of time, matter enters into different and apparently irreversible states. When we think of the universe today, time has always to be figured in, as peremptorily as the dimensions of length, breadth, and thickness. This attention to time appears imperative today for any serious cosmology.<br>

  Book Title: Condemned to Repeat?-The Paradox of Humanitarian Action<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Terry Fiona<br>
  Abstract: Terry was the head of the French section of Medecins sans frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) when it withdrew from the Rwandan refugee camps in Zaire because aid intended for refugees actually strengthened those responsible for perpetrating genocide. This book contains documents from the former Rwandan army and government that were found in the refugee camps after they were attacked in late 1996. This material illustrates how combatants manipulate humanitarian action to their benefit.
      Condemned to Repeat?makes clear that the paradox of aid demands immediate attention by organizations and governments around the world. The author stresses that, if international agencies are to meet the needs of populations in crisis, their organizational behavior must adjust to the wider political and socioeconomic contexts in which aid occurs.<br>

  Abstract: The impression might arise that our lengthy exemplification of the ‘transition’ from metaphors to concepts (and thus our entire attempt at a typology of metaphor histories) remains beholden to a primitive evolutionary schema. We shall seek to dispel this impression by surveying a type of metaphor history that proceeds in the opposite direction, 
                  from concepts to metaphors. With respect to the evidence presented, we must fear having to hear the same reproach once leveled by Lessing against Privy Counselor Klotz: “And how many of them do you suppose that he cites? In all, summa summarum, rightly counted—one.”¹ But we<br>

  Book Title: Artifice and Design-Art and Technology in Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALLEN BARRY<br>
  Abstract: In an intriguing book about the aesthetics of technological objects and the relationship between technical and artistic accomplishment, Barry Allen develops the philosophical implications of a series of interrelated concepts-knowledge, artifact, design, tool, art, and technology-and uses them to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. This may be seen at the heart of
         Artifice and Designin Allen's discussion of seven bridges: he focuses at length on two New York bridges-the Hell Gate Bridge and the Bayonne Bridge-and makes use of original sources for insight into the designers' ideas about the aesthetic dimensions of their work. Allen starts from the conviction that art and technology must be treated together, as two aspects of a common, technical human nature.<br>

  Abstract: Two future adversaries and scholars of Antichrist overlapped at Cambridge, probably unknown to each other, in the 1580s. One attended Jesus College, the other Corpus Christi. As one was getting his bachelor’s, the other received a master’s. Afterwards they might both have taken the orders toward which their training inclined them, but only one did. The other was accused of nefarious activities and blasphemous opinions, of espionage, sodomy, and atheism. The accusations were eventually strengthened by his former schoolmate, now a minister and pedagogue, whose maiden publication included an account of his fellow graduate’s sacrilege, then murder, a few years<br>

  Abstract: To an extraordinary and perhaps even singular degree, Herder’s life and work are defined by the practice, function, and meaning of criticism. Despite the numerous other roles he occupied — and there were many: theologian, philosopher, linguist, historian, ethnographer, to name only a few — it was in his activity as a critic that Herder revealed his greatest strengths and arguably produced his most lasting achievements. Indeed, one might reasonably argue that Herder approached virtually everything he did

  Book Title: Verse and Voice in Byrd's Song Collections of 1588 and 1589-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Smith Jeremy L.<br>
  Abstract: As he grappled with the challenges of composing for various instrumental and vocal ensembles, William Byrd (c. 1540-1623), England's premier Renaissance composer, devoted considerable attention to the poetry and prose of his native language, producing such treasured masterpieces as the hauntingly beautiful "Lulla lullaby"; the infectiously comedic "Though Amarillis dance in green"; and two extraordinarily dramatic Easter anthems. This book, the first full-length study specifically devoted to Byrd's English-texted music, provides a close reading of all of the works he published in the late 1580s, constituting nearly half of his total song output. It delves into the musical, political, literary, and, specifically, the sequential qualities of Byrd's 1588 and 1589 published collections as a whole, revealing, explaining, and interpreting an overall grand narrative, while remaining fully attentive to the particularities of each individual piece. Often deemed "unliterary" and generally considered political only in his approach to Latin texts, which were often of special interest to his fellow Catholics, Byrd was not only an inspired composer who had mastered the challenges of his nation's burgeoning verse, but also one who used his voice in song to foster a more inclusive polity in a time of religious strife. Jeremy L. Smith is Associate Professor of Musicology at the University of Colorado Boulder.<br>

  Abstract: These words, written by Novalis, declare that philosophy begins in an act of self-destruction, or more precisely formulated: all properly philosophical acts aim to destroy the self. This demand is not as mysterious as it might seem. A self, by definition, is differentiated and limited, and thus represents one of the most palpable impediments to that which romantic philosophy seeks, namely, the absolute,
                  das Unbedingte, that which is without condition and without limit. A truly philosophical act must efface the horizon of limitations and differences that constitutes selfhood:Selbsttödtung, self-annihilation. The proper name for this act is not suicide,<br>

  Chapter 1  Historicizing Intersectionality as a Critical Lens: from:

  Author(s) May Vivian M.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars of intersectionality, historically and presently, start from the premise that both lived identities and structures of power and privilege should be understood as interwoven and not as additive factors or as separable dynamics. Intersectional approaches therefore entail a significant shift in epistemological, ontological, and methodological frames: fundamentally emphasizing simultaneity, scholars of intersectionality employ “tactics, strategies, and identities which historically have appeared to be mutually exclusive under modernist oppositional practices.” Because this alternative mode of reasoning can readily lead to charges of illogic, as Kimberlé Crenshaw has discussed at length, those who employ intersectionality frequently confront being misread or misunderstood.¹<br>

But Jay Prosser (2001b) insists that, whatever Updike’s supporters say about his talents, the decline in his reputation, though not “spectacular,” has been “significant.” Prosser believes this falling off is inevitable, because in his view Updike was never “America’s most representative contemporary author”; instead, if he “was ever<br>

It was the brainchild of Artur Hazelius who, in 1873, had founded the Nordiska Museet in Stockholm, which exhibited examples of folklife from around the country. It was Hazelius’s desire that the Nordiska Museet be ‘of benefit to science and at the same time arouse and fuel feelings of patriotism’, as well as ‘contribute to the strengthening of national feeling generation after generation, infusing love of one’s country … among young and old’.¹ This was a nationalism not of politics,<br>

However, one often overlooked element is the way in which Lope uses this text to engage in acts of judgement and even personal vendettas against his rivals. The purpose of this study is to examine how Lope moves his locus of enunciation<br>

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages.

  Book Title: Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'-An Analysis<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Langbehn Volker Max<br>
  Abstract: Arno Schmidt (1914-1979) is considered one of the most daring and influential writers of postwar Germany; the Germanist Jeremy Adler has called him a "giant of postwar German literature." Schmidt was awarded the Fontane Prize in 1964 and the Goethe Prize in 1973, and his early fiction has been translated into English to high critical acclaim, but he is not a well-known figure in the English-speaking world, where his complex work remains at the margins of critical inquiry. Volker Langbehn's book introduces Schmidt to the English-speaking audience, with primary emphasis on his most famous novel, 'Zettel's Traum'. One reviewer called the book an "elephantine monster" because of its unconventional size (folio format), length (1334 pages and over 10 million characters), and unique presentation of text in the form of notes, typewritten pages, parallel columns, and collages. The novel narrates the life of the main characters, Daniel Pagenstecher, Paul Jacobi and his wife Wilma, and their teenage daughter Franziska. In discussing the life and works of Edgar Allan Poe, the four engage in the problems connected with a translation of Poe. Langbehn's study investigates how literary language can mediate or account for the world of experiences and for concepts. Schmidt's use of unconventional presentation formats challenges us to analyze how we think about reading and writing literary texts. Instead of viewing such texts as a representation of reality, Schmidt's novel destabilizes this unquestioned mode of representation, posing a radical challenge to what contemporary literary criticism defines as literature.

                  Pride and Prejudice counts as a novel but Wuthering Heights is a romance, and offers the term “mythic narrative” for lengthy prose works organized by a marriage plot and portraying the “hierogamous” union of disparate partners whose love mirrors a cosmic conjunction like “the union of earth and sky.”² According to Hinz, marriage in a mythic narrative implicates the non-social as well as the social<br>

  Abstract: After four years of carnage Canada emerged from the Great War in 1918 bloodied but victorious, with a strengthened sense of national confidence and pride. The nation shared a feeling that it had come of age, its soldiers having proved themselves equal to any other combatants in their courage, ability, and self-sacrifice across the western front, at Vimy Ridge, and in the fields of Flanders. Canadian attitudes towards Great Britain changed significantly. Though English Canadians still considered theirs a British nation, they could no longer be content to be treated like colonial children by the mother country whose men they<br>

  Abstract: Even prior to its publication in Friedrich Schiller’s literary journal 
                  Die Horen in 1795, Goethe’s novella cycle Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten had already been assigned an eminent place in literary history: in a letter dated November 7, 1794, Schiller informed his friend Christian Körner that Goethe “ist jetzt beschäftigt, eine zusammenhängende Suite von Erzählungen im Geschmack des Decameron des Boccaz auszuarbeiten.”¹ Indeed, the structural borrowing from the Decameron is so undisguised in Unterhaltungen that it is undoubtedly meant to revive, under entirely new historical conditions, the genre of the novella as established by Boccaccio (1313–75).

  Abstract: In

  Abstract: In der Wissenschaftsgeschichte der Germanistik wurde bereits in unterschiedlichen Zusammenhängen die Goethe-Philologie als Paradigma für die Theorie-und Methodenentwicklung in der Literaturwissenschaft insgesamt beschrieben. Nicht ausreichend aufgearbeitet ist indes, dass die Neugermanistik im 19. Jahrhundert nicht nur aus der Goethe-Philologie heraus entstanden, sondern ihre disziplinäre Gestalt noch bis in die Gegenwart hinein von diesen Entstehungsbedingungen geprägt ist. Bei einzelnen Segmenten der wissenschaftlichen Terminologie—wie etwa bei den Gattungsbegriffen oder bei Begriffen wie “Symbol”—ist evident, dass wichtige Grundbegriffe noch der heutigen (deutschen) germanistischen Wissenschaftssprache nicht ohne Rekurs auf Goethe zu definieren sind.

  Book Title: Thomas King-Works and Impact<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Gruber Eva<br>
  Abstract: Thomas King is one of North America's foremost Native writers, best known for his novels, including 'Green Grass, Running Water', for the 'DreadfulWater' mysteries, and for collections of short stories such as 'One Good Story, That One' and 'A Short History of Indians in Canada.' But King is also a poet, a literary and cultural critic, and a noted filmmaker, photographer, and scriptwriter and performer for radio. His career and oeuvre have been validated by literary awards and by the inclusion of his writing in college and university curricula. Critical responses to King's work have been abundant, yet most of this criticism consists of journal articles, and to date only one book-length study of his work exists. 'Thomas King: Works and Impact' fills this gap by providing an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of all major aspects of King's oeuvre as well as its reception and influence. It brings together expert scholars to discuss King's role in and impact on Native literature and to offer in-depth analyses of his multifaceted body of work. The volume will be of interest to students and scholars of literature, English, and Native American studies, and to King aficionados.

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: Professional self‐awareness is widely considered a necessary condition for competent social work practice. Alternate prescriptions for self‐awareness rely implicitly on varying definitions of what it means to be a “self” and what it means to be “aware.” I will review three approaches to professional self‐awareness conventionally adopted in the literature: (
         a) simple conscious awareness (awareness of whatever is being experienced), (b) reflective awareness (awareness of a self who is experiencing something), and (c) reflexive awareness (the self's awareness of how his or her awareness is constituted in direct experience). Strengths and limitations of these three epistemological approaches are discussed. An alternate framework, based on Anthony Giddens's “structuration theory,” is developed and advanced as a more macro‐level and less exclusively psychological understanding of practitioner self‐awareness. The article concludes with illustrations from practice.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]]<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account.

But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995).

Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

Interestingly, this work also comes from a Columbia scholar, however much it is openly acknowledged to have derived largely from his experience at the New School for Social Research.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 152 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] and agency and to consider causal explanation without sacrificing the explication of subjective meaning-and vice versa. The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 443 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne does not fail to capture some aspects of social and political reality. This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 445 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume eventually came to be known), some of whom acted as patrons of the early LMS mission to the Tswana. The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people."

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 455 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elboume comment, at least as it pertains to the Comaroffs' own work. The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: Despite these caveats,
   Contemplative Nationis highly recommended for scholars of Jewish studies, religious studies, philosophy, and theology. The book is an excellent example of how to apply hermeneutical theories to the study of Judaism, how to bridge the gap between continental philosophy and analytic philosophy, and how to expand the scope of Jewish studies by appreciating the nature of theological discourse. While Judaica scholars could use the book in university-level courses, and rabbis could apply its approach to synagogue life, the claim that “Israel” is a “contemplative nation” will hardly resonate with most Jews today. It is very doubtful that the book could “guide the way for [the] future” of the Jewish people’s survival (226), precisely because Jews today are overwhelmingly secular, and the culture in which Jews live, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, is anti-intellectual and antitheological. Furthermore, if Fisher is so keen on Philo, he should have also reminded his readers of the fate of Philo’s enterprise: it was no coincidence that Philo became one of the Church Fathers and that his exegetical/hermeneutical project was not adopted by the tradition that became normative Judaism. When “Israel” denotes a nation of divine contemplators, “carnal Israel” (namely “Israel” as a historical, cultural, and ethnic entity) is marginalized, denigrated, and persecuted. It is true that Jewish religious life is theological, but being Jewish cannot be reduced to contemplating God.<br>

Author(s): Mooij J. J. A.<br>
Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: Both
      Faith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsilluminate and challenge the assumptions in Voegelin's philosophy and lead readers in new directions for Voegelinian scholarship. They are indispensable readings for students of political philosophy in their examination of transcendence, philosophy, and politics. By seeing Voegelin as a postmodern thinker and by showing his exchange with Strauss, both of these books provide us with a broader context to understand Voegelin's political philosophy. As part of the University of Missouri Press' new series, bothFaith and PhilosophyandEric Voegelin's Dialogues with the Postmodernsprovide intellectually provocative and serious-minded secondary works on Eric Voegelin and his ultimate place in political philosophy.<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: Abstract.
         Gadamer's pursuit inTruth and Methodof an applicative literary hermeneutics modeled on legal hermeneutics earns him the status of a precursor to the emergence of what is known in North America as the “literature and law movement.” Attentive to the debates and controversies surrounding this movement, this article seeks to explore an interpretive interzone in which the judge and the literary critic, if they apply themselves to a poetics of elasticity, might be of exemplary significance to each other. The notion of “exemplarity” does not, however, imply a mechanical appropriation of the practices of the one by the other, but a mutually nuanced and complicated approximation of the strengths of each by the other. In the light of this normative poetics of proximity and distance, Dworkin's model of the “chain novel” is assessed and supplemented by (an alternative) model grounded in Foucault's genealogy of authorship as expounded in his article “What Is an Author?”<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented. Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on “detainee abuse” at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003) “constructionist analytics,” I examine the textual mediation of claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing participants put these realities. I show that developments in the textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a textually mediated vantage on events that “really occurred” throughout Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making activities, including the production of a textual reality of human rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of social problems.<br>

Abstract: Longterm trends are examined for the population mass that occupied the central highlands of Palestine during the Iron Age. After 1200 B. C. the landscape of this sparsely populated "frontier" changed as newcomers established hilltop villages, cultivated intermontane valleys, and terraced the slopes. Spatial patterning within villages and certain toponyms were influenced by patrilineal kinship. Heads of household and their lineage mates exercised rights over inheritance and succession in landholding. Inequalities developed within "tribal" Israel long before the monarchy, probably through a process of "lineage capture;" and clientship, with its dyadic relationships between superiors and inferiors, became more common. Tensions developed within Israelite society from the interactions of kinship, clientship, and kingship. As the population grew under the monarchy, the highland frontier was effectively closed, and opportunities for acquiring new land diminished. Thus, many unmarried males had to look elsewhere for patrons and positions. From the ranks of these noble "youths" came recruits for the military, the government, and the priesthood.<br>

Abstract: This article draws upon theories from a wide range of disciplines, including cultural studies and literary theory, to analyse representations of schooling in rock and pop songs. The songs selected cover a period from the beginning of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, to Britpop and the present. It is argued that schooling is overwhelmingly represented as the antithesis of leisure and that in the 1960s conjuncture the representations of schooling became more and more critical. Even so, the resolution to the perceived oppression of schooling takes place at an imaginary level of fantasy. Other features of these representations are discussed, including the challenge provided in pop and rock songs to the notion of schools as spaces where relationships, romantic and/ or sexual, do not take place. The way in which temporal aspects of schooling are represented and the division between clock time and time as experienced is discussed. The formal analysis is located within a larger project of ideology critique and its strengths and weaknesses are signalled.<br>

Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Abstract: In Sumatra's Angkola Batak culture, rituals celebrating major kinship-related events such as marriage have many layers of social and symbolic meaning; they have political, kinship, musical, mythic, and philosophical dimensions as lengthy, oratory-filled ceremonies that unite wife-giving lineages with wife-receivers. This article examines several ways that the interpretive approach that is discussed in the introduction can help students of Indonesian ritual grasp diverse aspects of Batak marriage rituals such as their hidden symbolic organization and their practical political implications. The article deals with a short sequence of adat dance staged for anthropological research purposes. (Adat, once translated as customary law, roughly means Angkola ceremonial life, kinship norms, and political thought; adat is eminently flexible, redefined by each Batak generation.) The choreography of the dance (wife-receivers dancing with wife-givers), songs, clothing, the political biographies of the participants, and the fact that the event was staged render the ceremony open to both structural and social contextual inquiry.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Author(s): Rhodes R. A. W.<br>
Abstract: What intellectual influence, if any, have British public administration scholars had on their American counterparts since World War II? In this article, the author briefly reviews the major areas of theory and research in the British study of publication administration, further identifying important contributions by British scholars in the areas of modernist-empiricism, the new public management, regulation, policy networks and governance, and interpretive theory. Although there is a discernible American influence on British public administration, there is little British impact on U.S. public administration; nowadays it is a one-way street. Increasingly, British scholars are involved in a growing community of European public administration scholars with whom they share active, two-way connections. Recent European developments suggest that American and European public administration academics are growing further apart. Due to the immense strength of modernist-empiricism throughout American universities, plus the interpretive turn to a European epistemology of "blurred genres," these twin, traditionally self-referential, communities seem to be parting company with an attendant danger that future intellectual engagement may be a dead end.<br>

Abstract: What is the direction of South African theological ethics as that country moves out of the apartheid era into a new democratic future? Following its struggle against apartheid, how will theology respond to the new challenge of making clear its distinctive stance in a democratic, multi-faith society with a secular constitution? A danger, similar to that previously discussed in the United States, exists in South Africa as theology evolves from a mode of resistance to that of compliance and accommodation, especially under the guise of "nation-building." The essay plots a trajectory by means of a consideration of four works representing nonracial liberationist theology which emerged at key points in the past fifteen years—the Kairos Document (1985), and works by Albert Nolan (1988), Charles Villla-Vicencio (1992), and James Cochrane (1999). For all their contextual sensitivity and strength, these works appear to offer little of a distinctively theological nature, and little of Christian substance to church and society. The way lies open for the development of an African Christian ethics.<br>

Journal Title: The British Journal of Social Work<br>
Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i23714806<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): BANKS SARAH<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the ethical implications of recent changes in social work, particularly in relation to the conception of social workers as professionals guided by a code of ethics. These changes include the fragmentation of the occupation, the increasing proceduralization of the work and the growing focus on consumer rights and user participation. Some people have argued that codes of ethics are becoming increasingly irrelevant in this climate, in that they assume a unified occupational group and are based upon professionals' definition of values without consultation with service users. On the other hand, it has also been maintained that it is ever more important to retain and strengthen codes of ethics in order to maintain professional identity and to defend the work of the profession from outside attack. This paper explores the relevance of a code of professional ethics for social work, focusing particularly on the British Association of Social Workers' code, in the context of the changing organization and practice of the work. It considers two alternative approaches: the 'new consumerism' which focuses on the worker's technical skills (rather than professional ethics) and consumer rights (as opposed to professional obligations); and a 'new radicalism' which stresses the worker's own personal or political commitment and individual moral responsibility (as opposed to an externally imposed code of professional ethics). It is concluded that the changes in social work do threaten the notion of a single set of professional ethics articulated in a code, and that, in some types of work, this model is less appropriate. However, there is still mileage in retaining and developing a code of ethics, not as an imposed set of rules developed by the professional association, but as part of a dynamic and evolving ethical tradition in social work and as a stimulus for debate and reflection on changing and contradictory values.<br>

Abstract: Der gewichtigste Einwand gegen eine solche Interpretation geht von dem Anspruch der Psy-
choanalyse aus, eine Wissenschaft, ein wissenschaftliches Verfahren zu sein. Als solche und solches
behauptet Psychoanalyse sich, wenn auch nicht unangefochten, innerhalb der klinischen Medizin.
Gerade der kritische Angriff, der von naturwissenschaftlich ausgerichteten Medizinern und verhal-
tenstherapeutisch orientierten Psychologen ausgeht, verstärkt das Bemühen der Psychoanalytiker,
Psychoanalyse als Wissenschaft auszuweisen und zu erhärten. Um die Art von Wissenschaftlichkeit,
um welche es in der Psychoanalyse geht und gehen kann, gibt es unter den Analytikern Meinungs-
verschiedenheiten, kaum einer aber würde den Anspruch auf Wissenschaftlichkeit aufgeben. „My-
stisches" mit Psychoanalyse in Verbindung zu bringen, dergestalt, daß Psychoanalyse gar irgend-
wann und irgendwo in „Mystischem" gründe, muß als absurd, allenfalls eines Abwinkens wert er-
scheinen. Es schadet dem Ansehen. Zustimmung wird dort zu finden sein, wo man zur Meinung
neigt, immer schon gewußt zu haben, daß Psychoanalyse etwas Obskures sei. In dieser fachhistori-
schen Situation wird es schwer halten zu zeigen, daß, mit Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker zu spre-
chen, die „Anerkennung einer meditativen und mystischen Erfahrung.... wenn wir richtig argu-
mentiert haben, eine Konsequenz des Verständnisses des Wesens der Rationalität" darstellt (von
Weizsäcker, S. 480). Darüber hinaus weiß der Psychoanalytiker, daß er bei seinem Analysanden
Einsicht nicht durch argumentierendes Eingehen auf mancherlei Argumentationen erzeugt, sondern
durch die Möglichkeit von Erfahrung in einem Prozeß. Dies gilt dann aber auch für jene Elemente
eines Prozesses umwandelnder Erfahrung, welche über das klassische Selbstverständnis der Psycho-
analyse hinaus erreichen.<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: Unsere Literaturübersicht diskutiert die Frage, ob und inwieweit eine reife Liebesfähigkeit Erwachsener von entsprechenden Früherfahrungen abhängt bzw. inwieweit Liebe und Partnerschaft eine Korrektur ungünstiger emotionaler Erfahrungen der frühen Kindheit ermöglichen. Bestimmte Partnerschaftsstörungen stehen zu konkreten familiären Gegebenheiten der ersten Lebensjahre in keinem zwingenden Bezug. Sind Partnerschaftsstörungen nach traditioneller psychoanalytischer Auffassung als Folge eines ungelösten infantilen Konfliktes anzusehen, so greifen neuere Ansätze angesichts des weitgehenden Fehlens einer psychoanalytischen Interaktionstheorie bei der Beschreibung und Erklärung interpersoneller Phänomene zunehmend auf systemische Ansätze zurück. Äußerungen psychoanalytischer Autoren zur Entwicklung der Liebesfähigkeit reflektieren im historischen Überblick wesentliche Veränderungen der Theoriebildung. Neuere empirische Arbeiten weisen auf Korrektur- und Kompensationsmöglichkeiten ungünstiger Früherfahrungen von mittlerem Schweregrad hin. Dafür aber dürfte die warme und bedürfnisgerechte Zuwendung durch eine oder mehrere feste Bezugspersonen (möglichst durch die liebevoll und partnerschaftlich aufeinander bezogenen Eltern) in den ersten Lebensjahren eine grundlegende Voraussetzung erwachsener Liebes- und Partnerschaftsfähigkeit sein. In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From an historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.<br>

Abstract: Un autre exemple de trivialité : au début de son texte, Badiou évoque un conflit, une
« guerre abstraite » actuellement en cours entre vision juive et vision chrétienne de l'histoire;
et donc, selon lui, la Mémoire... s'inscrit dans cette rivalité pour conquérir la « direction spiri-
tuelle du camp "démocratique" ». Et attention, Ricœur vise à « rien moins qu'une victoire »!
Le déclin de l'influence chrétienne et le brio de la pensée juive au sens large (sans garantie de
durée!) dans la culture française et européenne sont patents, mais ce constat accrédite-t-il une
vision paranoïaque de la vie intellectuelle? D'autres exemples dans le Siècle, op. cit., par
exemple une parole d'un poème de Celan inspiré de la mémoire d'Auschwitz, rapportée par
Badiou aux slogans des manifestants de décembre 1995 pour leur retraite, à Roanne-Trifouillis-
les-Oies : « Tous ensemble, tous ensemble, ouais! » (p. 139).<br>

Depuis, l'Allemagne a adopté un projet de loi qui précise que la circoncision est autorisée si
l'opération respecte un cadre médical professionnel, afin d'éviter des jugements comme celui
de Cologne, qui avait provoqué un tollé dans les communautés juive et musulmane.<br>

Abstract: L'action humanitaire a eu vingt ans l'an dernier. Au-delà de savoir si elle a triomphé ou échoué, mieux vaut s'interroger sur ce qui déchire ses principaux acteurs et comprendre les conflits qui opposent les pères fondateurs (Kouchner, Malhuret, Emmanuelli, Brauman). Plutôt que d'opposer abruptement l'humanitaire et la politique, on aura sûrement beaucoup à gagner à imaginer un triangle de l'humanitaire où les pôles juridique, éthique et politique se renforcent mutuellement.<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: Der Begriff der Dialektik, der zur Beschreibung einer derartigen Verbindung zwischen
Ursprung und Ziel gern reserviert wird, wäre hier unangemessen, weil er die Differenz unter-
schlägt, die Trieb und Mythos wie Unsichtbares und Sichtbares trennt. Freuds Deutung bringt
den Mythos im Trieb zum Verschwinden, aber umgekehrt den Trieb im Teufel zur Präsenz. Die
kulturtheoretischen Erzählungen der Psychoanalyse verschaffen dieser Präsenz eine Bühne, die
nicht nur der Vorführung des Teufels, sondern auch der Demonstration der eigenen erkenntnis-
kritischen Leistung dient; vgl. dazu H. Böhme: Fetischismus und Kultur, a.a.O. [Anm. 9] 408ff.<br>

Abstract: Während Strasser einen theoretischen Nihilismus befürchtet (vgl. Stephan Strasser: Von
einer Husserl-Interpretation zu einer Husserl-Kritik. Nachdenkliches zu Jacques Derridas Denk-
weg. In: Phänomenologische Forschungen 18 (1986). Studien zur neueren französischen Phäno-
menologie, 165 f.), wird die Relativität der Wahrheit, die „kein Historismus je hätte ahnen kön-
nen", von Levinas durchaus positiv bewertet. Derrida denke Bergsons Kritik des Seins und
Kants Kritik der Metaphysik zu Ende, so daß er die Möglichkeit einer ethischen Philosophie des
Begehrens eröffne (vgl. Emmanuel Lévinas: Ganz anders - Jacques Derrida. In: Ders.: Eigenna-
men. Meditationen über Sprache und Literatur. München 1988. 67 ff.). Zwar philosophiert Der-
rida aus einer ethischen Haltung der Verantwortung heraus, aber Levinas verkennt, daß für Der-
rida das theoretische Anliegen, den verdrängten Voraussetzungen des abendländischen Wissens
nachzuspüren, wichtiger bleibt denn eine theologische Ethik des Anderen.<br>

Abstract: Jan Edward Garrett meint, daß es bei Gadamer zwei verschiedene Begriffe der Horizont-
verschmelzung gäbe, d. h. eine schweigende Horizontverschmelzung und eine explizite und ab-
sichtliche, die der ersteren folge. Die Horizontverschmelzung ist aber in Wirklichkeit ein Phäno-
men nach der Entstehung des historischen Bewußtseins, während die Vermittlung der Vergangen-
heit mit der Gegenwart ein allgemeines Phänomen darstellt, das immer geschieht, obwohl die Ho-
rizontverschmelzung eine spezifische Form der Vermittlung ist. Garrett verwechselt die Hori-
zontverschmelzung mit der Vermittlung überhaupt. Die „schweigende Horizontverschmelzung"
ist ein attributiver Widerspruch, weil die Horizontverschmelzung eine mit dem historischen Be-
wußtsein vollzogene, absichtliche und „kontrollierte" (312) Vermittlung ist. Die Vermittlung
überhaupt beginnt vom Anfang des Verstehens an, während die Horizontverschmelzung erst an
seinem Ende stattfindet. Vgl. J. E. Garrett: Hans-Georg Gadamer on „Fusion of Horizons".

Abstract: L'histoire quantitative aujourd'hui n'est plus à la mode. Pendant une génération, aux lendemains de la seconde guerre mondiale, elle a constitué pour les historiens français une pratique dominante, et la référence par rapport à laquelle furent longtemps jaugées les manières de faire de l'histoire. La tendance aujourd'hui s'est inversée. Le doute s'est répandu quant à la capacité du chiffre à rendre compte des compartements les plus fondamentaux. En examinant certaines manières de faire de l'histoire quantitative toujours fructueuses et en se gardant de certaines impasses, on cherche à montrer que la démonstration historique ne peut se ramener ni à une logique de la persuasion, ni à une logique de la narration. Les critères de sa pertinence doivent s'apprécier à l'articulation de la définition d'une problématique, des modalités de sa mise en oeuvre expérimentale, et de la confrontation au démenti des données empiriques des propositions historiques. Quantitative history is no longer in fashion. For a generation after the Second World War, it was the usual practice for French historians and the reference for judging work in history. This frame of trend has now been reversed. Doubt has spread concerning the capacity of numbers to explain the most important behaviours. While taking in consideration different styles of research in quantitative history which are always fruitful, and being aware of certain kinds of types of deadlocks, one wants to show how historic demonstration must never be pure persuasion nor pure story. The criteria of its pertinency must be appreciated adequately between the definition of problematic and of testing ground, and in confrontation between empirical data and historical assertions.<br>

Abstract: Evoquant l'habitude, Ricœur constate qu'elle donne une histoire au
caractère : « une histoire dans laquelle la sédimentation tend à recouvrir et, à la
limite, à abolir l'innovation qui l'a précédée [...]. C'est cette sédimentation qui
confère au caractère la sorte de permanence dans le temps que j'interprète ici
comme recouvrement de Y ipse par l'idem ». In Soi-même comme un autre,
Paris, Seuil, 1990, p. 146.
L'ipseque Philippe Corcuff synthétise comme « la part subjective de l'identité
personnelle » (« Figures de l'individualité, de Marx aux sociologies
contemporaines », Espacestemps.net, web : http://www.espacestemps.net/
documentl390.html, 2005, non paginé) renvoie à la possibilité de n'être que
partiellement investi dans un rôle. On glisse ici du caractère à l'appartenance
pour amener cette idée d'un retrait ou d'une déprise de l'identité stabilisée
autour de symboles rigides en faveur de moments de mise en avant d'une
identité personnelle répondant à un besoin d'individualisation.<br>

Abstract: The superfluity arises from the fact that this "double of Krsna" never has to
take the reins, since Nala is driving; see Hiltebeitel, Rethinking, 232-33. As men-
tioned in n. 7 above, J. Brockington finds this "implausible." For valuable discus-
sion of the "avatära" theme in both epics, and especially in the Rämäyam, see

Abstract: Même si ce n'était pas l'objet de ce travail, et outre les féconds prolongements de l'anthro-
pologie historique déjà évoqués au début de cet article, il faut rappeler les fructueux échanges
empiriques que les historiens, en particulier pour le Moyen Âge, ont pu avoir depuis vingt ans avec
différents courants de l'anthropologie, qu'il s'agisse par exemple de l'anthropologie juridique dans
le cadre des débats sur la mutation de l'an mil (cf. les travaux de Dominique Barthélémy [1997,
1999]), de l'anthropologie visuelle de chercheurs comme Hans Belting (cf. Schmitt [2002];
ou Baschet [2008]), de l'anthropologie des pratiques d'écriture dans la lignée de Jack Goody
(pour une présentation synthétique de l'historiographie médiévale dans ce domaine, cf. Chastang
[2008]), de l'anthropologie économique (avec Feller, Gramain & Weber [2005]), ou encore des
réflexions de Maurice Godelier ou de Louis Dumont (mobilisés par Iogna-Prat [1998, 2006]).<br>

Abstract: Het actualistisch historisme onderscheid ik van het traditionalistisch historisme. Het laatste
kent een normatief bindend gezag toe aan het zogenaamd historisch gewordene, dikwijls gezien
als iets dat tot stand gekomen is krachtens een verborgen wetmatigheid, wel geduid als een
voorzienig plan. Het eerste tendeert er naar een normatieve waarde te hechten aan de geschie-
denis van het nu, waarbij dat nu nog meer of minder uitgestrekt kan zijn. Het laatste is derhalve
gekenmerkt door een uitgesproken conservat-isme en neigt tot een verheerlijking van de status
quo. Het eerste vertoont revolutionaire trekken als gevolg van een miskenning van de norm
van de historische continuïteit.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

possible usurpation of divine sovereignty (GB 268).<br>

Abstract: Broad definitions are often used in Christian apologetics. One example: 'Everyone has a
worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that
affect the way we view all of life and reality. A worldview is like a set of lenses which taint our
vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i25075156<br>
Date: 11 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Arenas Daniel<br>
Abstract: Based on the experience of a course taught by the authors, this paper seeks to show that an adequate use of IT in the teaching of a Business Etchics (BE) course depends on clarifying the assumptions about ethics and the place of the course within a programme. For this purpose it explains how IT can be used to strengthen a view of BE based on dialogue and mutual learning and it encourages the combination between virtual and face-to-face teaching. Finally, the paper examines the relationship between the use of IT, individual learning processes and communities of practice.<br>

Abstract: Este trabajo está dedicado a todos los que, como Maximilian M. Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Publisher: LEO S. OLSCHKI<br>
Issue: i26263326<br>
Date: 12 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Ossola Carlo<br>
Abstract: J. L. Borges, The unending Rose, poesia eponima della raccolta: La Rosa pro-
funda, Buenos Aires, Emecé Editores 1975; poi in Obra poètica, 1923-1977, Buenos
Aires-Madrid, Alianza Très / Emecé 1983 (da cui citiamo). La citazione alla p. 465.
La « rosa profonda » è veramente « fior silenciosa », traccia d'inesprimibile che
attraversa e sigilla tutta la poesia di Borges, dalla « inattingibile rosa » che apre la
prima raccolta Fervor de Buenos Aires, del 1923 all'« insensata rosa », negli anni
ultimi, di Efialtes. Ma come non riportare qui - almeno - quella prima « rosa de
la rosas »?: « La rosa, / la inmarcesible rosa que no canto, / la que es peso y fragancia, /
la del negro jardin en la alta noche, / la de cualquier jardin y cualquier tarde, / la
rosa que resurge de la tenue / ceniza por el arte de la alquimia, / la rosa de los persas
y de Ariosto, / la que siempre està sola, / la que siempre es la rosa de las rosas, /
la joven fior platonica, / la ardiente y ciega rosa que no canto, / la rosa inalcanzable »
(J. L. Borges, La rosa, da Fervor de Buenos Aires; ora in Obra poètica cit., p. 38).
Come non ricordare la - così prossima a la « memoria... / de un distico de Angelus
Silesius » - «invisibile rosa» di Una rosa y Milton: «De las generaciones de las
rosas / Que en el fondo del riempo se han perdido / Quiero que una se salve del
olvido, / Una sin marca ο signo entre las cosas / Que fueron. El destino me depara /
Este don de nombrar por vez primera / Esa fior silenciosa, la postrera / Rosa que
Milton acercó a su cara, / Sin verla. Oh tu bermeja ο amarilla / Ο bianca rosa de
un jardin borrado, / Deja màgicamente tu pasado / Inmemorial y en este verso brilla, /
Oro, sangre ο marfil ο tenebrosa / Como en sus manos, invisible rosa » (J. Borges,
Una rosa y Milton, da El otro, el mismo; ora in Obra poètica cit., p. 213).
E se è vero che nella quartina iniziale del Golem, Borges sembra avvicinarsi ai
« nomina nuda » ricordati da Eco: « Si (corno el griego afirma en el Cratilo) / El
nombre es arquetipo de la cosa, / En las letras de rosa esta la rosa / Y todo el Nilo
en la palabra Nilo»); è ugualmente vero che si tratta di «un terrible Nombre»,
« articulación del Sacro Nombre », nome rivelato ma non articolabile, come mirabil-
mente sigilla, nell'estrema visione concessa al Marino, Una rosa gialla: « Allora accadde
la rivelazione. Marino vide la rosa, come potè vederla Adamo nel Paradiso, e senti
che essa stava nella sua eternità e non nelle sue parole e che noi possiamo menzionare
ο alludere ma non esprimere » (J. L. Borges, Una rosa gialla, da El hacedor; trad. it.:
in Antologia personale, Milano, Silva 1965, p. 123).
Così anche questo percorso è stato vano tender a « la rosa inalcanzable », essa
« fior silenciosa ».<br>

Abstract: Ricordo, a titolo di esempio, solo alcuni degli scrittori e degli studiosi che non
hanno avuto, per così dire, accesso alla rassegna (pur se implicitamente e continuamente
vivissimi all'attenzione di chi scrive) per l'impossibilità oggettiva di esibire lo sconfinato
universo delle presenze bibliche nella letteratura compresa tra il Duecento e il primo Ot-
tocento: il Dante delle opere 'minori', soprattutto della Vita Nuova (V. Branca, G. Gor-
ni), la predicazione medievale e moderna (C. Delcorno, R. Rusconi, L. Bolzoni, J. Berlioz,
etc.), le laude (G. Varanini, R. Bettarini, F. Mancini etc.), la sacra rappresentazione (M.
Martelli, N. Newbigin, F. Doglio, G. Ponte, F. Pezzarossa), il Boccaccio delle Rime e
delle Epistole (V. Branca, G. Auzzas) e di alcune parti del Decameron (P. Cherchi), la
produzione 'sacra' tassiana (Rime Sacre, Mondo Creato), l'Aretino (Larivaille) e il Folengo
(M. Chiesa, S. Gatti) nei panni di scrittori cristiani, l'Arcadia edificante, per riprendere
un titolo preciso del Di Biase, certa tragedia sacra settecentesca come quella di Martello
(I. Magnani, P. Trivero) e, soprattutto, l'Alfieri biblico del Saul e dell'Abele (A. Di Bene-
detto, E. Raimondi), lo Jacopo Ortis (M. A. Terzoli) e l'Ipercalisse del Foscolo (B. Rosada,
A. Forlini), il linguaggio poetico religioso del Porta (G. Pozzi) e del Belli, il Tommaseo
(M. Guglielminetti), il Pascoli (A. Traina, G. Goffis), D'Annunzio e molti altri ancora:
spesso, tra l'altro, privi di una vera e propria bibliografia «scritturale» a largo spettro,
se non di studi singoli, difficilmente annoverabili nell'ambito ristretto di una precisazione
doverosa, ma non esaustiva. Va detto anche che, sebbene la rassegna si chiuda con il
1995, qua e là è stato segnalato qualche libro del 1996, a cui si vuole ora aggiungere,
senza l'ambizione di averne citato tutti i volumi relativi all'oggetto delle precedenti pagi-
ne, A. Stauble, Le sirene eterne. Studi sull'eredità classica e biblica nella letteratura italia-
na, Ravenna, Longo, 1996; e E. Esposito, R. Manica, N. Longo, R. Scrivano, Memo-
ria biblica nell'opera di Dante, Roma, Bulzoni, 1996.<br>

Abstract: The notion of mathesis is recurrent in Barthes (see Barthes par Barthes, p. 122). In
that respect, the terms mathematics and mathesis should be understood in their literal
Greek acceptation, as knowledge, and the process of knowledge.<br>

Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Author(s): Lopes Helena<br>
Abstract: This article begins by presenting experimental evidence that remains unexplained by standard and utility-extended economic models: experimental subjects tend to honor their promises even on occasions when an assessment of consequences asks them to defect; subjects voluntarily contribute to collective goods, and this contribution is highly conditional on others contributing as well; subjects evaluate and value the intentions behind actions as well as the consequences of actions. Arguments are sought for in moral philosophy that would more plainly explain the collected experimental evidence and that would help economists revise their explanatory frames. The hypothesis advanced is that the observed behavior may be interpreted as resulting from the moral strength of indignation and justice norms.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: In diesem Zusammenhang muß natürlich von kalligraphischen und sphragistischen
Aspekten der Urkundenbetrachtung abgesehen werden, denn diese beiden fallen nicht nur
in den Gegenstandsbereich der Historie, sondern auch in jenen der Kunstgeschichte, fur
die Fragen der Ästhetik zentral sind.<br>

Author(s): Leone Mark P.<br>
Abstract: Archaeologists have tried to reconstruct patterns of thought, meaning, and ideas, using theories of structuralism, cognition, and ideology. Case studies involving each of the theories are described, and the strengths and weakness of their application to archaeological data are presented. Structuralism is found to yield substantial examples with well-worked treatments of archaeological data. These examples tend to ignore economic context, however. Materialism, especially neo-Marxism, contains thorough definitions of ideology that may be useful to archaeology because they preserve economic context. However, such definitions are new to the field and presently offer few well-worked examples of how to handle archaeological data.<br>

Abstract: In this paper we argue that archaeologists and anthropologists should be aware of forces that encourage the separation of archaeology from anthropology. Sociological, organizational, and intellectual factors that do not necessarily have disciplinary separation as their logical consequence can nonetheless have a cumulative effect that moves the relationship between the subfields of anthropology in the direction of greater or lesser independence. We compare the relative strength of certain factors that could either encourage or discourage the perpetuation of four-field anthropology in Canada and the United States.<br>

Author(s): Somers Rudra<br>
Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: The paper begins with a clarification of the terms 'effective' versus 'successful' teacher and their implications. There follows a summary of the results of a study addressing the issues: a) which Careers Education and Guidance (CEG) aims in Greece are considered most important, and b) what constitutes a successful careers teacher. The study is based on the responses of careers coordinators in Greece and consultants at the Greek Pedagogical Institute. Issues concerning Information and Self-Awareness as Careers Education and Guidance aims are discussed, and an alternative approach to Information is suggested. The main emphasis is placed on the importance of the teacher as an indispensable factor for the implementation of CEG aims in particular, and educational aims in general. /// Der Artikel beginnt mit der Klärung der Begriffe "effektive" gegen "erfolgreiche" Lehrer und deren Bedeutung. Es folgt eine Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse einer Studieüber die Themen: a) welche Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden in Griechenland als wichtig angesehen und b) was macht einen in der Berufsberatung erfolgreichen Lehrer aus. Die. Studie basiert auf den Antworten derer, die die Berufsberatung in Griechenland koordinieren sowie der Berater im Griechischen Pädagogischen Institut. Streitfragen über Information und Selbsterkenntnis als Ziele der Berufsberatung und -lenkung werden diskutiert, und ein alternativer Ansatz zu Information vorgeschlagen. Das Hauptgewicht wird vor allem auf die Bedeutung des Lehrers als unersetzlicher Faktor für die Durchsetzung der Ziele von Berufsberatung und -lenkung im besonderen und die erzieherischen Ziele im allgemeinen gelegt. /// Le présent article commence par une clarification des termes "efficacité" et "succès" de l'enseignant et de leurs implications. On présente ensuite un résumé des résultats d'une étude portant sur les questions suivantes: a) quels sont les objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles considérés comme les plus importants en Grèce, et b) qu'est-ce qui contribue au succès d'un professeur d'enseignement professionnel. Cette étude se fonde sur les réponses des coordinateurs de l'enseignement professionnel en Grèce et des consultants à l'Institut pédagogique grec. On discute des questions concernant l'information et la conscience de soi comme objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles, et l'on suggère une nouvelle approche de l'information. L'accent majeur est mis sur l'importance de l'enseignant en tant que facteur indispensable à la réalisation des objectifs de la formation et de l'orientation professionnelles en particulier, et des objectifs éducatifs en général.<br>

Abstract: A comparison of Giuseppe Bagetti's landscape sketches, watercolours, oil paintings and engravings with contemporary maps and the existing landscape reveals that in the creation of Bagetti's landscapes, narrative played a role that differed in cartographic and artistic representations. The comparison also demonstrates that his images were powerful constructions that were more successful in reflecting a narrative of glorious conquest than was possible through cartography. This paper offers a critical examination of Bagetti's representations of Napoleon's northern Italian campaign, which he sketched and painted between 1802 and 1809. Bagetti's paintings were neither pacifist nor an expression of Piedmontese patriotism but instead were inspired by, and constructed according to, a narrative about the conquest that reflected the views of the French authorities. The narrative found expression in formal written instructions from the central cartographical office in the Dépôt de la guerre, Paris, in verbal and written instructions from Bagetti's immediate superior, Jean François Martinel, and in letters personally addressed to Bagetti from the officer commanding the Dépôt. It is clear from a careful reading of the correspondence and from a comparison of Bagetti's paintings with both the present landscape and maps made at the time that Bagetti's disputes with his supervisors revolved around protecting his artistic integrity and reputation rather than resisting the authority of a foreign regime. /// Une comparaison entre les dessins, aquarelles, peintures et gravures de paysages de Giuseppe Bagetti avec des cartes de son temps et les paysages actuels révèle que dans la création des paysages de Bagetti le récit ne joue pas le même rôle que dans les représentations cartographiques et artistiques. La comparaison démontre également que ses images étaient des constructions puissantes qui reflétaient l'histoire d'une conquête victorieuse plus efficacement que la cartographie ne le permettait. Cet article propose un examen critique des représentations des campagnes napoléoniennes en Italie du Nord, dessinées ou peintes par Bagetti entre 1802 et 1809. Les peintures de Bagetti n'étaient ni pacifistes, ni représentatives d'un patriotisme piémontais, mais au contraire inspirées par un récit de la conquête qui reflétait les vues des autorités françaises et construites selon celui-ci. Ce récit se trouvait exprimé dans les instructions écrites de l'office central de cartographie du Dépôt de la Guerre à Paris, dans les instructions verbales et écrites du supérieur direct de Bagetti, Jean-François Martinel, et dans les lettres adressées à Bagetti en personne par l'officier qui dirigeait le Dépôt. Il est clair, si on lit attentivement la correspondance et si l'on compare les peintures de Bagetti avec le paysage actuel et les cartes faites à l'époque, que les discussions entre Bagetti et ses chefs tournaient autour de la préservation de son intégrité et de sa réputation artistique plutôt que de sa résistance à l'autorité d'un régime étranger. /// Ein Vergleich von Giuseppe Bagettis Landschaftsskizzen, Aquarellen, Ölbildern und Druckgraphiken mit zeitgenössischen Karten und der erhaltenen realen Landschaft zeigt, dass bei der Entstehung von Bagettis Landschaftsdarstellungen eine Variante der Ereignisgeschichte eine Rolle spielte, die in seinem Werk zu anderen Ergebnissen führte als bei kartographischen und anderen künstlerischen Darstellungen. Die Vergleiche zeigen auch, dass dabei aussagestarke Bilder entstanden, die die Geschichte der erfolgreichen Eroberungen besser transportierten als es mit den Mitteln der Kartographie möglich war. In diesem Beitrag werden Bagettis Darstellungen der Oberitalienischen Feldzüge Napoleons, die er zwischen 1802 und 1809 anfertigte, kritisch gewürdigt. Seine Darstellungen waren weder pazifistisch noch Ausdruck eines Piemontesischen Patriotismus, sondern Bagetti folgte bei der Konzeption seiner Landschaftsdarstellungen der von offizieller französischer Seite bevorzugten Sichtweise der Geschichte der Eroberungen. Seine Grundlagen bildeten formelle schriftliche Instruktionen der zentralen kartographischen Einrichtung, des Dépôt de la guerre in Paris, sowie mündliche und schriftliche Anweisungen durch Bagettis unmittelbaren Vorgesetzten, Jean François Martinel. Darüber hinaus erhielt er Briefe, die vom Kommandanten des Dépôt de la guerre an ihn persönlich gerichtet waren. Bei sorgfältiger Auswertung dieser Korrespondenz und dem Vergleich seiner Gemälde mit der erhaltenen realen Landschaft und den zeitgenössischen Karten wird deutlich, dass es bei Bagettis Auseinandersetzungen mit seinen Vorgesetzten mehr um Fragen seiner künstlerischen Integrität und Reputation ging als um den Widerstand gegen die Autorität eines fremden Regimes. /// Una comparación de los bocetos de paisajes, aguadas, óleos y grabados de Giuseppe Bagetti con mapas contemporáneos y con el paisaje existente, revela que en la creación paisajística de Bagetti la narrativa jugó un papel diferente de las representaciones cartográficas y artísticas. La comparación también demuestra que sus imágenes eran poderosas construcciones que reflejaban una narrativa de famosas conquistas de manera más acertada de lo que era posible a través de la cartografía. Este artículo ofrece un examen crítico de las representaciones de las campañas napoleónicas en el norte de Italia, que Bagetti dibujó y pintó entre 1802 y 1809. Las pinturas de Bagetti no fueron ni pacifistas ni una expresión del patriotismo piamontés, sino que fueron inspiradas y construidas de acuerdo a una narrativa sobre la conquista que reflejaba el punto de vista de las autoridades francesas. La narrativa encontró su expresión en instrucciones formales escritas desde el centro cartográfico del Dépôt de la Guerre en Paris, en instrucciones verbales y escritas del inmediato superior de Bagetti, Jean François Martinel y en cartas personales dirigidas a Bagetti por el oficial que mandaba el Dépôt. Queda claro, a través de una cuidadosa lectura de la correspondencia y de la comparación de las pinturas de Bagetti con el paisaje actual y con los mapas de su tiempo, que las disputas de Bagetti con su supervisor se centraban en proteger su integridad artística y su reputación más que en resistirse a la autoridad de un régimen extranjero.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history.

Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension. Das äusserst schnelle Fortschreiten des Patchworksritus in den Vereinigten Staaten lässt sich durch diese zwei Aufgaben and durch die Wiederaneignung von Grundsymbolen der amerikanischen Einbildungswelt erklären. Durch die Wiederaneignung eines gemeinen Symbols legitimiert und reintegriert der Quilt die homosexuelle Gemeinschaft, die das Projekt trägt, in eine Gesellschaft, die sie zurückgeworfen hat.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii. Purtînd mǎrcile subiecti viaţii naratorului şi a unei ideologii personale aceste texte sunt în acelaşţi timp naraţiuni şi o formǎ de a depune mǎrturie. Ele dezvoltǎ deci o retoricǎ specialǎ prin care faptul trǎit se transformǎ în fapt povestit şi se comunicǎ unui interlocutor. Analia acestei retorici necesitǎ cunoaşterea discursurilor prin care evenimentul ne parvine, a condiţiilor în care s-a desfǎşurat ancheta, compararea povestirilor între ele pentru a constata apropierile diferenþele şi mai ales diferitele tipuri de focalizǎri. Acestea din urmǎ ne permit sa sesizǎm ce e mai important pentru cel ce povesteşte şi de ce. Pentru a ilustra aceasta problematicǎ ne-am oprit la tema identitǎţii şi alţeritǎţii, încercînd sǎ urmǎrim constelatiile idéologice şi culturale sub semnul cǎrora stau expansiunile ei in texte, criteriile prin care Celǎlalt este identificat şi prezentat. Through the study of the life stories told by the Romanian peasants of Banat and Oltenie, who were deported during the 1950s to the plain of Baragan, this article attempts to show how such biographical accounts can serve to reveal an ethno-historical and anthropological reality.We begin by underlining the methodological problems that such studies pose for the researcher. We discuss the discursive status of these accounts as a discourse intended to bear witness and the implications of this status for an analysis as a narrative and argumentative text, generating its own specific rhetoric. Along with an account of how this oral enquiry was carried out, it also seemed necessary to give a description of the historical context to which these accounts refer, in order to draw attention to the theme of identity and difference in the accounts given. The analysis of this theme required that due attention be paid do the ideological and symbolic constellations that surround it, in the criteria that the peasants use to differentiate the Other, in his or her multifarious guises. The examination of these factors offers several interesting lines of enquiry on cultural practices and mentalities, and on those in particular which relate to the household, the family and culinary habits. Indem wir die Lebensgeschichten der rumänischen Bauern aus Banat und Oltenie studierten, die in den fünfziger Jahren in die Ebene von Baragan vertrieben wurden, versuchten wir, herauszustellen, wie die Lebensgeschichte eine volksgeschichtliche und anthropologische Wirklichkeit ans Licht stellen kann. Wir haben das methodologische Problem betont, die sich für den Forscher aus derartigen Studie ergibt. Zuerst haben wir den erzählerischen Status der Lebenserzählung als Zeugnisrede erörtert, sowohl als auch die Folgen, die sich daraus ergeben, wenn sie als erzählender und argumentierender Text analysiert werden soll, der eine spezifische Rhetorik entwickelt. Eine Schilderung des historischen Zusammenhangs, worauf sich die Texte beziehen, und der Umstände, unter denen die mündliche Befragung sich abspielte, kam uns als notwendig vor, um die Bedeutung des Themas der Identität und des Unterschieds in den Erzählungen unserer Gesprächspartner hervorzuheben. In der Analyse dieses Themas nahmen wir die ideologischen und symbolischen Konstellationen in Kauf, die in den Textstellen vorherrschend sind, wo die Kriterien dargelegt werden, die die Bauern benutzen, um sich von dem Anderen unter seinen verschiedenen Gesichten zu unterscheiden. Die Analyse dieser Faktoren legt uns interessante Forschungswege nahe, die es erlauben, manche Denkweisen und kulturelle Verhaltensweisen herauszuheben, und zwar insbesondere diejenigen, die mit dem Heim -, Familienleben und Kochsitten verbunden sind.<br>

Abstract: L'expérience professionnelle et humaine de Giovanni Falcone, le juge instructeur du plus spectaculaire procès intenté contre la mafia, nous amène à examiner les relations entre l'enquête judiciaire et l'enquête ethnographique : car c'est grâce à l'instruction du Maxiprocesso (1986) qu'aujourd'hui nous disposons d'une abondante moisson de données sur Cosa Nostra, son fonctionnement, ses règles internes et son code d'honneur. Si la reconstruction d'une vérité au moyen d'indices, dans un monde protégé par l'omertà, apparente les techniques d'investigation du juge au modèle épistémologique qui est au fondement des sciences humaines depuis le XIXe siècle, l'utilisation d'informateurs appartenant à l'univers mafieux — les repentis — est à mettre en parallèle plus directement avec les méthodes de l'ethnographie. The human and professional experience of Giovanni Falcone, the examining magistrate in the most spectacular legal operation launched against the Mafia, makes us examine the relations between the judicial and the ethnographic investigation, for it is due to the inquiries of the Maxiprocesso (1986) that we now possess an abundant source of data on the Cosa Nostra, its operation, its internal rules and its code of honour. While, in a world protected by the omertà, the re-establishment of facts by means of evidence places the investigative techniques of the judge among those of the epistemological model, basis of the human sciences since the 19th century, the use of informers — the pentiti — from the world of the Mafia, on the other hand, reflects more directly the methods of ethnography. Das berufliche und menschliche Erfahrenheit des Untersuchungsrichters Giovanni Falcone im spektakulärsten aller jemals gegen die Mafia durchgeführten Prozesse führt uns zu einer Überprüfung der Beziehungen zwischen gerichtlicher und ethnographischer Untersuchung, denn dank der Voruntersuchung im Maxiprocesso (1986) verfügen wir heute über eine umfangreiche Sammlung von Angaben über die Cosa Nostra, über ihre Arbeitsweise, ihre inneren Regeln und ihren Ehrenkodex. In einer durch die Omertà geschützten Welt gleicht die Vorgehensweise des Richters bei der Aufdeckung der Wahrheit dem epistemologischen Modell, das den Humanwissenschaften seit dem 19. Jahrhundert zugrunde liegt, während die Verwendung von Informanten aus dem Bereiche der Mafia — den Pentiti — sich eher mit den Methoden der Ethnographie vergleichen lässt.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, zeigen die Bedeutung dieser neuen Episode der bewegten Geschichte des Palasts Porte Dorée. Aus dem dreifachem Gesichtspunkt der musealen Institution, des Personals und des Publikums ermöglichen diese Erhebungen, die Schliessung eines dem nationalen Erbe gehörenden Museums und sein neues Schicksal zu verstehen. Die Studie konzentriert sich auf die anscheinend widersprüchliche Verbindungen zwischen Bruch und Kontinuität, Schliessung und Fortdauer, Schwerfälligkeit der Vergangenheit und neuem Blick auf die Museen. Die baldige Schöpfung eines internationalen Zentrums der Geschichte der Einwanderung illustriert diese Paradoxe.<br>

Abstract: Entrepris depuis un quart de siècle, le démantèlement de l'industrie lourde lorraine (mines et sidérurgie) touche à sa fin. À partir de la comparaison entre le dernier événement en date, la fermeture spectaculaire de la dernière mine de charbon, et la mise en scène, une décennie plus tôt, de la dernière coulée d'une usine de la Lorraine sidérurgique, l'auteur s'interroge sur les finalités patrimoniales de telles célébrations. Présentant quelques moments du traitement culturel — patrimonial, mémoriel... — de la crise industrielle lorraine, depuis les symptômes photographiques d'une mémoire empêchée jusqu'au musée très « contrôlé » en passant par la monumentalisation controversée de restes industriels, il met l'accent sur la lutte des représentations qui se noue autour de la construction de la « Lorraine industrielle » en objet-frontière patrimonial. Cet article souhaite ainsi contribuer à une anthropologie politique de l'institution de la mémoire. The dismantling of the heavy industry in Lorraine that is under way since a quarter of century (mines and iron and steel industry) is nearing its end. When comparing the latest event — the spectacular closure of the last coalmine — with the staging of the last casting in an iron and steel factory of Lorraine ten years earlier the author questions about the patrimonial aims of such celebrations. He shows some sequences of the cultural treatment (patrimonial, memorial) of the industrial crisis in Lorraine, from the photographic « symptoms » of a hindered memory to the highly « controlled » museum and to the industrial remains turned into historic buildings, a largely controversial fact. In this context he stresses the conflicting representations of « industrial Lorraine » as a patrimonial Boundary Object (abstract or concrete, that several actors can appropriate as they like). This article is meant to contribute to a political anthropology of memory institution. Die Zerschlagung der lothringischen Schwerindustrie (Bergwerken und Eisen- und Stahlindustrie) geht zu Ende. Der Autor vergleicht das jüngste Ereignis, die spektakuläre Schliessung der letzten Kohlenbergwerks, mit der Inszenierung des letzten Giessens einer lothringischen Eisenhütte zehn Jare früher und fragt sich über die patrimonialen Finalitäten solcher Zelebrationen. Er zeigt einige Zeitpunkte der kulturellen Behandlung der lothringischen industriellen Krise (bezüglich des Erbes und Gedächtnisses), von den photographischen Symptomen eines verhinderten Gedächtnisses über die industriellen Resten, die nun unter dem Denkmalschutz stehen, was sehr umstritten wird, bis hin zu dem höchst « kontrollierten » Museum. In diesem Kontext hebt er die Kämpfe hervor, die um die Repräsentationen der Konstruktion des « industriellen » Lothringens als ein patrimoniales (abstraktes oder konkretes) « Grenzobjekt » entstanden, das sich mehrere Akteure nach Belieben aneignen können. Das Ziel dieser Artikel ist, zu einer politischen Anthropologie der Gedächtnisinstitution einen Beitrag zu leisten.<br>

Abstract: La plongée sous-marine en milieu naturel est une activité qui modifie l'équilibre et la perception du corps. Les plongeurs – souvent convaincus de pratiquer une activité sans danger – s'exposent pourtant à des risques potentiellement mortels. À partir d'une enquête ethnographique, l'auteur montre qu'en définitive ce sport laisse une place aux transgressions des normes où le risque est progressivement converti en sécurité. Cet arrangement implique d'acquérir la maîtrise des « techniques de neutralisation ­­» du risque, permettant aux plongeurs d'entretenir paradoxalement un système normatif, tout en le « violant ». Il apparaît ainsi que la transgression des normes de sécurité est moins un acte individuel qu'une conduite déterminée par l'organisation sociale de la plongée. Diving in a natural medium modifies the equilibrium and perception of the body. Divers — often convinced to practice a safe activity — expose themselves to potentially mortal risks. On the basis of an ethnographic survey the author shows that this sport leaves room for an infringement of norms where risk is progressively neutralized. This implies that divers master the neutralization techniques that enable them paradoxically to maintain a normative system and to violate it at the same time. Infringement of safety norms thus appears to be an individual act rather than a behaviour determined by the divers' social organization. Der Tauchsport in einem natürlichen Medium verändert das Equilibrium und die Wahrnehmung des Körpers. Die Taucher — die oft davon überzeugt sind, dass sie einen risikolosen Sport treiben — setzen sich potentiell tödlichen Risiken aus. Auf der Basis eiener ethnographischen Studie zeigt der Autor, dass dieser Sport Platz für eine Übertretung der Normen lässt, wo das Risiko allmählich neutralisiert wird. Dies setzt voraus, dass die Taucher die Neutralisationstechniken beherrschen, die sie paradoxerweise ermöglichen, ein normatives System zu erhalten und zur gleicher Zeit zu verletzen. Es zeigt sich, dass die Übertretung der Sicherheitsnormen eher eine individuelle Handlung als ein von der sozialen Organisation der Taucher bedingtes Verhalten ist.<br>

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten. Sie hilft dazu, den Unterschied zwischen Gruppennormen und individualen Normen hervorzuheben.<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine le concept de la performativité du don dans une communauté côtière ethniquement diversifiée, composée majoritairement d'autochtones sames et de Norvégiens. Inspirée par Mauss puis par Ricœur, l'auteure avance l'idée que la pratique du don revêt une importance capitale dans ces territoires isolés et peut être vue comme facteur d'émergence d'un sentiment de communauté et d'identité. Le don devient un acte performatif de relations et d'ethnicité, et une manière d'aborder la situation postcoloniale dans la région. This article addresses the performativity of the gift in an ethnically mixed coastal community, the population being predominantly indigenous Saami and Norwegian. Taking inspiration from Mauss and later Ricœur, my argument is that giving is highly important in these remote areas and can be seen as a way of creating community as well as identity. The gift becomes an act of performing relations as well as ethnicity and a way of approaching the postcolonial situation in the region. Das Konzept der Performativität des Gebens innerhalb einer ethnisch gemischten Gemeinschaft (Norweger und Samen) an der Küste Norwegens steht im Mittelpunkt dieses Artikels. Inspiriert durch die Theorien von Mauss und Ricœur verfolgt der Autor die Idee, dass das Geben eine wichtige Funktion in isolierten Gemeinschaften übernimmt und zum Aufkommen eines Gefühls von Gemeinschaft und Identität beiträgt. Das Geben wird zu einem performativen Akt unter den Ethnien und zu einer Mittel mit der postkolonialen Situation der Region umzugehen. Artikkelen adresserer gavens performativitet i etniske sammensatte kystsamfunn bestående av samisk og norsk befolkning. Inspirert av Mauss og Ricœur blir det argumentert for at å gi gaver ; er viktig i disse samfunnene og kan ses som konstituerende i forhold til både fellesskap og identitet. Gavebytte er handlinger som relasjoner gjøres gjennom og adresserer etnisk ambivalens, i tillegg til à være tilnærmingsmåter til den postkoloniale situasjon i region.<br>

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung fordert von der brasilianischen Regierung und Gesellschaft die Anerkennung der schlechten Lebensbedingungen unter denen die Menschen seit der Abschaffung der Sklaverei leben. Sie verlangen ebenso die Einbeziehung der ehemaligen Sklaven in den gesellschaftlichen, wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Prozess sowie die Anerkennung des Rassismus, dem Afro-Brasilianer noch immer zum Opfer fallen. Die derzeitige Rechtsprechung scheint eine tatsächliche Gleichheit zu fördern und trägt so zur Entwicklung eines zunehmend positiven Bildes der afro-brasilianischen Kultur bei.<br>

Abstract: Le combat juif pour la mémoire du génocide et la reconnaissance finalement obtenue sont devenus un modèle et un cadre référentiel pour d'autres populations persécutées. Mais l'ampleur de cette effervescence mémorielle suscite à son tour des réactions critiques. Quant au modèle, il est parfois contesté de façon virulente par la dérive minoritaire d'une compétition victimaire. Après avoir rappelé le processus à travers lequel ce phénomène mémoriel s'est progressivement imposé, on analysera son rôle référentiel, les critiques qu'il soulève et les controverses dont il fait l'objet. The Jewish fight for the genocide's memory and the recognition it eventually reached have become a model and a referential frame for other persecuted people. Yet in return some react critically to this rising memorial effervescence. As victims compete and minorities conflict, the Shoah model is in itself more and more contested. This article retraces how this memorial phenomenon has progressively settled and analyses its referential, yet controversial, role. Der jüdische Kampf um eine kollektive Erinnerung an die Vernichtung und ihre letztliche Anerkennung sind im Laufe der Zeit zu einer Art Modell und zu einem Bezugsrahmen für andere verfolgte Bevölkerungsgruppen geworden. Jedoch erzeugt die Omnipräsenz der Erinnerungen vielfach auch Kritik. Das Erinnerungsmodell wird von Seiten bestimmter Minderheitenströmungen innerhalb des herrschenden « Opferwettbewerbs » oftmals heftig angegriffen. Zunächst analysiert dieser Artikel den Prozess der Durchsetzung des Phänomens des Sich-Erinnerns, im Anschluss daran wird seine Referenzwirkung diskutiert sowie die Kritik und die Debatte die es hervorruft.<br>

Abstract: Rappelant la spécificité occidentale des valeurs historiques et commémoratives liées au temps « décimal » tel l'an 2000, l'article s'interroge sur des échéances temporelles dont la portée se trouve massivement amplifiée par le tourisme, les médias, les sites Internet, et une attente millénariste qui les transforme en reflet des fautes de l'Occident et des technologies. Des auteurs tels que Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao mettent en avant le temps vécu et reconnaissent que les cultures interagissent avec le temps pour produire des valeurs symboliques qui reflètent leurs propres choix. Aujourd'hui cependant il semble nécessaire de reconnaître la fracture du temps de l'historicisme et de l'humanisme de De Martino, et d'accepter des modalités plurielles et hétérogènes de la pensée, de l'expérience temporelle. The article recalls the Western specificity of historical and commemorative values related to « decimal » time, such as the year 2000. It questions about deadlines the consequences of which are massively amplified by tourism, medias, Internet sites and millenarist waiting and turned into a reflection of Western faults and technologies. Authors such as Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao are interested in the time lived and admit that cultures use time to produce symbolic values reflecting their own choices. But today it seems necessary to acknowledge time fracture in De Martino's historicism and humanism and to accept plural and heterogenous modalities of thought and temporal experience. Der Artikel erinnert an die mit der Dezimalzeit, wie dem Jahr 2000, verbundene westliche Spezifizität der geschichtlichen und Gedenkwerte, und fragt sich über Terminen deren Tragweite massenweise durch den Tourismus, die Medien, das Internet und das Warten auf das Millenium verstärkt wird, die sie in die Spiegelung der westlichen Fehler und Technologien verwandeln. Autore wie Ricœur, De Martino, Marramao interessieren sich fur die gelebte Zeit und erkennen an, dass die Kulturen die Zeit gebrauchen, um symbolische Werte zu produzieren, die ihre eigene Wahlen widerspiegeln. Doch scheint es heute notwendig, den sozialen Zeitbruch von De Martino's Historizismus und Humanismus anzuerkennen und die pluralen und heterogenen Modalitäten des Denkens und der zeitlichen Erfahrung anzunehmen.<br>

Abstract: L'idée de laïcité n'est pas soustraite à l'histoire. C'est pourquoi il est illusoire de postuler son sens dans l'absolu. Aujourd'hui, comme en d'autres époques, sa valeur politique tend à se polariser sur une opposition binaire entre une acception libérale et une acception anti-libérale dite républicaine. Toutefois, trois traits semblent particuliers aux années 1990 : — une disjonction entre l'acception politique dominante de la laïcité et sa force juridique, gagée par la Constitution et cadrée par des instruments juridiques internationaux ; — l'orientation nationalitaire du débat, pointant vers les populations issues de l'immigration musulmane, et questionnant leur appartenance à la nation ; — enfin, l'inscription du débat dans la problématique globale de la modernisation des formes scolaires, laquelle véhicule à la fois une epistemologie constructiviste et interactionniste, et une éthique laïque ef libérale. Les « affaires de foulards » sont un analyseur de cette complexité. Secularity concept must not be taken away from history. So it would be illusory to think about it as an abstract notion. Presently, as in older times, its political value tends to be focusing on a binary opposition between a liberal notion and an anti-liberal, so-called republican one. However three characteristics are specific of the nineties : — the split between main political meaning of secularity and its strength in legal terms, provided by the Constitution and by international legal tools ; — a debate focusing on nationality issues, with questions related to national belonging or muslim immigrants ; — last, the integration of this debate into the global issue of school modernization, which is concerned with a constructivist and interactionist epistemology and a liberal, secular ethic, as well. « Headscarves cases » are an indicator of this complexity.<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's libertarian ideals into a political agenda; secondly, an attempt to change to solid state with the 1989's Orientation Act (act laying down the basic principles for government action in education) and the creation of the "Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective" (assessment & futurology office); finally, the destabilisation of this system by Claude Allègre, the then French education secretary who put the French educational system into the picture of international competition. A period of doubts "under influence" followed right after. Es handelt sich darum, mehrere in den letzten 30 Jahren vorgefundenen Verwandlungen aufzuklären: zunächst die Gründung eines Expertenmilieus zwischen Politik, Verwaltung und Forschung. Dann einen Wandel des Rahmens, in dem die Überlegung stattfindet: es geht nämlich weniger darum, über den Zusammenhalt einer Gesellschaft in einem internationalen Rahmen nachzudenken als über die Art und Weise zu überlegen, wie das Land seinen Platz im internationalen Wettbewerb behalten kann. Schließlich einen Wandel der politischen Orientierung: die Bemühung um die Bildung einer Elite wird wieder vorrangig, auch wenn es nicht mehr darauf ankommt, eine kulturelle Tradition zu behalten, sondern seinen Marktanteil zu retten. Der Text bearbeitet diese Entwicklungen in Frankreich und unterscheidet dabei drei Perioden: erstens eine Zeit der „gasförmigen” Politik, in der die Linksparteien versuchen, die anarchistischen 1968er Ideale in ein Regierungsprogramm umzusetzen; zweitens ein Versuch der Verfestigung mit dem Orientierungsgesetz 1989 und die Gründung des Bewertungs- und Forschungsamtes (Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective); drittens eine Destabilisierung dieses Systems durch den Erziehungsminister Claude Allègre, der das französische Schulsystem mit der internationalen Konkurrenz konfrontiert. Darauf folgt eine „unter Einfluß" stehende und zugleich unsichere Periode. Se trata de aclarar varios desplazamientos que se produjeron en los treinta últimos años. Primero, la creación de un medio de expertos intermediarios entre la política, la administración y investigación. Después, un cambio del marco dentro del que se sitúa la reflexión. No se trata tanto de pensar la cohesión de una sociedad en un marco nacional como de la manera en que el país puede mantener su rango en la competencia internacional. Por fin, un cambio de orientación política : la preocupación por la formación de lo más selecto vuelve a ser primordial aunque ya no se trata de mantener una tradición cultural sino de proteger sus cuotas de mercado. El texto estudia estas evoluciones en Francia distinguiendo tres períodos : un período de « política en estado gaseoso » en el que la izquierda intenta transformar los ideales libertarios de 1968 en programa de gobierno ; un intento de pasar al estado sólido con la ley de orientación de 1989 y la creación la Dirección de la evaluación y de la prospectiva ; una destabilización de este sistema por el ministro Claude Allègre que echa el sistema educativo francés en el gran baño de la competencia internacional. De ahí resulta un período a la vez «bajo influencia » y de incertidumbre.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y reivindicaciones que recientemente han sido avivados por los usos públicos y políticos de la historia y de la memoria. La historia escolar admite la historia pero no las memorias como saber de referencia legítimo; sin embargo las conmemoraciones y el "deber de memoria" se invitan cada vez más frecuentemente. Tales evoluciones interrogan los componentes de la asignatura escolar: las finalidades identitarias y cívicas, los contenidos y sus renovaciones, las prácticas, desigualmente conocidas en este campo, y finalmente los aprendizajes a menudo más esperados que comprobados. Das Verhältnis zwischen Geschichte und Gedächtnis in der Schule ist komplex und mehrdeutig. Es gibt den Anlass zu Debatten und Forderungen, die die öffentlichen und politischen Anwendungen des Gedächtnisses und der Geschichte neulich haben aufleben Tassen. Die Schulgeschichte duldet die Geschichte aber nicht die Erinnerungen als Maßstab gebendes Wissen, während Gedenkfeier und "Erinnerungsgebot'' (Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit) immer öfter daran teilhaben. Eine solche Entwicklung stellt die Komponenten des Schulfachs Geschichte in Frage: über seine Zwecke, was die Identitätsfrage und den Bürgersinn betrifft, über den Inhalt und seine Veränderungen, über Praktiken, die in diesem Gebiet oft ungenügend bekannt sind, und schließlich über das tatsächliche Erlernen, das oft eher erhofft als erwiesen ist.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Abstract: Hegel ist als Philosoph des Systems bekannt. Sein System aber unterscheidet sich von denen, die Walter Benjamin in seiner "Erkenntniskritischen Vorrede" zum "Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels" kritisierte. Was Hegel avisierte, war nicht ein Netz von Begriffen als neutralen Instrumenten der Weltbeziehung und Welterschließung. Das ist eher das Entfalten seines Systems selbst, das die Welt, die Geschichte, und die Weltgeschichte konstituiert. Dadurch sind wir berechtigt, seine Philosophie als ein performatives Projekt zu analysieren, das in dem Sinne auch zur Literatur gehören kann. Hegels Gedicht "Eleusis" vermittelt uns die immanenten Konflikte und Widersprüchlichkeit seines eigenen Diskurses (das Unaussprechliche auszusprechen) und sanktioniert sich performativ; Phänomenologie des Geistes ist nicht nur eine Galerie von Bildern/Gestalten und eine selbstbehauptende Konstruktion, sondern auch eine Verarbeitung von Hegels eigenen literarischen Erfahrungen, sei es in der Dichtung ("Eleusis"), Tragödie (Antigone-Übersetzung), oder Formen des Essays/Fragments ("Wer denkt abstrakt?").<br>

Abstract: At present there is under utilization of maternity service provision in Nigeria, with only a third of childbearing women electing to deliver in healthcare facilities. This is relevant since Nigeria's maternal mortality rate is second highest in the world and is estimated at 1,100 per 100,000 live births. To date, studies have sought cause and effect and have neglected the opinion of the people about what they perceive to be problematic and what they believe constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision. An exploratory qualitative study was carried out to identify pregnant women in a rural Niger Delta community's perceptions of conventional maternity service provision. Participants included 8 pregnant Niger Delta women from differing sub-groups within the homogeneous population. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore informants' views of what constitutes satisfactory maternity service provision, what comprises inadequate care, barriers that obstruct delivery of maternity care, and what promotes positive outcomes. Five major themes emerged from the data. These included: (1) Women's requirements for information; (1a) nutritional and dietary advice, (1b) how to recognise developing complications, (1c) appropriate fetal development, (1e) importance of attending clinics; (2) Staff services required: (2a) availability, (2b) well managed, and (2c) good quality; (3) Apparatus: (3a) equipment available, (3b) adequate infrastructure; (4) Affordability; (5) Place of traditional and spiritual methods. The interviewed childbearing Niger Delta women voiced several factors that they considered altered their satisfaction with maternity service provision. Finding out more about what causes satisfaction/dissatisfaction in childbearing women facilitates maternity care professionals to improve standards of care and allocate resources more effectively. Policy changes are driven by initiatives that reinforce strengths of current specification and recognise weaknesses. In addition, the WHO recommends that working towards improving health related culture is important. A l'heure actuelle, il y a une sous utilisation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux au Nigeria, étant donné qu'un tiers des femmes en âge de procréer optent pour accoucher dans des établissements de santé. Les études antérieure ont recherché la cause et l'effet et ont négligé les opinions des femmes concernant ce qu'elles croient être la bonne prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux. Nous avons mené une étude qualitative exploratrice pour identifier 8 femmes enceintes à partir des perceptions d'une communauté rurale du Niger Delta à l'égard de la prestation de services de gynécologie-obstétricaux conventionnels. Des interviews semi-structures ont exploré les opinions des enquêtées sur ce qui constitue la prestation de services de gynécologieobstétricaux satisfaisant, ce qui constitue les soins insuffisants, les obstacles qui entravent la prestation de soins de gynécologieobstétricaux et ce qui avance les résultats positifs. Cinq thèmes importants ont émergé à partir des données : (i) Les besoins des femmes pour les renseignements ; 1a) le conseil nutritionnel et alimentaire, 1b) comment reconnaître des complications qui se préparent, 1c) le développement approprié des fétus, le) la nécessité de fréquenter les cliniques, 2) bien gérer, 2c) la bonne qualité 3) appareil 3a) l'équipement disponible, 3b) l'infrastructure adéquate ; 4) s'ils sont abordables ; 5) la place des méthodes traditionnelles et spirituelles. Les femmes enquêtées ont mentionné plusieurs facteurs qui ont modifié leur satisfaction avec la prestation de service de gynécologie-obstétricaux. La recherche supplémentaire concernant les causes de la satisfaction ou du mécontentement rend facile la tâche des professionnels de soins de maternité leur permettant d'améliorer la qualité de soin et d'affecter des ressources plus efficacement.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: This paper links the ideas of Norbert Elias to the conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that has developed in British industrial and organisational (I/O) sociology. It examines the relevance of power and subjectivity to British I/O sociology and reviews theoretical positions that have influenced this field. Elias's work is examined in some detail, exploring his approach to power, agency, the self, individualisation and discourse. His work is then applied to a re-examination of the perspectives on power and subjectivity contained within labour process, Foucauldian and actor network theory. The paper attempts to show how Elias's work re-frames our understanding of power and subjectivity through a stress on interdependencies and their asymmetry, the 'networked' nature of agency, and the interwoven form of human and socio-political development. It argues that Eliasian analysis maintains the critical concern with power asymmetries witnessed in labour process theory, yet avoids some of the difficulties in conceptualisation of power and subjectivity that are apparent in labour process, Foucauldian work and actor network theory. Elias's work also illustrates the need for a lengthier historical perspective than is typically observed in industrial and organisational sociology, and points to the value of studies which look beyond the context of the workplace. Finally, attention is paid to some of the limitations of Elias's work.<br>

Abstract: La personnalité, l'activité et l'œuvre de Gonseth peuvent être interprétés organiquement dans une instructive pédagogie de dialogue. L'auteur évoque a) la structure dialogale intime de Gonseth, b) les dialogues peu fructueux qu'il a entretenus avec le Cercle de Vienne, puis lors des Entretiens de Zurich, c) les dialogues qu'il a imaginés dans Les mathématiques et la réalité entre trois personnages: Parfait, Sceptique et Idoine, auxquels vient s'ajouter à la fin le Nouvel Idoine, d) les rencontres avec les néo-scolastiques à Rome, e) la «doctrine» explicite du dialogue exposée dans La loi du dialogue. L'auteur s'interroge aussi sur les conditions d'un dialogue fécond et sur les obstacles qui peuvent s'y opposer, (en particulier: l'incompatibilité des référentiels). Gonseth the man, his life and his work can be interpreted organically in an instructive account of dialogue. The author treats the following topics: a) Gonseth's intimate dialogical structure, b) the fruitless dialogues he had with the Vienna Circle and then at the Entretiens de Zurich, c) his imaginary dialogues in Les mathématiques et la réalité between the characters Perfect, Sceptic and Appropriate, and finally New Appropriate, d) his contacts with neo-scholastics at Rome, e) the explicit 'doctrine' of dialogue presented in La loi du dialogue. The article is also concerned with conditions for a fruitful dialogue and with obstacles that can stand in the way (in particular, the incompatibility of reference systems). Die Persönlichkeit, die Aktivitäten und das Werk Gonseths können im Rahmen einer lehrreichen Pädagogik des Dialogs einheitlich interpretiert werden. Der Autor erörtert a) die intime Dialogstruktur Gonseths; b) die wenig fruchtbaren Dialoge, die er mit dem Wiener Kreis und während der Zürcher Gespräche führte; c) die Dialoge dreier Figuren, die er in Les mathématiques et la réalité in Szene gesetzt hat: Perfekt, Skeptiker und Geeignet, zu denen sich am Schluss der Neue Geeignete hinzugesellt; d) die Begegnungen mit den Neo-Scholastikern in Rom; e) die explizite «Doktrin» des Dialogs, die in La loi du dialogue dargelegt ist. Der Aufsatz stellt auch die Frage nach den Bedingungen eines befruchtenden Dialogs und nach den Hindernissen, die sich ihm entgegenstellen können (im besonderen: die Inkompatibilität der Bezugsrahmen).<br>

Abstract: The study of the wider context of the rhetorical structure (as distinct from discrete rhetorical features) is proposed to apply to two areas: (1) the story and discourse, or signified and signifier, which concerns all matters in, and of, the text; and (2) the materiality of reading which concerns all matters presumably outside the text The polarity between text and textuality is explored at length in the five most important relations in which rhetorical features figure importantly.<br>

Abstract: Rousseau opposed both traditional and modern (empiricist) thinking when he made self-love the cornerstone of his system. Other modes of thought treat self-consciousness as constituted primarily by temporal desire. Rousseau raises love, for him the suspension of desire, to a position of ontological primacy in regard to self-consciousness. Like Pascal, he throws the empirical existence of the self into radical question and finds it to be as insubstantial and empty a concept as the Western tradition has found it-from Ecclesiastes and Socrates on. Rousseau declines the moralistic reproof of the self, however, and emphasizes its insubstantiality as its one strength, although a fictional one. The self exists only in the mode of a hypothesis (the fictional "as if"): it is a failure at being. But to amour (and to pitié) it makes all the difference and is worthy of their support.<br>

Author(s): Small Audrey<br>
Abstract: A book proposing an overview of “African literature” is a very attractive proposition to the new reader seeking orientation in a vast and fastgrowing vibrant field, to the expert in one area looking to explore others, and perhaps also to the publisher with a canny eye to the bottom line. This essay examines the often bewildering array of apparent subcategories that emerge in some key texts published around the turn of the twentieth-first century that purport to offer an overview of African literature in French, but which seem to entirely set aside important international debates over “postcolonial,” diaspora, and hybridity, among others. These texts have an important role in the construction of knowledge of “African literature,” but their strengths and limitations become clear when we look closely at the categories suggested and no more so than when the category happens to be that of “identity.”<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Author(s): Salmose Niklas<br>
Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: The point here is that whoever I am in terms of my personal identity and my capacity or incapacity to identify myself through sortal terms as a being in the world with others, I will have no doubt who is in pain or who will have the pain. Here, again, is a sense of “I” in which I can be aware of myself and refer to myself without it being necessary to employ any nonindexical or third-personal referents.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: To challenge an unexamined critical alignment with Ishmael's limited epistemology in Herman Melville's
         Moby-Dickshows how the placing of confidence in Ishmael as witness to Ahab's monomania leads to a misreading ofMoby-Dick. Ahab lies at the center of a highly developed epistemology that competes with and eludes the narrator's comprehension. The various trophies that appear throughout the text are manifest examples of this other-than-interpretive system of knowing, and Melville uses the act of possessing trophies, particularly the act of eating trophies, to show graphically how such a system works. In other words, Melville has developed a complex epistemological system of ingestion around Ahab to model how language can be materially invested with meaning and how that meaning is performed.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjtheophil.35.2.0093">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjtheophil.35.2.0093</a>

Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo se inicia refletindo sobre as várias maneiras que Gilberto Freyre usou o conceito-chave de mestiçagem e os campos culturais diferentes aos quais ele estendeu o seu uso — arquitetura, culinária, esporte, literatura, urbanismo, sociologia e até mesmo sexo. Chamando a atenção para os conceitos ou metáforas alternativas que se encontram na obra de Freyre — interpenetração, mistura, hibridismo, etc. — o artigo se volta para a discussão de uma metáfora que Freyre não usou, apesar de ter se tornado usual desde sua época: tradução cultural. Após uma breve história da idéia de tradução cultural, que inclui uma discussão de suas vantagens e desvantagens, o artigo termina com um estudo de caso de tradução tanto metafórica como cultural do conceito ocidental de liberdade para o Japão após a restauração imperial de 1868.<br>
