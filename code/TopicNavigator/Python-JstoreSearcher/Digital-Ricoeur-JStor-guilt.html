  The Pain of Poverty from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt7zw0w8">Women and Evil</a><br>
  Abstract: so far we have seen that evil became associated early with disobeying father and his representatives. The roots of that association stretch back into antiquity when early human beings felt contaminated by preexisting evil. Ricoeur began his study of the symbolism of evil with an analysis of defilement. Already two things have happened that must now set aside. First, evil is firmly associated with sin, guilt, impurity, and fault; there has been a move beyond pure terror to ethical terror. Second, thought already focuses on the symbol rather than the experience. “By beginning with a symbolism already there,” Ricoeur observes,<br>

  Author(s) Schwartz Barry<br>
  Abstract: To build on the words of Barry Schwartz, the destruction of the temple in 70 CE definitely “made a difference” for Flavius Josephus, who witnessed its eradication and recorded his memories shortly thereafter in Rome. Though his account of the conflict in
                  Jewish War(Bellum judaicum) was intended to set the Roman campaigns, especially those of the Flavians Vespasian and Titus, into the desired perspective, he focuses on the temple’s destruction, giving close attention to the matter of responsibility and thus weighing the question of war guilt. Josephus’s well-known answer to this problem is unambiguous: the Roman commanders were not<br>

  Abstract: St. Augustine begins his

  Abstract: This chapter seeks to offer a preliminary discussion of the recent turn to emotions in world politics. The first part of the chapter turns to the politics of emotionality, so as to shed light on how events helped to shape the descent to war in Kosovo and Chechnya. This is important because arguments put forward in theoretical circles, even by those deemed to be critical, often suggest that emotions and international politics pull in different directions. In order to demonstrate a different argument – that politics and emotions are entwined – the chapter turns to four interlinked themes; guilt and<br>

  Author(s) WINTER JAY<br>
  Abstract: In the wake of World War II, politicians and parents alike proclaimed that they had just endured “a war against children.” In the war’s aftermath, the consequences of Nazi violence, Allied air bombings, and family separations were most commonly presented in terms of the suffering endured by Europe’s youngest citizens.¹ While this concern for children was genuine and eminently reasonable, it also served a political agenda. This chapter therefore traces how the symbol of the child victim aggravated a case of formidable historical amnesia among postwar Europeans who preferred to divert attention from guilt and complicity toward the far more<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Following the Augustinian tradition, original sin is something that we are responsible for and hence guilty of, yet in another sense it is a destiny that befalls us. At stake is hence a fine balance between necessity and freedom, between personal guilt and delivery to destructive structures. Accordingly, acknowledging sin takes a personal sense of the I, confessing or revealing itself as the originator of deeds and speech, while acknowledging that this I is indebted—for better and for worse—to the inheritance of and continuous participation in a form of life that bestows coherence to those deeds and utterances.<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

  Author(s) HAKER HILLE<br>
  Abstract: In her reading of Walter Benjamin’s “Critique of Violence,” Judith Butler provides a persuasive interpretation of the critical resources Benjamin mobilizes. She points out that Benjamin draws on an alternative Jewish tradition of understanding the commandment “Thou shall not kill.” In her analysis, the commandment is opposed to a principle of guilt and hence can become the basis for a critique of legal violence. Moreover, according to Butler, the commandment, as Benjamin conceives of it, constitutes the condition for a theory of responsibility that would be fundamentally concerned with the ongoing struggle with nonviolence.

  Abstract: Anyone proposing to write yet another book about Jean-Paul Sartre must do so with a certain sense of guilt. Given the huge number of books and articles that already exist, what justification can there be for adding to them? Moreover, any writer on Sartre lives with the melancholy awareness that Sartre himself insisted that he had never learnt anything from any of the books written about him.¹ Yet such is the richness and complexity of Sartre’s work that there are still things that have not been said – as well, unfortunately, as some that have been said all too often,<br>

  Abstract: The Protestant missionary movement had a profound impact on China, but also left an unintended legacy in the West. Western missions guilt is an unanticipated backlash from the missionary movement, which still reverberates today. Did the missionary movement draw the missionaries inexorably into the imperial project and, thus, the sins of the West? Popular culture in America has castigated the missions movement for decades, and missions in America has seemed to be in a defensive mode. Although missions, particularly North American evangelical missions, continued to expand—with an estimated more than 110,000 American and Canadian long-term Protestant missionaries serving today—<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of ~<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir d~<br>

In his contemporary rendering, which is neither reverential homage nor postmodern deconstruction, Anderson offers an elegant, rigorous character study as well as a provocative reexamination of some of noir’s central philosophical, thematic, and visual motifs. Confronting universal moral issues—guilt and innocence, crime and punishment—raised by earlier crime dramas, the film investigates the possibilities of salvation within a traditionally treacherous cinematic realm.<br>

  Abstract: In this rigorous and imaginative study, Seligman seeks to discover a durable source of moral authority in a liberalized world. His study of shame, pride, collective guilt, and collective responsibility demonstrates the mutual relationship between individual responsibility and communal authority. Furthermore, Seligman restores the indispensable role of religious traditions--as well as the features of those traditions that enhance, rather than denigrate, tolerance. Sociologists, political theorists, moral philosophers, and intellectual historians will find Seligman's thesis enlightening, as will anyone concerned with the ethical and religious foundations of a tolerant society.<br>

                  Book of Joshua: “Because you erected an altar against God’s great and sacred word, tomorrow his anger will rage against all the people.” Peter’s own more prosaic words show that the<br>

  Author(s): TRAVERSO ENZO<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W. Adorno, and others, the intellectual historian Enzo Traverso explores the varying nature of left melancholy as it has manifested in a feeling of guilt for not sufficiently challenging authority, in a fear of surrendering in disarray and resignation, in mourning the human costs of the past, and in a sense of failure for not realizing utopian aspirations. Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Abstract: Responsibility is now a fashionable concept in political theory, philosophy, and critical theory, and,
                  ceteris paribus, that is a good reason not to write about it. Large bodies of work exist expounding its various connotations and meanings, ranging from questions of accountability and guilt to the need to respond to alterity. And yet there is something rather elusive about the political connotations of contemporary invocations of responsibility within the context of the turn to ethics in the humanities and social sciences, an elusiveness that at first glance seems largely due to hyperindividualized, abstract, and unhistorical thematizations of responsibility.

  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5.

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Duranti identifies three paradigms for the study of language in relation to culture as consecutive but coexisting within contemporary American anthropology, although his preference for the 1990s paradigm shift to social constructionism is never in doubt. My own experience confirms the existence of these paradigms, but I assess their consequences somewhat differently. As a graduate student in the late 1960s I suffered considerable guilt over my lack of interest in the descriptivelinguistics agenda, embracing a more theoretical model of language as symbolic form instantiated in social action. I agree with Duranti that the ethnography of communication of my professional generation sought autonomy from both anthropology and linguistics, but for me the line between his second and third paradigms remains blurred. From the beginning, I assumed that our attention to language would produce better sociocultural research and theory. As a teacher of anthropology and the sole linguist in my department, I opted for language and culture rather than descriptive linguistics in the single required semester course. My students assumed that all languages were written down and that someone would speak English anywhere they might carry out fieldwork. Language as handmaiden to ethnology had to earn its keep as a way of getting at the nature of social order rather than as a tool for dealing with linguistic diversity in the field.<br>

Abstract: Defense of the Puritans against charges of political insubordination became particularly urgent as
      The History of the Puritansmoved into its longest and most difficult period: the reign of Charles I, culminating in civil war, the execution of the king, and the rule of Cromwell. Eighteenth‐century Dissenters were still living with the legal disabilities that followed from their assumed guilt for these events. And to legitimize their call for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, they needed to question the dominant historical picture of these events. The bishop of London, Gibson, had commented to Zachary Grey in 1736 with some complacency, “surely neither he nor his friends can hope to gain credit to their cause, by a History of the State of Religion, and particularly the conduct of the Puritans, from 1642 to 1660.”33Neal moves into this period with some circumspection, but this is precisely his unavoidable aim: to go some way toward justifying the conduct of the Puritans in the civil war and under Cromwell.<br>

Abstract: It is fitting to conclude my speculations on the disruptiveness of localization to the race/gender/sexuality analogy by briefly examining Haraway’s analytics of race in
         Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium(1997a). Although the essay on race, “Race: Universal Donors in a Vampire Culture” (1997b), begins with a numbingly familiar series of analogies—“Race, like nature and sex, is replete with all kinds of rituals of guilt and innocence in the stories of nation, family, and species … race, like sex, is about the purity of lineage; the legitimacy of passage” (213)—the bulk of the essay derives its interpretive impetus from historically specific articulations. Through a table that periodizes twentieth‐century kinship categories through key objects of knowledge—race, population, and the genome—in three periods in the twentieth century, Haraway both contextualizes the categories of race, sex, and nature and suggests related discontinuities and unfamiliar connections along the chart by seeing the chart as a hypertext. The most insightful of Haraway’s observations derive from rigorous localized analysis. Thus Haraway demonstrates both the humanist impulse behind the Human Genome Project and the raced, colonial workings through which indigenous peoples were once again the objects of knowledge rather than partners in a research agenda (1997b, 249).<br>

Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: As stated in
         The Identity of Jesus Christ, the narrative set forth in the Gospels sets forth a Christian way of reading in which Jesus’s identity is understood as the conjunction of his enacted intention, the enacted intentions of God and others, and the circumstances in which he finds himself, including Israel’s history with God. The narrative of Christ’s life serves as a “summation” of Israel’s history, as scripturally narrated.42Jesus’s identity is thus the continuation, and intensification, of this history, and the narrative is of his making this history his own. Continually, however, such appropriation is shaped by Jesus’s obedience to God; his “identity” is thus found in his responsive actions, rather than his own intentionality. His obedience to God, as the unifying element of his character, integrates varied states of character and existence: “There is no power for salvation in such pre‐established, paradoxical qualities as helplessness and power, guilt and purity, either in themselves or apart from him. They become efficacious because they arehisand because he holds them together in the enactment of his obedience to God.”43<br>

Abstract: Addressed to finite beings, the selfless gift is constitutive of their singularity; it also condemns such singular beings to guilt inasmuch as they are responsible. Furthermore, the gift of responsibility that occurs in the
      mysterium tremendumis a gift by a self‐denying and self‐effacing Goodness, who also remains inaccessible because of its very withdrawal. To be responsible is, in Patočka’s words, to stand in an inscrutable relation to “a Person who sees into the soul without being itself accessible to view” and “in whose hands we are not externally, but internally” (HE,pp. 107, 106). That which makes me responsible is something that remains impenetrable to me—in other words, secret. It is also something that shatters me because I cannot adequately respond to such a self‐denying gift. Thus, Platonic responsibility is a function of what Patočka terms looking‐in, or looking‐into‐what‐is (nahlédnutí)—namely, into eternal being—which like the Platonic Good can effectively be known. Christian responsibility, however, is not in the power of the subject, who is overpowered, crushed by it precisely because its source—self‐renouncing and self‐withdrawing Goodness—remains unfathomable.14Finally, as Derrida puts it, the gift of responsibility is a gift by “a goodness whose inaccessibility acts as a command to the donee. It subjects its receivers, giving themselves to them as goodness itself but also as the law” (GD,p. 41)—that is, as a universality to which the donee is subject as a singular and irreplaceable being. As the result of this gift, Christian responsibility, therefore, takes the uniqueness and irreplaceability of the singular individual into account precisely by subjecting him to a universal Law.<br>

Article Title: Dickens and the Narratography of Closure<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: Through this notion of being‐for‐God, we can see more clearly how prayer functions in the above notebook entries. In 1810, Coleridge had argued that prayer mediated between conscience and action: this makes sense, as prayer attests and bears witness to one’s sense of responsibility to God. It is the act of recognizing the demand of conscience and answering it, even if the only human answer that is truly faithful and appropriate sometimes seems to be guilt itself, tangled in its very attitude toward the promise of grace: “Mercy! mercy!” (N6244, fol. 74v). In 1827, the terms in question are those of activity and passivity: how can the human will bend itself into accord with the divine will? The answer is that the “I” must wrestle with the narcissism of its own being in order to attest to its being‐for‐God. In prayer, the human subject can be both “agent” and “patient”—that is, one who acts freely as a self but through this very act recognizes and accepts the self as for another, even as a gift from that other. Hence, this is the heart of Coleridge’s philosophy of prayer: being for and before God, “turning your thoughts into acts by connecting them by an act with the idea of the Redeemer God.” In prayer, a phenomenological intentionality directed solely toward our sense of responsibility—“a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155)—can at least help orientate our being before and for God. This is why Coleridge can assert that in prayer alone is the life or will united with the idea of God (e.g., N5228, N5383) and why it can be a way out of the gnarled condition of sin. If one at least acknowledges one’s being‐for‐God, even if only in contemplating one’s abandonment of it in all other acts and intentionalities, then the economy of Christian salvation can be initiated: “O for the
         powerto cry out for mercy from the inmost / That would be Redemption!” (N3353).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: And just as the play solicits sympathy with Faustus in its spectacle and its comedy, so does it invite pity for Faustus in its tragedy. Such pity emerges from a slightly different kind of theatrical identification, however. Rather than accompanying the spectator's recognition that a character shares his or her interests, pity may arise when the spectator recognizes the character's otherness, when he apprehends or infers that the character suffers inwardly in an extraordinary way. Yet in pity the spectator also identifies in some sense with the tragic character, for he feels psychic pain in his imagination of the character's suffering. For Levinas, for instance, pity, as an expression of the subject's irreducibly asymmetrical obligation to the other, is fundamental to ethics.
      34But inDoctor Faustus, pity has no salutary ethical or moral value; on the contrary, the play explicitly contrasts the quality of human pity to that of divine mercy, thereby fashioning pity for Faustus as an aesthetic response that undermines the spectator's faith in God. It is the old man who thus devalues tragic pity. After Helen leaves the stage for the first time, the old man tells Faustus that an “angel” hovers over his head “with a vial full of precious grace” to “pour” into his “soul” (5.1.54–56), and he urges Faustus to repent—to “break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears” (5.1.40)—warning him that he has endangered his inward soul “with such flagitious crimes of heinous sins / As no commiseration may expel / But mercy, Faustus, of thy Savior sweet, / Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt” (5.1.43–46). “Commiseration” is, of course, the contemporaneous word for the pity inspired by tragedy; Sidney uses it as such inThe Defense of Poesy.35The old man argues, then, that Faustus is no less damnable for being pitiful, yet his argument, orthodox as it may be, not only makes God seem somehow less compassionate than even the crudest member of the audience moved by Faustus's ~<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: Three epigraphs circumscribe the book’s broader themes. The first, from the late philosopher Paul Ricoeur (LaCocque’s friend and collaborator), identifies the role of myth in combining the innocence and guilt of humanity. The second, from Norman Brown’s
      Life against Death, points out how “pyramids and skyscrapers” represent a “flight from death.” The third, from Jacques Derrida, characterizes the Tower of Babel as “an incompletion, the impossibility of finishing, of totalizing” (v). Taken together, these three reflections affirm an understanding of the Babel story as a timeless “symbol of all our constructions and fabrications, with their inexorable outcome: confusion (of our life messages) and scattering (of all the pieces of our projects)” (21). They also provide a model for LaCocque’s own scholarly practice, which is distinctively rigorous yet exploratory at the same time. If, for example, Genesis 11 dates from the exile, it then becomes possible to depict it as a mythic critique of architectural fetishism and political ambition. The “gate of the divine” (Bab-El) thus becomes a dangerous threshold from profane to sacred, one in which the desire to “make a name” reflects an arrogance doomed to confuse all names. As myth, Genesis 11 captures enduring tendencies in human psychology such as infants’ fascination with presence and absence (“fort” and “da”) and the politics of empire.<br>

Abstract: In the Ewe case evil spirits that are exorcized or delivered by Christians represent the full range of indigenous spiritual entities cast as afflicting agents, while priests and priestesses of Ewe deities honor them and offer remedies against other powers recognized as evil. The externalization of evil as a force to be engaged in spiritual warfare on a cosmic scale is particularly evident when the ethnographic setting is one simplified by the absence of missionary Christianity and witchcraft. This is the case in the practice of deliverance from evil spirits in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement in North America (Csordas
         1994). Here evil is represented in a highly elaborated demonology composed of spirits whose names are those of problematic thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that are beyond the control of individuals (e.g., Anger, Addiction, Bitterness, Rejection, Depression). As is the case among Christianized Ewe, in this conception of evil there is a decentering of agency and responsibility: diabolical evil originates outside the individual even though a person must to some degree collaborate with and consent to it; sin opens one to the influence of evil, and evil tempts one to sin. On the individual level, the language of Charismatic deliverance is that of affliction and healing rather than guilt and repentance, and on the cosmological level encounters with evil spirits are episodes in spiritual warfare between the forces of God and Satan.<br>

Abstract: But if Cordelia’s response is a revelation, it is an unwelcome one, for it interrupts the egotistical exercise the king is attempting to oversee. Her plainness upends everything by inverting in an instant the power relations that structure his contest. Having expended all his political capital to make himself the center of attention, Lear finds himself supplanted by a daughter whose powerlessness comprises a more compelling claim to that place. Her vulnerability speaks more loudly than his majesty, obliging him to attend to her. And in that moment of attention, Lear instantly knows himself to be a usurper, responsible to the one before him.
      
            Rather than respond with care, however, Lear responds with rage. His anger is quite obviously an evasion, an attempt to duck his responsibility by casting blame on Cordelia. As Sears Jayne remarks, Lear reacts with “that violence which characterizes the actions of people who are stung by the consciousness of their own guilt.”12
         
            The perverse logic of Lear’s passion goes something like this: “You have made me angry, so you must be in the wrong. Were I the offender, I would be feeling contrition. Instead, I am feeling outrage, which is the natural response to unjust treatment. Thus, the emotions you have made me feel prove that I am the victim here, the one to whom redress must be made.” In the palpable force of his anger, the king would validate his neglect of Cordelia, and the intensity of his ire is the measure of his self-betrayal, showing the lengths to which he must go to ignore the accountability he feels. Lear must crowd out his sense of responsibility with all-consuming anger if he is to persist on his selfish path.13<br>

Abstract: But whether he is right or wrong, Adam with these words frames the debate for both parties and for nearly all of the critical literature on Eve’s dream. At the center of that debate is this question of what exactly happened, the night before, in Eve’s mind. But in searching for the key to her spiritual condition in the dream space, we miss the profound importance of the fact that Eve does not and perhaps cannot yet articulate sin in her own person. It may be that her yet sinless vocal chords simply cannot form the words: “And I did eat.” As William Riggs writes, “Evil thoughts, in Adam’s famous assessment, ‘into the mind of God or Man / May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave / No spot or blame behind’ (V 117–19), but thoughts articulated—so Eve’s experience of her own words argues—constitute a significant gesture toward choice.”
      
               If Riggs is right then Eve’s famous ellipsis, far from inviting speculation, should end it altogether. What is often read as a clever evasion of guilt or at least a questionable coyness may in fact be the surest sign of abiding innocence. We need not speculate on what did or did not happen in Eve’s dreaming mind. The fact that she refuses to pronounce the incriminating words may be—to borrow another famous verse that may or may not belong in quotation marks—all we know and all we need to know.29<br>

Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Publisher: German Studies Association<br>
Issue: i262423<br>

Author(s): Jens-Fietje Benjamin<br>
Abstract: Hans Fallada has suffered from a poor political reputation affecting his position in the literary canon. Instead of straightening out this political and canonical maladjustment, the essay argues for Fallada's significance as a bad example for those looking for moral and political lessons in mid-century German letters. "Der Alpdruck", his 1947 novel about a Soviet-installed mayor, depicts his wrong-headedness, first, as the autobiographical protagonist fails to adopt a satisfactory affect toward postwar guilt and innocence, and second, as he eyes two would-be benefactors, fictional counterparts to Gottfried Benn and Johannes R. Becher, with a wily realism that serves as a foil to their cultural or political responsibility.<br>

Abstract: The present paper is an analysis of the functioning of memory, selective memory and oblivion (or to put it differently—the game of remembering, partial remembering and forgetting) in Poland during the period of democratic transformation which, after long years of dictatorship and the hibernation of public discourse, ensures freedom of speech and encourages expression of different beliefs as well as articulation of divergent interests. It defines two distinct layers of memory and oblivion and, consequently, two main types of hidden or repressed elements which may be dubbed "skeletons in the nation's history closet." One is linked with the pre-communist past (before 1945), while the other is connected with the communist past (1945-1989). The latter is linked to political differences—within the same ethnic group—which presently constitute a very hot issue but are less likely to be inherited over more than two generations. The former comprises mostly nationwide skeletons, related mainly to contacts between the Polish and other ethnic groups and involving the sense of collective identity, collective pride, collective guilt, and collectively suffered injustice. On the one hand, these skeletons are currently still more willingly kept in the closet because they can be detrimental to the perception and self-perception of the national group as a whole, but on the other hand the memory of these ethnic and religious conflicts is more likely to be inherited and internalized by future generations for much longer. The question of how to facilitate the process of removing the nationwide skeletons from the national memory closet seems, therefore, all the more important.<br>

Abstract: Será possível colocar a questão da culpa à parte de determinantes morais e históricos? Heidegger parece pensar que sim e, em verdade, empreende esta tarefa com base na reflexão sobre o papel do chamamento, um tema que, como a culpa, também está rodeado por inevitáveis conotações religiosas. O seu propósito inicial, mesmo que não declarado explicitamente, é mostrar a viabilidade de uma análise do chamamento, sem fazer uma apologia de qualquer tradição. Por seu lado, Foucault mostrou-nos os problemas associados com uma separação histórico-social do tema da culpa. Neste artigo pretendo expor estas duas abordagens sobre a questão da culpa. Is it possible to raise the question of guilt apart from those moral and historical determinants? Heidegger seems to think so and actually undertakes this task based on the reflection on the role of the call, a matter that, like guilt, is also surrounded by unavoidable religious cannotations. Its initial purpose, but does not state explicitly, is to show that it is feasible consistent and deep analysis of the call without making at any time through you an apology for any religious tradition. For his part, Foucault has shown us the problems associated with socio-historical untethering of the issue of guilt. In this paper I intend to expose these two lines of approach to the question of guilt.<br>

tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Abstract: Hannah Arendt hat einmal von der perfiden Auffassung der Nationalsozialisten “guilt
by association" gesprochen, womit gemeint war, dass jeder, der mit “Juden" umgehe,
sich “schuldig" mache, vgl. Hannah Arendt, Elemente und Ursprünge totaler Herr-
schaft. Antisemitismus, Imperialismus, totale Herrschaft, München 2000, S. 696. Auf-
fällig ist die bei Fest und anderen zu findende, ständige Hervorhebung “jüdischer
Freundschaften" bis hin “zur selbstlosen Hilfsbereitschaft und Sorge" seiner Familie
auch unter der Gefahr der Verfolgung. In der auffälligen Art und Weise der fortwäh-
renden Betonung steckt ein signifikantes Erzählmuster, das die persönliche Abgrenzung
gegenüber den Nationalsozialisten noch einmal herausstellt. Auf die Problematik einer
trennenden Semantik in “Deutsche" und “Juden", wie sie von Fest vorgenommen wird
(vgl. ebd., z.B. S. 344), kann nicht weiter eingegangen werden.<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: The present research investigates the relationship between anxiety and the religiosity dimensions that Wulff (Psychology of religion: classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1991; Psychology of religion. Classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1997; Psychologia religii. Klasyczna i wspotczesna, Wydawnictwo Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, Warszawa, 1999) described as Exclusion vs. Inclusion of Transcendence and Literal vs. Symbolic. The researchers used the Post-Critical Belief scale (Hutsebaut in J Empir Theol 9(2): 48-66, 1996; J Empir Theol 10(1): 39-54, 1997) to measure Wulff's religiosity dimensions and the IPAT scale (Krug et al. 1967) to measure anxiety. Results from an adult sample (N = 83) suggest that three dimensions show significant relations with anxiety. Orthodoxy correlated negatively with suspiciousness (L) and positively with guilt proneness (O) factor—in the whole sample. Among women, Historical Relativism negatively correlated with suspiciousness (L), lack of integration (Q3), general anxiety and covert anxiety. Among men, Historical Relativism positively correlated with tension (Q4) and emotional instability (C), general anxiety, covert anxiety and overt anxiety. External Critique was correlated with suspiciousness (L) by men.<br>

Abstract: La confrontation théologique à la critique du christianisme contenue dans l'œuvre du Marquis de Sade n'est pas encore habituelle. Ces pages offrent donc une entrée dans la réflexion qui peut naître d'une telle confrontation. L'article se divise en sept paragraphes qui reprennent les grandes lignes de mon travail théologique inspiré par la pensée de Sade. La question du mal semble être au centre de ce dialogue. C'est autour de notions telles que le péché, la responsabilité, la culpabilité ou le mal radical que s'articule l'argumentation. The theological confrontation with the criticism of Christianity contained in the work of Marquis de Sade is not yet common. These pages offer a point of entry into reflection which can originate from such a confrontation. The article is divided into seven paragraphs based on the main lines of my theological work inspired by the thought of Sade. The problem of evil seems to be at the centre of this dialogue. The argument develops around such notions as sin, responsability, guilt and radical evil.<br>

Abstract: Historians are dumb witnesses to a culture wrangling with itself about its criminal past if they only narrate the sequence of historical controversies such as those that have dotted the German public landscape since the Holocaust. They need to be alive to the subterranean biblical themes flowing beneath the surface froth of events, linking past and present through the continuity of German political emotions that are necessarily collective and therefore sensitive to anxieties about accusations of collective, inherited sin. This article argues that the guilt/shame couplet so common both in public German and academic discourses about postwar Germany cannot account for the intergenerational transmission of moral pollution signified by Holocaust memory. In order to understand the dynamics of German political emotions, it is more useful to employ an alternative couplet: stigma and sacrifice.<br>

Abstract: He also envies those people who died in the dark, who did not have to “see the faces of their murderers.” Perhaps the advantage of the dead's not glimpsing the faces of their murderers is that the deceased would never realize the horror of the depravity of their fellow humans. It is this truth of human existence that the speaker, the survivor of the whole horror, has had to live with: “It is a sad story when one survives.” The speaker is perhaps guilty of having survived the horrors that consumed others. One of the ways to assuage that guilt is to defy the silence that surrounds the horror. Through him the poet seems to put the survivors to shame and guilt.<br>

Abstract: Indeed, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reports that individuals with hope deficits experience a range of enervating feelings that include helplessness, guilt, and despair; and in extreme cases, says the institute, the hopeless may succumb to depression and suicide.
         
               Similarly, the American Psychological Association links hopelessness with helplessness, self-blame and, most notably, depression.7
            
               “People who are depressed,” the association observes, “may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide.”8
            
               Clinically speaking, the hopeless are mired in distress, immiserated. They cannot lead fulfilling lives, let alone thrive. In acute circumstances, they may even choose not to live at all. Clearly, when hopelessness metastasizes into depression, it becomes a life-threatening disease. Hence, without the therapeutic restoration of hope, the forlorn remain in grave danger of frantically treading water for a while and then, with no lifeline in sight, eventually drowning from sheer debilitation in a sea of isolation and anguish. Hope, then, is undeniably critical to wellness, and, in my judgment, hope is precisely the quality that best accounts for the buoyancy Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur demonstrated throughout their long and productive lives—lives that included frustration, disappointment, and adversity along with success, satisfaction, and recognition.9<br>
