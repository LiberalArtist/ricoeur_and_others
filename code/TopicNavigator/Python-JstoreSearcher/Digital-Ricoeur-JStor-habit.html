  Discovery and Pedagogy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt8fr">For René Girard</a><br>
  Author(s) Graham Tyler<br>
  Abstract: I still remember the day I began to appreciate the work of René Girard. It was a summer morning in 1979, and I was doing research in the Bizzell Memorial Library at the University of Oklahoma. I was drafting a dissertation on Kenneth Burke and was in the habit of checking any book that came into my hands to see if there were any references to Burke. I chanced across Girard’s latest publication,
                     To Double Business Bound.¹ Flipping through the text, I discovered this passage:<br>

  Abstract: A hard-drinking Irishman who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1783, John M’Kean was a notorious wife beater. He apparently hit his wife daily, sometimes for no reason, sometimes for trifling reasons, sometimes just because he was drunk and was in the habit. One wonders what his neighbors were doing during these constant batterings; nonetheless, when he finally killed his wife and was hanged for it, one observer ventured that “the safety of society requires it.” But it would seem that
                  societywas not threatened, just hiswife—which means that some intervention was needed before, not after, she was beaten to<br>

  Book Title: Veiled Desires: Intimate Portrayals of Nuns in Postwar Anglo-American Film-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SABINE MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: A provocative, interdisciplinary study of nuns on the big screen, from The Bells of St. Mary's (1945) to Doubt (2008), that shines fresh light on the cinematic nun as a woman and a religious in the twentieth century. Ingrid Bergman's engaging screen performance as Sister Mary Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's made the film nun a star and her character a shining standard of comparison. She represented the religious life as the happy and rewarding choice of a modern woman who had a "complete understanding" of both erotic and spiritual desire. How did this vibrant and mature nun figure come to be viewed as girlish and naive? Why have she and her cinematic sisters in postwar popular film so often been stereotyped or selectively analyzed, so seldom been seen as women and religious? In Veiled Desires--a unique full-length, in-depth study of nuns in film--Maureen Sabine explores these questions in a groundbreaking interdisciplinary study covering more than sixty years of cinema. She looks at an impressive breadth of films in which the nun features as an ardent lead character, including The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), Black Narcissus (1947), Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), Sea Wife (1957), The Nun's Story (1959), The Sound of Music (1965), Change of Habit (1969), In This House of Brede (1975), Agnes of God (1985), Dead Man Walking (1995), and Doubt (2008). Veiled Desires considers how the beautiful and charismatic stars who play chaste nuns, from Ingrid Bergman and Audrey Hepburn to Susan Sarandon and Meryl Streep, call attention to desires that the veil concealed and the habit was thought to stifle. In a theologically and psychoanalytically informed argument, Sabine responds to the critics who have pigeonholed the film nun as the obedient daughter and religious handmaiden of a patriarchal church, and the respectful audience who revered her as an icon of spiritual perfection. She provides a framework for a more complex and holistic picture of nuns on screen by showing h~<br>

  Abstract: When Audrey Hepburn appeared on-screen in 1959, looking immaculate in a black-and-white habit, the nun was still a figure veiled in mystique. This mystique derived its power from the traditional religious view that she “binds herself to
                  a state of perfection, which requires a striving toward holiness that is … life-long” (Donovan and Wusinich 2008: 39). InThe Nun’s Story, film director Fred Zinnemann showed his respect for the heroic entrants, endurance runners, and dropouts in the arduous spiritual marathon to become perfect as “your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). He appreciated the ancient beauty of this ideal and<br>

  Abstract: Hermeneutics is the form in which epistemology lives on. In one sense epistemology is dead. As the attempt to provide human knowledge with solid foundations, to prove that it can transcend the limitations of its perspectives and be adequate to the reality it intends, it is widely perceived to have failed.

It was,” Gordon insists, “the peculiar habit of her genius.” Several of Gordon’s own critics have used similar terminology to describe the role of “looking” in her art as well. Some have made their references to highlight strengths in Gordon’s prose. Kathryn Hughes, for example, praises Gordon for her “minute observation.”¹ Anita Gandolfo values Gordon’s art for its “prophetic vision” and its ability to bring Catholic issues into “sharper focus.”² Others have been<br>

  Abstract: In 1913, Walter Benjamin was a central figure alongside his teacher, Gustav Wyneken, in the ‘German Youth Movement’, agitating for substantial reforms in the German educational system and, beyond that, in German society. He placed one of his first serious publications, an essay entitled ‘Experience’, in

  Abstract: What is cultural studies for, and what is it against? There can be, of course, no single answer to this question. There is a habit amongst commentators, especially those who, being located outside the UK, are understandably removed from the political contexts which produced British cultural studies, of deploying the term ‘cultural studies’ as an adjective, using it to describe certain determinate political positions as well as certain specifiable methodologies. Such references to ‘cultural studies’ positions or approaches effectively conflate cultural studies – an interdisciplinary field of enquiry – with the political tradition which has informed its dominant strand in<br>

  Author(s) Walters Lori<br>
  Abstract: Ekphrasis no longer enjoys the name recognition it once did. In the terminology of classical rhetoric, ekphrasis “was the elaborate ‘delineation’ (έκΦρασις,
                  descriptio, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Abstract: Magda Trocmé’s independent spirit and her habit of practical response to human needs came straight out of her Siberian heritage. Her ancestors on both the Italian and the Russian side were aristocratic people born to wealth and privilege, but the Russians in her family tree were notable for not allowing privilege to blind them to the human misery at the bottom of society, a misery endured by the moujiks (slaves) to serve the interests of the rich. Not so her Italian ancestors. They were much more inclined to assume that privilege was their birthright and poverty was other people’s fate.<br>

  Abstract: Despite their pronounced differences, dickinson and Whitman are looking-glass reflections of each other and of America; although, as in facing mirrors, each one’s work is also the inverse of the other. One crux of this mutual reflection is their shared figural traditions of American culture. These originate in the biblical typologies that promised to align not only spiritual and mundane worlds, but the extensions of these into self, community, history, and God. Each practices and also tests this habit of figural alignment. The poetry of each is figurally complex, in ways often overlooked in Whitman (who can seem like the<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Donald<br>
  Abstract: The burden of the argument to this point has been that philosophy, in response to needs generated within its “own” history, has come to be at necessary odds with its self, its history, and the proprietary self-presence implicit in such notions of self and history. In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature. Literary criticism and theory thus find themselves in an odd position: a discipline that has a long-established habit of looking elsewhere—primarily to science or philosophy—for models of its<br>

Abstract: This form of sympathy that manifests itself in the body is called “natural” (
      naturale) and relates to two other kinds of sympathetic connections: “imaginary” (fantastica) and “rational” (razionale). In this three‐part concept of sympathy, Tesauro summarizes a rhetorical process in which “human discourse” (human discorso) holds the primary position. According to Tesauro, “rational sympathy causes the imaginary [sympathy], and because of its influence on blood the imaginary brings about the natural.”76Conversely, a natural sympathy produces internal images, which lead to discourse, “so that a natural love eventually becomes a virtuous habit.”77<br>

Abstract: If human beings are autonomous in designing their own life projects—an autonomy they cannot be deprived of, since that is what makes them human and constitutes their human dignity—then the same applies to their religious life: that, too, may be seen as a project that they design autonomously. The person’s own identity, values, rituals, and practices form the very core of this project. Any contempt of whatever religious conviction or habit—be it fundamentalist Christian, liberal‐Christian, Islamic, Hindu, or indigenous—is harmful. Nor is shame about one’s own rituals and convictions compatible with such a project.
            26The reason is that both contempt and shame undermine the person’s self‐esteem and self‐regard, thus violating human dignity.<br>

Abstract: By the time of Thomas’s
         Summa Theologica, the distinction of poetics from ethics is fully taken for granted. In the brief sections he devotes to it, Thomas directly and explicitly follows Aristotle to argue that “art is the ‘right reason of things to be made’; whereas prudence [that is, phronesis] is the ‘right reason of things to be done.’ … Now ‘making’ and ‘doing’ differ … in that ‘making’ is an action passing into outward matter, e.g. ‘to build,’ ‘to saw,’ and so forth; whereas ‘doing’ is an action abiding in the agent, e.g. ‘to see,’ ‘to will,’ and the like.”9Again, since moral virtue is judged according to its internal habit or end, it is of an entirely different nature than art or creativity, whose goodness or worth is defined principally by the external form of its product.<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: What follows marks out one experimental path, albeit a deviant and wildly hypothetical one, toward an analytic habit I have come to call
         narratography.It is concerned less with the ontology or essence of narrative form across media, its invariant rudiments, than are the usual deliberations of narratology.1Where narratology aspires to a science of transmedial procedures, narratography settles upon the immanent workings of a given medium and, in probing the conditioning operations of graphophonemic or photomechanical inscription, for instance, sets its sights in turn on formative constraints and discrepancies. Narratology abstracts from a given plot, in verbal or cinematic print, to its generalizable modalities. Honing in on the transacted space between genre and its specific phrasal or optical materialization, narratography focuses its attention on the mediate—which is to say, in narrative literature, on those linguistic effects that stand for represented action, of course, but that at the same time standbetweenit and any readerly comprehension.<br>

Author(s): Kitts Margo<br>
Abstract: At a more intricate level, the metaphorical switch of the ritual actor might be deemed textural, not just structural. Structural metaphorical switches tend to translate between contemporary and ancient models based on some isomorphism of structure or similarity of relationship of parts (structural similarities), whereas textural transformations, according to Fernandez, tend to assimilate ritual actors to new personas based on similarity in feeling tone, contiguities in previous experience, or syntagmatic habit.
         86In this case a simulation of heroic mentality may have been produced by ritual acts such as reciting, praying, blowing Quranic verses into one’s possessions, purifying the body, and so on, which together induced a transformation irreducible to the sum of its parts. As Ricouer might see it, the metaphor was thickened and enriched by a spectrum of images, practices, and stories that attached themselves to the imaginative process when the ritual actor encountered the enacted metaphor, thus enhancing the paradoxical figuration of the 9/11 ritual actor as a seventh‐century holy warrior.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But even if Faustus performs the affects of repentance, he cannot repent and be saved in the strict theological sense because until the very end he exhibits the inward disposition of the faithless magician who must choose to be duped by Satan. But why does he have such an inward disposition in the first place? Is it indeed that God has predestined Faustus to hell, subjected him to the most miserable necessity? For Paul Ricoeur, the question of “the scandalous theology of predestination to evil” is the tragic question par excellence, which is why the tragic is always, in Ricoeur's formulation, “a temptation to despair” in its display of the “hostile transcendence to which the hero is prey.”
      36But Marlowe's play, as much as it also invites the audience to despair, stages something more subtle and finally more wrenching than blank divine vengeance, for in fact it employs the more charitable theology represented by Holland rather than that of Perkins: Faustus may indeed repent, and God may indeed change his mind. The possibility of repentance provides the suspense that makes the play dramatic rather than merely iconographical, and that gives force and fear to those apparently trivial spectacles that repeatedly persuade Faustus not to perform his inward penance. Yet at the same time, there does seem to be something fated in the way that Faustus is introduced to the audience with a habit of mind that makes it impossible for him to take his given opportunities to repent.Doctor Faustusthus brings the audience right up against the nondialectical, and therefore tragic, contradiction of the theology of grace: the fact an omnipotent and supposedly loving God permits creaturely suffering, or, in terms more specific to the play, that God rejects a man who cries out to him simply because that man thinks like a dramatist rather than an allegorist.37Milton, on his part, tries to solve this problem at the heart of Christianity with a theodicy of human insufficiency—the archange~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: In books 5 and 6 we hear the archfiend seducing, debating, encouraging, and vaunting. Just as we are in the habit of referring to “Milton’s Satan” we should perhaps here speak of “Raphael’s Satan.” The reason we do not is that Raphael’s Satan is acoustically so similar to the Satan of books 1–4 that we simply forget he is not literally here in propria persona, speaking these exact words. It is of course possible that Raphael heard some of these words. But as Elizabeth Sauer rightly points out, “Raphael’s narrative supplies information to which the angel could not possibly have access, including knowledge of Satan’s speeches to his cohorts and of the invention of the ‘devilish Enginry.’”
         
               Given the uncertain extent of Raphael’s accommodation, we cannot even be sure that what transpired in heaven was in any sense verbal. Can angels rebel with inarticulate groans? Does sedition permeate heaven as an odor or a flash of colored light? Such things, as Sir Thomas Browne would say, are not beyond all conjecture.33
            
               Whatever the case, Milton urges us at various points in these books to see Raphael as deeply invested in an act of imaginative making whose extent we can never fully gauge. His prefatory remarks seem to represent a real anxiety on Raphael’s part about what it is he chooses to do. To his list of authorial risks—the epistemological, the affective, and the legal—we might add a fourth, ethical risk. “Is it permissible,” he might have asked, “for me to manufacture satanic speech and communicate it to these yet sinless creatures?”34<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: That should remind us of the two religious dimensions that Bonhoeffer aimed to overcome for the sake of a worldly faith, namely other-worldliness (metaphysics) and inwardness (individualism). By making us servants of the “heavenly God,” who does not have the human face of Jesus, religion almost automatically establishes the sphere of the sacred and that of the profane, and in so doing makes us see ourselves as privileged or pure. In such a divided reality, those who do not confess our God sooner or later become our enemies. While narrowly comprehended, religious affiliation generates the distinctions that divide us into hostile camps, the Christ of the nonreligious faith “wants us to be in the midst of our enemies, just as she was.”
         
               The religion that Bonhoeffer seeks to deconstruct is the “habit of heart that allows us to approach the world without love, even while declaring that we are doing just the opposite.”160
            
               In this sense, Bonhoeffer’s holistic approach to life and his Christological radicalism can preclude the church from falling into totalitarianism, on the one hand, and becoming sectarian and xenophobic, on the other. Individualism also constitutes a constant threat to faith, yet in a different way: striving for my own salvation simply goes against the Christian ideal of participation in Jesus’s being for others and consequent solidarity with the world’s sufferings. Besides, the egocentric focus on one’s own salvation that compromises the common good can be easily manipulated into serving diverse political agendas. Indeed, when one’s salvation becomes a matter of saving one’s own culture, society, country or community, it shows that religion degenerates into what Bonhoeffer calls “pagan wisdom.”161

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: The Greek term 'ethos' originally had the twofold sense of 'habitation' and 'habit'.
Etymologically those two English terms are affinitive, as too are the German equivalents
Wohnung and Gewohnheit and, for instance, also the German terms Sitz (seat) and Sitte
(custom, morals). Thus habits seek a habitation.<br>

Abstract: What is meant by tradition? What gives tradition its continuity? This article begins with an exploration of Michael Oakeshott's defense of both tradition's continuity and the rich texture of human life, but finds that it does not account adequately for a tradition's continuity. The work of Hans-Georg Gadamer offers a refinement of Oakeshott's view of tradition, but where Oakeshott emphasizes habit, Gadamer emphasizes reflectivity. The author concludes by suggesting an alternative perspective, one that understands tradition as the transmission of meaning.<br>

Author(s): Denoyel Noël<br>
Abstract: L'alternance entre les trois pôles de la formation (auto-hétéro-oïko) présente dans les pratiques de formation alternée (variété des situations d'apprentissage et des acteurs) renvoie à la différenciation des trois personnes pronominales (je-tu-il) du langage courant et s'inscrit dans l'épistémologie ternaire de la sémiotique initiée par Peirce. L'intelligence pratique et rusée (la métis des Grecs), repérée chez des artisans grâce à l'expression régionale « le biais du gars », met en scène une logique ouverte où transduction et abduction s'articulent à déduction et induction. Une « raison expérientielle » , dialogique, écologique, à visée éthique, est ainsi forgée. C'est une rationalité pratique cherchant à actualiser le potentiel de la situation. Elle est empreinte de sagesse et de « prudence » en action, au sens d'Aristote (phronésis). L'éc(h)oformation qui émerge de cette raison expérientielle, de ce regard interactionnel, est indissociable de la boucle étrange entre deux autres raisons : la raison sensible et la raison formelle, entre spontanéité et habitude. The tripolar concept of training (auto-hetero-oïko), foundation of alternating courses practice (with multiple learning situations and actors), draws us back to the differenciation between the three main persons singular (I, You, He) expressed in common language as the compound epistemology of semiotics put forward by Peirce... Practical intelligence (close to the "metis" of the Greeks) can be noticed among craftsmen when they refer to the "biais du gars" bespeaking an open logic where transduction and abduction are linked to deduction and induction. A constructive reasoning, interactive ans ecological, with ethical objectives, is created. It's a practical rationality aiming at actualizing the potentiality of the situation and marked by sagaciy and prudence in action in the Aristotelian sense (phronesis). The "ec(h)otraining" emerging from the wisdom of experience, this interactive vision of things is neces~<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: The radical Chinese intellectual Li Zhi (1527-1602) is known for his habit of opposing traditional interpretations of canonical texts. Juxtaposing Li Zhi's irreverent strategies of reading and writing with those of his French contemporary, the essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592), this paper casts both writers as responding to analogous social and economic pressures characteristic of the developing early modern world. Unlike earlier generations, who sought to recapture authorial intentions, readers in this era increasingly took upon themselves the authority to impose meaning subjectively upon texts. And the books they composed, in turn, provoked impassioned debate among readers.<br>

Abstract: L'article étudie les modifications successives et conjointes des arguments de convenance et des structures du traité de l'Incarnation au long de l'itinéraire de S. Thomas. Il se propose de contester l'habitude de réduire la place du Christ dans la Somme Théologique à la simple causalité rédemptrice. Une lecture attentive de la première question de la Tertia pars de la Somme Théologique établit que l'opposition habituelle entre Incarnation et Rédemption se trouve dépassée dans la découverte du mystère pascal de Jésus comme la manifestation et la réalité de Dieu toujours plus grand. La Christologie est alors tout autre chose qu'un appendice : la consummatio totius theologici negotii, clef de voûte et principe de toute la théologie. The article studies the successive and conjunct modifications of the arguments of convenance and the structures the treatise on the Incarnation throughout St. Thomas' itinerary. It is proposed to contest the habit of reducing the place of Christ in the Summa Theologica to a simple redemptive causality. An attentive reading of the first question of the Tertia Pars of the Summa Theologica establishes that the habitual opposition between Incarnation and Redemption is found to be surpassed in the discovery of the Pascal Mystery of Jesus as the manifestation and reality of the always greater God. The Christology is then quite other than a mere appendix: the consummatio totius theologici negotii, keystone and principle of all theology.<br>

Abstract: Of course, by the time SPEP was founded, the more blockheaded features of the logical empiricists' program were already losing their appeal. Rational reconstruction, the stress on theory verification but never theory discovery, the anachronistic habit of modeling all thinking on nineteenth-century physics, emotivism in ethics and politics—all the famous earmarks of twentieth-century positivism were being challenged. Yet we could see that these specific challenges were no great cause for optimism and certainly no occasion for celebrating anything like the rise of a real revolution in the philosophical mainstream.
      
            For one thing, much of the early opposition to logical empiricism involved criticizing its overt features by means of a silent acceptance of its underlying conception of philosophy itself, and it was this underlying ontological and epistemological sense of what is really real and how to think about it against which we were trying to access a lot of neglected things themselves.7<br>

Abstract: Such a transfer is a matter of habit for Derrida. Thus, he writes, “Language has started without us, in us and before us. This is what theology calls God.”
            
                  Or again, Derrida speaks of “the absolute singularity of the other, whose name here is God” (GD 66).21
               
                  Or once again, “God is the name of the possibility I have of keeping a secret that is visible from the interior but not from the exterior” (GD 108). When such human characteristics or capacities as language, singularity, and interiority are given as the meaning of “God,” we have, once again, Feuerbachian atheism.22<br>

Abstract: This example, albeit brief, already provides an important clue about the locus of the connection between Deleuze and phenomenology. For the above contrast could equally be characterized in terms of the difference between a static and a genetic phenomenology. Deleuze's transcendental empiricism, in other words, bears some resemblance to Husserl's description of the passive syntheses (temporality, habit, etc.) that precede and condition the active syntheses performed by intentional acts of consciousness. From this perspective, we can see both thinkers as inquiring into what precedes and gives rise to the meaning-formations established within a static analysis of intentional consciousness. By all accounts, Deleuze was unaware of Husserl's genetic phenomenology. But if he were, one could easily imagine that he would have been more receptive to phenomenology. And likewise, when Husserlians become aware of the new directions developed in Janicaud's minimal phenomenology, my sense is that they too will come to embrace Deleuzian insights as possible extensions of genetic phenomenology.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: Meanwhile another word underpins and undermines the

               The promise of phonic redemption proves false and even risible, not only125

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Another way to clarify what Utopia might be for architecture is to begin with Saint (Sir) Thomas More's (1478–1535) originary coinage of the term in 1516 and the definition that extends from it. First, it is worth considering that
         Utopiais a much older word thandystopia. Nevertheless, because More's Utopia depicts an imaginary island enjoying a putatively perfect social, legal, and political system,Utopiahas primarily come to be associated with all such representations of the same, literary, architectural, and political alike.Utopia, though, contains within itself two senses that when taken together establish something of a paradox: referring to the Greekou(no) andeu(good) plustopos(place),Utopiaconnotes both “a good place” and a “no place.” By beinga good no place, Utopia seems to inscribe within itself the most common criticism of it: impossibility (as a placeless place). Worse still, because no (actual) place can be (or even approximate) an ideal state, the value of Utopia seems dubious at best. Even more troubling, because the ideal state depicted in Utopia requires a degree of coercion, as all social organizations do, Utopia has come to be associated with tyranny and is rejected, which deprives the imagination of a concept for possibilities. In the absence of a crucial habit for thinking about how to achieve the possible-impossible, the culturally dominant conviction that “there is no alternative” has taken on the character of a natural law, leading Fredric Jameson to observe: “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world.”
