  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt9dq">Executing Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: I argued in chapter 2 that post-Revolutionary America experienced a backlash against too-damned-much-democracy: revolutionary impulses needed to be curtailed, so elites thought, to prevent the young nation from succumbing to what founding father Benjamin Rush diagnosed as the disease of “anarchia” and from sliding into what the Connecticut Wits portrayed in
                  The Anarchiadas a coming age of democracy run wild. Part of this backlash against those who took the words of the Declaration of Independence too literally—for of course all men were not created equal and happiness was not a natural right—entailed the use of state-sanctioned violence,<br>

  Abstract: A recurring preoccupation of Arthur Schopenhauer was the impossibility of finding happiness in the company of others. Insisting that “no man can be in
                  perfect accordwith any one but himself”¹ and extolling the virtues of self-sufficiency, Schopenhauer nevertheless acknowledges that, for many people, the inner life is so empty and unsatisfying that they are driven “to the company of others which consists of men like themselves, forsimilis simili gaudet” (Birds of a feather flock together).² Elsewhere, he makes this point with a parable.

                  Berliner Tageblattwith the composer’s notes in the margin. “I am rising higher and higher,” Willette was reported to have said on his deathbed with an expression of profound happiness. “Now I am ascending straight up, always up, continuously without stopping, quick as an arrow—straight to Paradise.”¹ Willette had a peaceful exit from the world, strikingly dissimilar from the violent departure of Richard Gerstl, whose death remained an open wound for Schoenberg, his one-time friend and disciple.² Willette’s death, in contrast,<br>

  Abstract: At the turn of the twenty-first century, Richard Rorty put forward his vision for a new form of social hope, “the hope that life will eventually be freer, less cruel, more leisured, richer in goods and experiences, not just for our descendants but for everybody’s descendants.”¹ The first step toward this neopragmatic future requires a change in priorities in which “everybody thinks that it is human solidarity, rather than knowledge of something not merely human, that really matters.”² This utopian task of “replacing certainty with hope” requires establishing a different kind of solidarity based on increasing individual happiness rather than<br>

  Abstract: In comfortable Western societies, we are able to run from suffering and after success, happiness, health, and eternal youth. Though we do not say it out loud, we long for immortality, and our faith in ever-evolving progress has led us to believe in a future without suffering. Yet, until recently, the monotheistic

  Author(s) Holbrook Peter<br>
  Abstract: The emotions are not simply a matter for literature: critics have them too. Or, more interestingly, perhaps, they play an important role in the critical process which goes far beyond any naively expressive response to the emotional content of literary works. The reading of
                  Hamletpresented here raises this as a problem in the theory and history of emotions, in that it foregrounds the questions of what happiness and unhappiness are, and of how they might best be deployed in acts of criticism. Happiness, one might think, must be scarce enough in this play, and indeed it is, at least<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Abstract: It is usual nowadays when a philosophic defense of human rights or natural rights is undertaken to attempt to treat the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or the right to property, privacy, safety, education and the like as prima facie rights, or at least as rights that are in some way indefeasible.<br>

  Author(s) WERPEHOWSKI WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Near the beginning of the
                  prima secundae, secunda parsof theSumma theologiae, Aquinas says that every rational agent necessarily desires and seeks his or her own happiness (STI-II 5.4ad2, 5.8). This was a commonplace for Aquinas and his interlocutors, and it might seem that he only affirms it out of deference to a long-established tradition.¹ But Aquinas is very well able to distance himself from traditional claims when his overall position requires him to do so, and that is not what we see him doing here. On the contrary, he takes this claim as the starting<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Abstract: Becoming a child again: the first reaction may be a feeling that this would be wonderful—no responsibility, no battling with expectations, no long memories of failure and ambiguity. But when Jesus of Nazareth tells us to become like children, and when spiritual masters urge us to connect with the “child mind,” they are not being nostalgic or sentimental. They are drawing our attention to something we all instinctively recognise. There is something that our habitual adult consciousness has lost or buried, and it must be found, not as a comforting reinstatement of half-forgotten happiness but as a breakthrough to<br>

  Abstract: We saw in the Introduction that conservatism seeks to defend a particular vision of human life that George Santayana defined as Christian Platonic in nature. In chapter 1, I considered one aspect of that vision: how it envisions human happiness in comparison with typical modern accounts of it. It now seems appropriate to ask a more foundational question. If conservatism seeks to conserve the western tradition, then what are that tradition’s constitutive principles?<br>

The Professor asserts that art and religion are compatible, that they are—or at least have the potential to be—equal and complementary forces for finding meaning in life. Many readers and critics believe this linking of religion and art expresses not only Godfrey St. Peter’s thinking but also that of Willa Cather, who said almost the<br>

  Abstract: “Surely my memory is where you dwell,” Augustine famously writes in his

Augustine argues that one way that we can be sure that werememberGod is that we all seek the happiness God brings, even though we have not yet found it in this life: How else could we know about it?¹ It must be that we<br>

One of the first things that happens through mimesis is that we enjoy a pleasure not associated with or caused by the ordinary animal appetites: the pleasure of mimesis. And being naturally mimetic, we enjoy this often. Out of this process the arts first grew, but this natural process is<br>

  Abstract: I trust that the title I have chosen is not too melancholy. The topic is a large one, but it is certainly familiar to all of us, and it is difficult to see how anything could be of greater concern to thoughtful human beings. The question before us is whether the life of reason is happy or sad. Those who dislike large topics might be inclined to reply, “Sometimes sad, sometimes happy,” and I suppose they would mean by this that happiness depends upon something other than our degree of rationality. In one sense, I agree with this sober reply.<br>

These we realize throughout our lives as we participate in practices, which are but the expression of our goods.

  Abstract: FOR ANYONE, ARTIST OR NOT, the experience of exile is bound to be upsetting to their happiness and well-being (if such things really exist). It matters little whether such an uprooting is the result of voluntary emigration in search of a better world or forcible banishment from one’s homeland. The loss of points of reference, of the feeling of belonging, combined with an abrupt break in the continuity and evolution of a person’s life, are overwhelming and can lead to an acute sense of disorientation and chaos, especially if the person is a writer.<br>

This neuroturn within the field of ethics promises to enhance understanding of ourselves and of our fellow human beings. It has been argued that this knowledge will be a route to foster happiness in individual lives and the foundation of brain-based ethical norms and behaviors that will lead to greater social well-being (Changeux 1996, 1981).

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Abstract: Having described the infection of eighteenth-century discourses by the trial paradigm and the transformation of the concept of happiness wrought by it, I am also arguing implicitly that these transformations are still with us. Most obviously, we have inherited a constitution from the period that still attests to the suspension of the political hermeneutic of happiness. Moreover, our understanding of happiness is indubitably in large part the one produced by the eighteenth century. But if these effects continue today, the reader may well wonder where the trial narrative itself is to be found. We can still detect vestigial forms of<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and~<br>

Abstract: The chapter “Nobody's Weakness” closes with Arthur ruminating gloomily (and rather opaquely) about how “it might be better to flow away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain” (
            LD,p. 200). Though “flow away” seems at first only a metaphor, so abstract and disembodied is the reverie that there is a kind of phantasmal grammatical alternative trickling into the melancholic drift of the prose. In this way that second infinitive of compensation or complementation may also faintly evoke a sense that Arthur indeed wishes to mix materially with the lethal waters, literally (and more idiomatically) to “compound … with” them.<br>

Abstract: One such case of self‐betrayal occurs in the often‐cited episode of the trees of Hudimesnil. Riding on the carriage of Mme de Villeparisis, Marcel feels an unexplainable happiness at the sight of three trees; yet, try hard as he may, he cannot find a reason to his happiness. These trees, so strangely familiar, are perhaps a memory from childhood or from a dream, or a cryptic epiphany, or just an optical impression owing to eye fatigue. They seem to be asking of Marcel that he “return them to life”; he recognizes in their “naïve and passionate gesticulations the impotent regret of a dear person who, having lost the usage of words, feels he cannot tell us what we are unable to guess.” Having failed repeatedly to identify the source of his emotion, Marcel gives up puzzling over it, and at that precise moment he feels “as if he had just lost a friend,
            died to himself, denied a dead person, or misidentified a god.” Proust,À l’ombre des jeunes filles en fleursII, 568–69; my emphasis.<br>

Abstract: We may begin with querying what we should desire in our prayers. One answer comes in the fragment “On St Paul’s Definition of Faith,” where Coleridge carefully defines the object of faith as something other than mere happiness: “We erroneously imagine the blessedness of Heaven to consist in
         Happiness, i.e. in pleasuresoutof ourselves: whereas it consists inHoliness, not in what we shallhavebut in what we shallbe. … This is the great delusion of the fleshly Fancy, that we make Heaven a Having instead of a Being.”19This is a fundamental insight: what we should pray for is a state of being, which the same text defines precisely as a being‐for‐God: “As Iamin my Father, even so yearein me, that God maybeall in all.”20Being‐for‐God is our most authentic, constitutive identity, and that is what we should yearn for: “We affirm the Idea of therealself which is one with the Absolute Being, without reference to theapparentSelf, by which we are divided from the absolute” (N5581, fol. 181v). As Coleridge writes in a note of 1827, “Man is by his constitution areligiouscreature,” and “the cultivation of the Religious Sense” is the “propereffect” of prayer (N5554, fol. 13v).<br>

Abstract: The intensification of divine transcendence, however, did not necessarily establish the conditions for human autonomy. As I suggested above, mystic theologians such as Fénelon formulated a different response to the dilemmas posed by a deity whose motives had become virtually unknowable. In so doing, he departed from the post-Tridentine doctrine that reaffirmed the soul's intrinsic interest in salvation as a function of the natural desire for happiness. Drawing the opposite conclusion, he maintained that the soul was obliged to love God even if it were damned, thus severing the logical and moral connections between human action and the spiritual recompense offered by a hidden deity. On this view, the soul should surrender its possessive attachment to all things, even to itself, so as to make the divine present once more. As he wrote in an undated letter of spiritual direction to Louis XIV's morganatic wife, Madame de Maintenon, “one does not find God purely alone except in this loss of all his gifts, and in this real sacrifice of all of himself, after having lost all interior resources.” Yet radical dispossession returns all that it strips away, insofar as the soul now finds within itself God alone. This presence, Fénelon was careful to note, cannot be regarded as a “gift” but, rather, as “God himself, immediately alone, … who, without being possessed by the soul, possesses it for his own sake.”
         44In its purest form, then, the love of God detaches the human person from any independent claim of autonomous action and takes the place, as an immanent force, of the self's particular existence. As Fénelon made clear in hisTraité de l'existence et des attributs de Dieu(1712, 1718), God's transcendence could give way to a proximity that blurred the boundaries of creator and created. Divine light, he claimed, is “infinitely beyond us,” yet “so familiar and so intimate to us, that we always find it as near to us as we are to ourselves.”45<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: But why, then, does Faustus have this relation in his mind to the devil? As the reformers argued about the magician, Faustus inclines to the devil because he rejects faith, which is to say that he refuses to believe that God promises him immortal happiness. Indeed, critics have long since noticed that Faustus has complete aphasia on the subject of mercy—in his first soliloquy, of course, he omits the lines of 1 John that promise forgiveness to those who repent, rather perversely proclaiming instead that the Bible insists “we must sin, / And so consequently die…an everlasting death” (1.1.46–48).
      25But Faustus erases the promise of God's mercy because he disdains the dualistic Christian metaphysics that underlie that very promise. Christian dualism is taken for granted in the play even by Mephistopheles, who makes a clear distinction between body and soul, radically subordinating the value of the former to the latter. When Faustus orders him to attack the old man, the devil replies: “his faith is great / I cannot touch his soul. / But what I may afflict his body with / I will attempt, which is but little worth” (5.1.79–82). In contrast to his conjured companion, Faustus values the body more than the soul, as if for him the truly sacred communion were found not in the valence of symbolic bread but in the juicy and perfumed grapes he gives to the hugely pregnant duchess, who has been longing for fruit through the dearth of winter.<br>

Abstract: If you want to study happiness, then start with misery. Similarly, the entry points for a study of morality are its negative aspects, of which the most salient is evil. Csordas’s scholarly and thought-provoking article builds significantly on this claim. He precludes the essentialization of morality as a cultural system by embedding it in those human actions that are seen locally to violate moral expectations. So morality does not exist as a cultural system but, in adjectival mode, qualifies and pervades all human social activity.<br>

Abstract: Finke, p. 41: "Mystics took disciplines designed to regulate and subject the body and turned
them into what Michael [sic] Foucault has called 'technologies of the self,' methods of
consolidating spiritual power and authority, perhaps the only ones avalaible to women. Foucault
argues that individuals often effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their
bodies, souls, thoughts, and conduct-all to transform themselves and to attain a certain state of
perfection, happiness, purity, and supernatural power. Although he is describing the medieval
Catholic discipline of confession, he might just as well be describing the lives of many medieval
mystics. Michel de Certeau takes Foucault's argument about technologies of the self even further,
and argues that these mechanisms, which he calls "poaching," enable those subjected to
disciplinary technologies to manipulate and evade them, or even shape them to their own ends, by
seeming to conform to them. To understand how self-torture could become a technology of the
self, a means of empowerment we must understand the place of torture in medieval society."<br>

Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Levinas himself raises the question: "why would I feel responsible in the presence of the Face" since "we are separate ontological beings?" This questions the character of our response to the other--both in terms of agency and motivation. While the general reception of Levinas's thought has focused on his description of us as "hostage"--that is, on the moment of assignation (or assignment) by the other--I suggest that Levinas himself also, though not as directly, addresses (as he needs to) the correlative moment, the moment of response. My essay reconstructs Levinas's implicit understanding of the character of our initiative in the light of his concept of Desire. I explore the different dimensions of Desire as appetite and generosity, and I argue that the "transition to moral consciousness" that Levinas wants to "justify" is one from complacent happiness to "non-complacent happiness" and can be illuminated by the notion of "passion seeking its downfall."<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man.

Abstract: S'appuyant sur un corpus de textes adolescents adressés au site Internet www.filsantejeunes.com, notre analyse tente de cerner le problème de l'indicibilité du sensible, puisque la plupart de ces textes se limitent à élaborer un discours sur le corps, ses difficultés à être la source de bien-être, à se conformer aux normes de beauté, et n'abordent pas le phénomène, l'expérience de perception du monde. La théorie des instances proposée par Jean-Claude Coquet permet de rendre compte de cette impossibilité de dire le sensible, laquelle serait due à une mise en tension conflictuelle des deux instances du non-sujet et du sujet. Ce conflit sans issue peut aboutir à des comportements de boulimie et/ou d'anorexie, aux conséquences graves pour la santé, voire la vie du sujet. La psychothérapie, dans ces cas-là, devrait viser une réconciliation des instances. Ces textes adolescents constituant des exemples d'écriture autobiographique, genre discursif très prisé à l'adolescence, permettent aussi de contribuer à l'analyse de la genèse de ce genre littéraire, où s'impose la reprise différée, par le sujet adulte voire vieillissant, d'expériences anciennes de l'instance non-sujet, expériences corporelles de prise directe avec le monde. This analysis, based on a corpus of texts by teenagers posted on www.filsantejeunes. com, tries to take the measure of the issue of the impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world -since most of these texts are content to limit themselves to elaborating discourses about the body, its difficulties at being a source of happiness, at conforming to norms of beauty, and do not deal with the phenomenon, namely the experience of perceiving the world. The theory of instances, or of the grounding of utterance, elaborated by Jean-Claude Coquet, can explain this impossibility of expressing in language the experience of sensing the world: it is due to a conflict between the two instances, the grounding in the subject or in the no~<br>

Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Abstract: Neste ensaio, entrelaço fios de vidas das mulheres negras que estáo atadas óï fio da minha vida. Com os fios soltos das canções de Zezé Motta e dos escritos da filósofa Hannah Arendt, teço este texto-existência. Na leitura dos ensaios e poemas de Marlene Nourbese Philip, escritora afro-caribenha, me inspiro não só para resistir às amarras culturais hegemônicas, mas também para transcendê-las, criando possibilidades de escrita que vincule a dinâmica da fala com a dinámica da ocóo, compondo um texto que se movimenta ora como dança, através do espaço, ora como urna canção, ritmada pelo tempo, pois criar e dançar uma coreografia é uma forma de fazer historia. Como investiga Selma Treviños, trata-se de urna ferramenta para animar o passado ou uma "escrita" acerca de algo que já foi feito, se concordamos que cada corpo carrega sua pròpria história e individualidade, memòria, sentimentos e emoções. Na busca do entendimento desta minha breve existência, danço, escrevo, teço palavras com fios desfiados da flor do útero das minhas ancestrais. Vasculho minhas lembranças e, na memória corporal, decifro a dor, encontró a raiz da violência, observo o medo, destilo a alegría, enfeito a doçura, mergulho na paz e conheço a liberdade. In that essay I interweave threads of the black women's lives that are tied to the thread of my life. With the free threads of Zezé Motta's songs and of philosopher Hannah Arendfs writings, I weave this text-existence. In the reading of the essay and poems of Marlene NourbeSe Philip, writer Afro-Caribbean, I am inspired not only to resist the hegemonic cultural ties, but also transcend them, creating possibilities of writing that links the dynamics of the speech with the dynamics of the action, to compose a text that is moved some times as a dance through the space, other times as a song, with its rhythm determinedby time, because creating and dancing a choreography is a form of making history. As investigates Selma Treviños it is a tool to encourage th~<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Author(s): Eze Chielozona<br>
Abstract: In the same line of argument as House's, Stephen Halliwell states in
         Aristotle's Poeticsthat pity and fear refer specifically to the “capacity to sympathize with the sufferer.” He emphasizes that “Aristotle does not derive this sympathy from an undifferentiated sense of humanity: instead, he takes it to be rooted in a felt or perceived affinity between the subject and the object of the emotion.” In that regard, tragic characters “have to be within the reach of an audience's compassion” (175–79). When we see actors perform on stage, we become direct witnesses to their fate. In narratives, the poet/novelist achieves the same effects by providing us with realistic details that bring the characters to life so that we can begin to know them. In B. L. Ullman's understanding, “pitiful and fearful situations are better produced by the structure of the story than by actual scenes on the stage. But those, who through such scenes produce not fear but mere sensationalism, have nothing to do with tragedy” (26). Stories become relevant to readers or audiences in the totality of their elements, through which the story reflects plausible events to the readers themselves. Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the function of poetry, as indicated in the epigraph, goes to the core of the relation of narrative and ethics. Poetry enables the imagination to piece together, in ways acceptable to human flourishing, bits of human conduct, the elements of our happiness and misfortune. He explains in “Life in Quest of Narrative,” that by “means of poetry we learn how reversals and fortune result from this or that conduct, as this is constructed by the plot in the narrative” (23). Ricoeur differentiates between phronetic (prudential), and theoretical/scientific understanding of human nature. Narratives provide the former, while science provides the latter. In line with Ricoeur, Richard Kearney states in “Narrative and Ethics” that “what is peculiar to the ethical quality of narrative unders~<br>

Abstract: The resonance of Shaw's perspectives on health deepens in his later writings, from
      Back to Methuselah(1921) andThe Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism(1928) toDoctors' Delusions(1932) andFarfetched Fables(1948–50). In them, with an eye toward collective wellness, progressive growth, and enduring fitness, he promulgates interrelated theories of metabiology, socialism, despotism, and evolution. His constellation of superabundant vitality, political and metaphysical sensibilities, and practices of diet, exercise, and dress evokes a Victorian construction of healthiness, understood, according to historian Bruce Haley, as “a state of constitutional growth and development in which the bodily systems and mental faculties interoperate harmoniously under the direct motive power of vital energy or the indirect motive power of the moral will, or both. Its signs are, subjectively recognized, a sense of wholeness and unencumbered capability, and, externally recognized, the production of useful, creative labor.”
            For many at the time,18
         mens sana in corpore sanoconceptualized the healthy body as a vivarium for intellectual and moral growth while others were more radically materialist in positing happiness and good living as dependent upon the physiological self. In any case, as Haley maintains, the “practice of analogically or metaphorically connecting [spiritual health and bodily health] was habitual in Victorian epistemology[,] … the ideal of personal health a way of grasping the proper relation between the self as a whole … and the unity of moral and physical laws which transcend the self.”
            If consistent with their yoking of vivacity, integrity, and volition, Shaw flipped the hierarchy that privileged the corporeal, figuring the intellectual will as the unifying and driving force in health; in his words, “it is the mind that makes the body and not the body the mind.”19

Abstract: Like Ricoeur, Shaw invests his ethical capital in enhancing life, not in obeying rules. In the celebrated dream sequence of
         Man and Superman, Shaw includes duty as one of the seven deadly virtues that cause more detriment than benefit. For him, there is no act, however heinous, that some well-intentioned individual has not justified under the rubric of duty. The road to hell, Shaw said famously, is paved with the good intentions of those who in the aftermath of disastrous results defended themselves by claiming that duty compelled them to do what they did. For this reason, his recording angel is not keenly interested in what Kantian precepts individuals have or have not followed. What counts for the celestial Shavian bookkeeper is whether actions make the world better or worse, whether they reduce suffering and increase happiness—with happiness defined as the joy, the wellness, that comes from serving a purpose greater than narrow self-interest. “[C]onduct,” Shaw writes, “must justify itself by its effect upon life and not by its conformity to any rule or ideal.”
               And effecting life, in the sense Shaw understands it, is not a matter of dutifully genuflecting before conventional morality but of asserting the autonomous will, even if it engenders charges of immorality. “[L]ife,” he continues, “consists in the fulfilment of will”33
            
               and not in, as he reiterates in34
            The Sanity of Art, “the fulfilment of a moral law or of the deductions of reason.”
               Even so, Shaw makes it very clear that in crowning the will sovereign he is not championing anarchy. For every sanctioned principle his visionaries disavow, they honor nine. Shaw does not condone recklessness or wild abandon. Before the will sets events in motion, prudence and deliberative judgment, he believes, should prepare the way. He is well aware that we cannot dispense with tradition entirely and reasonably expect society to remain stable. Rat~<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>
