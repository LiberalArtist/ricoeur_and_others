  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: “In Search of Ariadne’s Thread” shows how Leff’s understanding of the classical tradition made him sympathetic to, yet critical of, the changes occurring in the field in the 1970s. Leff’s mixed response to these changes as a historian of rhetoric is interesting in its own right. More impressive, however, is how persistently he sought to work through the complexities of his response through elaborating (and continually modifying) his own “theory” of rhetorical criticism—close reading.<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  Abstract: AT THE HEART OF THIS book is a basic question that has heretofore largely eluded serious attention: How does history make its subject? Clearly, not all subjects are deemed historical at all times—that much has been clear from the beginnings of the discipline. What is required, then, for a particular object to become a proper subject of history? And what are the implications of such constraints for the history that is being written? In other words, what this book explores is the

  Author(s) CARPENTER EDMUND<br>
  Abstract: An experimental novelist earlier along (his objective, in the Rumanian phrase, to ʺsabotage historyʺ), Eliade became a historian of religion and the greatest living reinterpreter of the sacred dimensions of religion and thought, setting these against a contemporary ʺdesacralization of natureʺ through an impressive sweep of disciplines and cultures (shamanism, yoga, alchemy, etc.). His large work on shamanism is still the best guide to the subject, reinforcing an intuition long held of the shaman as artist and thinker as well as ʺmedicine man, priest and psychopompus.ʺ In the present co-editorʹs book, Technicians of the Sacred (the title itself is a<br>

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

The Reformation, in Febvre’s perspective, was thus a movement of European scope that brought into focus, in areas destined to stay Catholic as well as in those that broke away from the medieval church, tendencies that had been gathering force for centuries.

  Abstract: The late historian Albert Hourani once remarked that the Arabs are looking at themselves with eyes given to them by Europe. In a way, this is a study of these “eyes” and the things they saw, failed to see, or chose to ignore. By talking about eyes, Hourani aimed at something more substantial than a mere perspective or view. These eyes were nothing but new categories of knowledge, such as geography, anthropology, sociology, and, the subject of this book, the modern European tradition of making sense of the past.

  Abstract: The emergence of allegorical writing on a large scale and the mystical allegorical interpretation of non-epic literature are both developments rooted in the period of the authors we have been discussing. Neither of these developments is well understood, and if neither has found its historian, it is doubtless because the evidence is sparse, difficult to interpret, and often difficult to date. My comments will be limited to a sampling of texts providing evidence that the tradition of allegorical reading we have been examining was, in fact, crucially important in generating patterns of thought about literature and responses to literature that<br>

  Abstract: The sheer number of words for nature in Tokugawa texts dramatizes the concept’s many facets and renders vocabulary an obvious starting point for discussing nature’s multivalence. Despite this abundance of terms, Maruyama Masao’s critique of nature in early modern Japanese political thought relies almost exclusively on one word,
                  shizen(自 黑). That word, however, did not become standard until the 1890s. Indeed, before the 1890s,shizenappears to have been rather uncommon; certainly it was not a preoccupation in Confucian studies.

  Author(s) Pickstone John V.<br>
  Abstract: As is the case for many of his colleagues within the humanities, it is hard to pin one label on Franz Cumont (1868-1947). His work moves at the crossroads of history of religions, classical philology, ancient history, archeology and Orientalism. However, Cumont employed this multidisciplinarity in such a way as to make him a pioneer within the developing field of history of religions at the turn of the nineteenth century. In what follows I will focus mainly on Cumont as a historian of religion and on the renewing role which he played in the development of the history of religions<br>

  Abstract: Even as contemporary conditions precipitated a flood of peoples from the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean to the American mainland, a stream of English-speaking immigrants from the West Indies—a parallel diasporic movement—flowed to both Great Britain and the United States. These Hispanic and Commonwealth migratory streams are linked by the legacies of colonial history or what the historian Gordon Lewis (1983) describes as an “agrosocial system of slavery developed in its fullest and most harsh form” (2).

  Abstract: Today it is unusual to offer a comprehensive philosophical theory about the nature of human beings, or a theory about the origins of religion, or a theory of human culture in general. The French historian, literary critic, and philosopher René Girard (born 1923) has tried to do all of this with his mimetic theory. Though not a theologian, Girard has dealt in great detail with the biblical tradition—unusual for a secular social scientist. I will present one adoption of his theory into theological research: the “dramatic theology” that originated with the Swiss systematic theologian Raymund Schwager, S.J. (1935–2004),<br>

Historians are rarely given to apocalyptic prediction; rather, they typically warn us about repeating the history from which we have never learned.

  Abstract: The main difficulty in discussing chance in historiography is the fact that this subject has its own history, which as yet is unwritten. It is certainly impossible to discuss the role of chance in any given situation without first taking into account the whole terminology of the historian concerned. One needs to ask what is the opposite term that will exclude chance, or what is the overall term that makes it relative.

For the sake of argument, even if the historian comes to the conclusion that such-and-such miracle stories are not authentic—say, for instance, the changing of water into wine at Cana—the story as creation of the early church says some significant things about the historical Jesus: his participation in a banquet; his<br>

  Book Title: Child Sexual Abuse, Society, and the Future of the Church-  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Regan Hilary D<br>
  Abstract: In November 2012 the Australian federal government announced the establishment of a ‘Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse’. This Royal Commission was set up after many years of reports of sexual abuse in Australia within religious institutions of various Christian churches, some state government inquiries and in the context of inquiries in other countries, most notably Ireland. The Royal Commission began its first hearing in April 2013. It has been forecast that the Commission will be hearing submissions for a number of years from witnesses, both from those who ask to speak to the Royal Commissioners and from those who will be asked to appear before the Commission. At the same time as the establishment of the Royal Commission, the Catholic Church in Australia established a Truth, Justice and healing Council to oversee the Catholic Church’s engagement with the Royal Commission. This collection brings together essays from biblical scholars, a church historian, theologians, ministers of religion from a number of churches, lawyers and a psychologist. They each address the issues of sexual abuse, society and the church in the context of the Australian inquiries. The volume ends with an overview of the processes engaged with by the Catholic Church and the State in the Republic of Ireland and reactions to these inquiries. The volume of essays considers sexual abuse from the perspective of the victims. What is to be done about the mess we are in over clerical sexual abuse? That question is puzzling concerned people today. This diverse collection offers them profitable reading, wherever they are coming from. It has enough useful suggestions and ideas to stimulate the calm, intelligent discussion now demanded by our communities.’ Edmund Campion, Australian Catholic University.<br>

  Abstract: The decisive role Thomas Müntzer played during the German Peasants’ War of 1525 and his prophetic statement about the people being free later did encourage Friedrich Engels to see him as a precursor of all later revolutionaries. Engels’s interpretation is deeply influenced by the Left Hegelian historian Wilhelm Zimmermann, himself a politically radical scholar who first identified Thomas Müntzer as a revolutionary figure.¹ Engels sees the incidents during the revolution of 1525 and the following counterrevolution as paradigmatic for the historical dynamic of revolutions in general. Indeed, this also allows him to relocate the historical origin of the communist revolution<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: In

Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

                  History and Memory in Modern Ireland, McBride observes, “In Ireland, as is well known, the interpretation of the past has always been at the heart of national conflict … What is so striking about the Irish case is not simply the tendency for present conflicts to express themselves through the personalities of the past, but the way in which commemorative rituals have become historical forces in their own right” (ibid., 1–2).

  Author(s) Corfield Penelope J.<br>
  Abstract: All societies have ways of locating themselves in time and history. That is far from saying that the popular recall of the past is perfect. On the contrary, many are the complaints that people today – led especially, it seems, by the young – are constituting a heedless ‘Now Generation’ that knows nothing of olden times. ‘Speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left,’ the French historian Pierre Nora exclaimed dramatically in 1989.

This belief in the vast influence of ideas did not depend on political allegiance: the Polish poet (and anti-Communist) Czesław Miłosz pointed out that during the mid-twentieth century ‘the<br>

  Abstract: In Helmut Koester’s enormous contribution to the history of early Christianity, one of the things of which he has never tired of reminding us is the exuberance of Jesus’ followers that created, in the first decades of the movement’s existence, the wildest diversity of mythic portraits of him.¹ Students of the New Testament had often been blinded to this diversity by confusing the church’s canon with the canon of the historian.

  Abstract: This section considers the role of psychoanalysis in posing the question of sexual identity: a question crucial to psychoanalysis, but also one in which Freud’s own views have been most open to attack. Paul Robinson, an intellectual historian, begins by showing how an ambivalent or vacillating perspective toward homosexuality—within Freud’s own work—generates various perspectives on sexual desire and social norms in twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought. On one hand, as Robinson claims, “no one has done more to destabilize the notion of heterosexuality than Freud.” For Freud, the “homosexual object choice” is present in

It is the answer to the question for the roots of modernity. When and where did the modern world begin as we know and inhabit it? The historian investigates the past for the sake of the past. The quest for the roots of modernity, however, is not interested in the past as such but only as the beginning of something held to be characteristic of the present.

There is, of course, an angle of vision which completely shuts out the former for fear that to take note of anything positive about Stalin is to extenuate his unpardonable sins and mistakes. But for a historian of my background and generation it is difficult, if not impossible, to take such a narrow field of view and equate Stalin with Hitler, to see them as identical twins.

  Book Title: Pushkin's Historical Imagination-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

  Abstract: The editors of this volume have commissioned contributions extending from the axial age in the sixth century b c to the present day. This is the first to mention Europe by name in its title.¹ This volume has been conceived in such a way that the question of how Europe became diverse is to be answered by a medieval historian. It is in fact possible to take the view that Europe, as the historical entity familiar to us, first emerged in the Middle Ages; on this view, despite the fundamental achievements of Greco-Roman Antiquity and the ongoing impact of the<br>

  Author(s) Blanchard Pascal<br>
  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Author(s) Remmler Karen<br>
  Abstract: Lionello Venturi was the only art historian invited to come to the Pontigny encounters at Mount Holyoke, and he came twice.¹ The decision to invite Venturi was significant. No European art historian in exile had his credentials as an anti-fascist. If his physical stature was unusual—a gentle giant in the photographs shot at Mount Holyoke, he is always towering somewhat clumsily above his colleagues—his moral stature was equally unusual, especially in the dismal moral landscape of the twenty years of Italian Fascism.<br>

  Abstract: In her novel,
                  To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf allows her character, Mrs. Ramsey, a flash of unusual insight and illumination; the past is shaped by the present and the present is reshaped by the past. At any given instant, we both live history and live in history. For the dance historian, struggling with questions of historiography, the relationship of past and present is doubly complex. Theories of writing about history become more problematic in light of the ephemeral nature of what theater historian Joseph Roach calls the “transcendental signified”; the act of performance.¹ Because dance history is both enacted and<br>

  Book Title: The Allure of the Archives-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Natalie Zemon<br>
  Abstract: Arlette Farge's
      Le Goût de l'archiveis widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. InThe Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive's allure can forever change how we understand the past.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle theorized the relationship between history and fiction in the fourth century BC by writing that although the historian and the poet may use the same narrative tools, their “true difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen” (68). By that token, the Greek philosopher wrote, “poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular” (68). Yet Aristotle foresaw the central issue that would stymie narratologists and historians in the coming centuries: What happens when the poet writes about history? According to Aristotle, he remains a poet, not a historian: “for there is no reason<br>

At the same time, he adopted the European religion of Christianity, and used the European language of English for all of his published works and public addresses.² Thus he can be described as what literary historian Bernd Peyer calls a ʺtranscultural individualʺ (17), incorporating elements from different cultures into his identity.

  Book Title: Essays from the Edge-Parerga and Paralipomena<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): JAY MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Over his distinguished career as a European intellectual historian and cultural critic, Martin Jay has explored a variety of major themes: the Frankfurt School, the exile of German intellectuals in America during the Nazi era, Western Marxism, the denigration of vision in twentieth-century French thought, the discourse of experience in modern Europe and America, and lying in politics.
         Essays from the Edgeassembles Jay's writings from the intersections of this intellectual journey. Several essays focus on methodological debates in the humanities and social sciences: the limits of interdisciplinarity, the issue of national or universal philosophy, cultural relativism and visuality, and the implications of periodization in historical narrative. Others examine the concept of "scopic regime" and the metaphors of revolution and the gardening impulse. Among the theorists treated at length are Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault. The essays also include several of Jay'sSalmagundicolumns, dealing with subjects as varied as the new Museum of Modern Art in New York, the impact of Colin Wilson's The Outsider, and the demise of thePartisan Review.<br>

These journeys were considered to be ‘real’ by the men of the Middle Ages, even if they depicted them as ‘dreams’ (

  Abstract: Aristotle knew the answer. For him the matter of the division of labor between historiographer and poet was easily decided: the historiographer relates “what has happened,” and the poet “what might happen.”¹ In contrast to Plato’s devastating criticism of literature, Aristotle considered poetry to be of high value. In Aristotle’s eyes, literature dealt with problems of a more general and thus more significant nature, while the historian had to report about specific, and thus,
                  eo ipso,less important matters. Aristotle’s distinctions notwithstanding, one might assume that Calliope and Clio paid scant attention to whether they were called upon by rhapsodists<br>

Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

  Abstract: Depending on the speaker (children’s author, literary critic, art historian, advertising designer, painter) and the venue (bookstore, literature conference, gallery, marketing meeting), the term “image” implies an array of connotations, purposes, and audiences (Mitchell 1986). In the hybrid contexts of the twenty-first century—where visual culture, visual studies, and visual literacy are related but contested terms—“image” crosses disciplinary boundaries and characterizes multimodal activities in classrooms and communication. For children’s literature, an interdisciplinary field drawing upon many scholarly discourses, pedagogical approaches, and modes of creative expression, “image” is a complex and provisional term, always at play and in flux.<br>

The authors have maintained a balance between the historian's commitment to breadth and accuracy with the commitment of the systematic philosopher to the engaged point of view and to critical reflection. The result is a distinctive reference book made up of a series of philosophical studies -an invaluable companion to anyone who is searching for a panoramic but also reliable and challenging presentation of the philosophical ideas which shaped the last century.<br>

  Author(s) Stockwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: The Middle Ages should be studied and understood in its own terms and on its own premises, but a historian must also be able to explain progress, development and the great lineages of history. One of these great lineages is the history of democracy, in which the ‘Dark Ages’ are assumed to be a black hole. The experience of the Nordic countries during this period provides a worthy case study to test the accuracy of this assessment. The word ‘democracy’ directly translated from the Greek means a form of government where the people rule. In the city state (

  Abstract: Where does the history of the history of intelligence begin? As a self-conscious academic subject, intelligence history is widely understood to have started in the 1980s. In Britain, Christopher Andrew and David Dilks proclaimed a deliberate manifesto for intelligence historians in 1984, urging scholars to explore the ‘missing dimension’. Broadly contemporaneous with this, the American historian Richard Immerman asserted that it was important to incorporate covert action into any sophisticated understanding of foreign policy. The mid-1980s also saw the creation of the journal

Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

However, despite Frampton’s enormous influence in architectural culture around the world, the experiential core of his theory of critical regionalism remains unexamined. Unless we deeply comprehend how Frampton understood aesthetic experience, we will minimize its political thrust and import in architecture. Significantly, Frampton’s critics and commentators have not dealt with his peculiar understanding of experience in any detail. Many members of his generation, such as architect-historian Alan Colquhoun (b. 1921), focused instead on his opposition of the<br>

When it’s not there, as in the early Middle Ages, we either find reasons why it didn’t happen or imagine that, contrary to impressions, it did happen. But generally we assume that economic growth is natural, and that as soon as conditions permit, it appears. This is the basic view of the great economic historian Henri Pirenne, who postulated that in the newly peaceful conditions of the eleventh century, the dusty-footed merchants naturally began to ply their trade and markets sprang up.¹ More<br>

Anyone confronting this kind of gap, this murky area of not-knowing, whether labeled humanist or scientist or historian, will tend to project onto the noise one’s favorite theory.

  Abstract: Drawing on a vast and diverse archive in theory, testimony, and image and on such thinkers as Karl Marx, Walter Benjamin, Theodor W.

Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

The earliest breakthrough took place in classical antiquity around the time of Confucius (551–479 B.C.E.), when vari ous philosophical visions such as the Confucian, the Mohist, and the Daoist began to emerge out of the primeval cultural tradition that the author of the last chapter of the

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Seventeenth Century Through Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: The work of German cultural theorist and art historian Aby Warburg (1866-1929) has had a lasting effect on how we think about images. This book is the first in English to focus on his last project, the encyclopedic
         Atlas of Images: Mnemosyne. Begun in earnest in 1927, and left unfinished at the time of Warburg's death in 1929, theMnemosyne-Atlasconsisted of sixty-three large wooden panels covered with black cloth. On these panels Warburg carefully, intuitively arranged some thousand black-and-white photographs of classical and Renaissance art objects, as well as of astrological and astronomical images ranging from ancient Babylon to Weimar Germany. Here and there, he also included maps, manuscript pages, and contemporary images taken from newspapers. Trying through these constellations of images to make visible the many polarities that fueled antiquity's afterlife, Warburg envisioned theMnemosyne-Atlasas a vital form of metaphoric thought.<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

Indeed, one might reasonably argue that Herder approached virtually everything he did

  Abstract: The abbey of Flaxley, or Dene, in Gloucestershire, was a small Cistercian house, founded between 1148 and 1154 by the earl of Hereford, on the exact place where his father had died while hunting. Its historian would be short on records: a handful of charters, a few references in royal records, and one cartulary, written in the early thirteenth century, peculiar in its form. It is a roll, measuring 0.18 by 6.3 metres, recording ninety-seven items. This document provides a list of books preserved in the abbeyʹs library, and it has been well studied.¹<br>

In a book that elsewhere addresses issues of anti-Semitism, this last chapter fashions Hanslick as one of the “other Germans” of its title.

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: I see in the story sketched here at least two lessons to be drawn. One is methodological. When looked at from within philosophy, the history of the self tends to study the history of notions of the self; and it is further supposed that such notions, when not explicitly formulated, can be inferred from philosophical texts.
         Selfthus appears to be a transhistorical object whose manifestations and metamorphoses the philosopher‐historian can apprehend. It is in this vein that Paul Ricoeur remarks that the question of identity has always generated interest in puzzle cases and that humans have always been intrigued by religious beliefs about transmigration, immortality, and resurrection.129By implying that such beliefs exist as puzzle cases about a preexisting underlying question, Ricoeur turns around what I take to be their significance. Discussions about transmigration, immortality, or resurrection were not epiphenomenal expressions of a latent interest in the question of identity; they were, I would argue, consubstantial to that interest itself.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: In my role as historian of Americanist anthropology, I have long mused over the disproportionate influence of a small number of linguistic anthropologists over the discipline as a whole. Duranti cites two recent American Anthropological Association presidents who are linguistic anthropologists: I note that Jane Hill crosses into cultural as well as biological anthropology and Don Brenneis is difficult to identify solely as linguistic or cultural anthropologist. My own explanation tends toward the rhetoric of continuity within the three variants of linguistic anthropology. Because we are not contentious among ourselves, moving comfortably across both the subdisciplines of anthropology and the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities, linguistic anthropologists are often identified as effective mediators and synthesizers. The seminal role of Edward Sapir in the Rockefellersponsored interdisciplinary social science of the interwar years provides an early exemplar; Sapir persuaded his colleagues that Chicago sociology and psychology/psychoanalysis were not in conflict but explored different sides of a single coin (his metaphor). He had moved beyond descriptive and historical linguistics as handmaidens to ethnology into the psychological reality of the phoneme and the theory of culture.<br>

Abstract: According to Tesauro, the Son of God, the “sublime” writer of his own commentary, appears to the prophet as a scribe. His writing is first and foremost a sign of judgment and salvation (he marks the foreheads of those who do penance), but also of cleansing (he throws burning coal over the city). The linen cloth covering the body of the divine scribe will later become page and written text. Tesauro writes that, as a new Caesar, the divine scribe competes with himself, since he is at once supreme warrior and supreme historian of his own deeds. But as a written text, the divine scribe finds his literary model in Moses’s Decalogue.
      38If the two tablets contained the words that God dictated to Moses, in the two figures marked on both sides of the shroud God later revealed that the body of his Only‐Begotten Son brought his law to its fullness.<br>

Abstract: Yet, while this site cannot become one of collective experience, let alone collective memory, by subjecting it to this analysis I am dealing with it as a historical fact or place. In a different context, Susan Crane asked: “When is the personal historical?” She replied to her own question: “Whenever one is thinking about oneself historically.”
         98Crane herself was concerned primarily with the nature of historical consciousness as perceiving individually but signifying collectively and with the fine line running between autobiography and historiography. By both looking at myself as a historian describing and reflecting on a certain period and approaching myself as an agent of this period who is utilizing my own living memory as a historical source, I inevitably make some of the personal historical. For the duration of this text, at least, even the pharmacy assumes some historical meaning—metaphorically embodying, with its makeover from medical to clothing store, and with the physical although not functional presence of its former designation, the complex story of rupture and continuity between the Communist and post‐Communist era.<br>

Issue: jr.2006.86.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2006<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: The greatest fault line in the childhood studies literature, however, comes from the critique made of psychological models overall by what has been termed a “social sciences” approach that arose primarily in Europe in the late 1980s. Instead of examining individual children or family systems, this approach investigates children as they participate in and are constructed by their diverse cultures and societies. The origins of this methodology can be traced back to the historian Philippe Ariès, who famously argued in 1960 that experiences and interpretations of childhood have varied significantly across Western history (even if his narrower claim that childhood was invented only after the Middle Ages is generally rejected).
         11The seminal text in this new social sciences paradigm is the 1990 interdisciplinary volume, edited by the British sociologists Allison James and Alan Prout, titledConstructing and Reconstructing Childhood.12Here the argument is advanced that childhood—or rather “childhoods”—cannot be understood apart from how children interact with a range of diverse social variables such as poverty, class, gender, race, culture, and ethnicity. As James puts it elsewhere, “to see children as social actors is core to childhood studies. From that perspective, one sees children both as individuals who participate in a social world and as members of a social category defined by particular social, historical, and ideological processes.”13This new methodology has spawned a worldwide explosion in childhood studies across disciplines as varied as sociology, anthropology, law, medicine, cultural studies, media studies, education, economics, and public policy.14<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: In fact, it is this very confrontation between the claims of the collective singular, initiated by the expansion of capital (and its proxy, the nation‐state), and received special histories lived by peoples encountered along its route that brings into the immanent time of modernity the forceful contact of a history that has its own unique, internal time with countries like Japan and the colonized world outside of Euro‐America. The opening up of the globe and especially the creation of a world market often brought diverse cultures into violent clash in a synchronous drama that inevitably was recoded in a diachronic narrative upholding a chronologically uniform time ranging from barbaric to civilized and insisting on authorizing discrete comparisons. While it was in the context of this expanding world market that forms of unevenness were first perceived—then later described as noncontemporaneous contemporaneity—it was undoubtedly Marx who first called attention to the uneven development of material production and the coexistence of a dominant mode of production and surviving prior modes that often appear in “stunted form, or even travestied,” which thus “assign rank and influence to the others.”
         17And it is this contest between these prior modes of production and a universalizing world history (personified by the world market) appointed to unify and incorporate the plural special histories that is subsequently put into play by discussions in prewar Japan and elsewhere throughout the colonized and semicolonized worlds of the interwar period. Capital’s desire to reduce this plurality to a singular space of experience undermines itself because the space already bears the mark of difference, owing to its association with the nation‐state. But to say this is not to invite the possibility of an alternative modernity. As Ricoeur observed: “The paradox is great: history is proclaimed to be a world phenomenon by historian‐patriots” (MHF,p. 301). But what Ricoeur insis~<br>

Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: In her essay, “When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re‐Vision,” Adrienne Rich famously wrote, “Re‐Vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival” (Rich
      1972, 18). Rich’s words are well known. They have been quoted many times throughout the past three and a half decades, usually to underscore the need for women to revisit the past and get to know it differently in order to change the future.1Rich’s call for re‐vision, in the sense of retelling the stories that make up our common cultural heritage from the perspective of postcolonialism, feminism, and gender and queer studies, has transformed not only our understanding of the past but also our understanding of how we come to such an understanding. Literary history, historiography, and historytout courtwill never be the same again. The bell has tolled for thegrands récits, the grand narratives that served to bolster the legitimacy of the ruling social institutions (Lyotard1984). According to the French historian Pierre Nora, this fragmentation of History into histories is one of the reasons for the current obsession with memory. “The ‘democratization’ of history,” he argues, “takes the form of a marked emancipatory trend among peoples, ethnic groups, and even certain classes of individuals in the world today; in short, the emergence, over a very short period of time, of all those forms of memory bound up with minority groups for whom rehabilitating their past is part and parcel of reaffirming their identity” (Nora2002). Paradoxically, it would appear that it is precisely the re‐vision impulse that has led to what Andreas Huyssen has identified as “a fundamental crisis in our imagination of alternative futures” (2003, 2). Today, indeed, it is generally understood that history is a story that is told in the interest of a particular group of people and that there is always anoth~<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Augustine’s critique works less to discount civic virtue as a moral ideal than to dispute its goodness in the hands of the Romans. Indeed, his evaluation works on the assumption that civic virtue is a good that was honored in the breach. We should thus view the
         City of Godin its entirety as an expression of civic virtue given Augustine’s relentless critique of Roman rule throughout that work.61He avows that Rome was founded on fratricide over envy and the pursuit of glory, recalling the story of Cain and Abel and the founding of the earthly city.62Roman deities “allowed the most terrible and abominable evils to have free play,” not only privately in the mind but publicly in games and the theater.63Augustine cites Roman authorities themselves, including the historian Sallust, to support his view that the Roman republic changed “from the high of excellence to the depths of depravity,” including the permission of such things as the rape of the Sabine women.64Roman gods were clear projections of human desires and the quest for flattery rather than sources of objective sources of “right living.”65Recalling these and other facts of Roman history, Augustine writes, “I am sick of recalling the many acts of revolting injustice which have disturbed this city’s history; the powerful classes did their best to subjugate the lower orders, and the lower orders resisted—the leader of each side motivated more by ambition than by any ideas of equity and morality.”66<br>

Abstract: I want to begin this lecture by expressing my profound gratitude for the appointment as the Edward L. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics.
      1Renowned scholars have occupied the Edward L. Ryerson chair, ranging from its first holder, a physicist, to my immediate predecessor, Richard Saller, a distinguished historian. I am especially honored to be able to join this company of scholars. I am also bold enough to think that it is a tribute to this university that a theological ethicist is recognized in this way. The wide reach of inquiry at Chicago has always included the study of the religions and the many ways societies navigate moral and political challenges. The motto of this university is well chosen.Crescat scientia, vita excolatur: “Let knowledge grow from more to more and so be human life enriched.” This motto includes in principle the conviction that the growth of our knowledge about the religions will also, must also, lead to the increase of human life. Much of what I will have to say today about “humanizing religion” spins around these matters.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Abstract: Of course we can expand. What does it mean, for example, that film studies has never achieved as much institutional visibility in Japan as elsewhere, when it is a country whose film life over the last one hundred years has arguably been second only to that of the U.S.? There has always been feverish activity among private historian‐archivists (collectors of books, magazines, interviews, and ephemera) and critics (certain newspapers ran powerful columns for decades, journals sprouted from the 1920s on). As for large‐scale studies of the medium, written by professors or public intellectuals, the Japanese bibliography between 1913 and 1943 may be larger than its English language counterpart. In the postwar era, perhaps the name most Western film scholars might recognize is that of the prolific Tadao Sato, as some of his work has appeared in English and French. Yet only late in his career did this autodidact offer university courses. There simply was not much opportunity. With the exception of Nihon University, which claims to have introduced the subject in 1927, one does not find film studies taught within the university system until the 1960s when it was introduced within Nihon University's art department and Waseda's literature program. Waseda boasts a tremendous theater program and library, making it a natural place for the study of cinema to mature. In 1974, aiming to broaden their reach beyond their respective campuses, these universities, joined by a few others (the number has grown to thirty), formed Nihon Eizo‐gakkai (the Japanese Society of Image Arts and Sciences [JASIAS]), an umbrella organization fostering research in film, photography, and television. Their annual conference (where Christian Metz gave the keynote in 1981) and publication,
         Eizo‐gaku, make it similar to SCMS. In the late 1980s they addedIconicsas a second publishing venture, with nine issues thus far featuring articles in Western languages, many by leading Western scholars. Still, s~<br>

Abstract: One historian of Christian thought, referring explicitly to Coleridge alongside Friedrich Schleiermacher, argues that “the Romantics did nothing less than inaugurate a revolution in Western consciousness which, among other things, launched a new era in theology.”
         28Although Coleridge’s reflections on prayer were unpublished during his lifetime, they are involved in a watershed moment in the way that the religious subject is perceived.29Unlike previous discussions of prayer by J. Robert Barth, Boulger, and Muirhead, therefore, I want to place Coleridge within the tradition of reflections on prayer and show why he might be important. To start this analysis, we may note something characteristic about the kind of prayer that is emblematic for Coleridge’s analysis. Typically, from the very first patristic treatises, it has been the Lord’s Prayer that is central to the Christian understanding of the topic. The reflections of Origen, Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Luther, and Calvin all center on Matt. 6:9–13. Indeed, the Reformers saw prayer as a duty determined and expressed by the particular petitions enumerated by the Lord’s Prayer, which teach us for what it is proper to pray. Thus, Luther claims that “all the prayers which could ever be devised are in the Lord’s prayer,” while Calvin argues that “all other prayers lie outside the law and are forbidden.”30<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Dupré complements this account with an attentiveness to cultural continuities between the Enlightenment and preceding periods. Although historical thought during the eighteenth century tended to privilege the possibilities of the future over obligations to the past, at least some measure of faith in distant origins informs works such as Bossuet's
         Histoire universelleand even Vico'sScienza nuova, the latter imploring readers to preserve the “poetic wisdom” of the ancients or else sacrifice their present to a meaningless rationalism. Nor did eighteenth-century historians unanimously profess a belief in progress. Vico, for instance, viewed providence as a cyclical pattern of advancement and decline. Edward Gibbon, the century's most illustrious historian, went even farther in his refusal to accept Enlightenment claims of progress at face value. Despite his commitment to the idea that material and intellectual improvements could forestall decline, the imposing shadow of Rome cast doubt on the possibility that vast empires could avoid its fate in the end. Dupré's interpretation on this point differs from that of J. G. A. Pocock, who argues in his massive study ofThe Decline and Fallthat Gibbon usually resisted the temptation to equate Rome's landed empire with Britain's maritime, commercial network of colonies. Both Pocock and Dupré agree, however, that Gibbon's work effectively removed Christian ends from narratives of the past, thereby facilitating what Pocock calls “an emancipation of secular history from sacred” (Dupré, 187–228, quote on 195).43<br>

Abstract: Henry Turner's essay returns us to the very notion of “form” to underscore once again this key commonality that ties together literature and science, the literary scholar, the historian of science, and the scientist. In so doing, he works to dispel the text/action dichotomy, in part by noting that the “category of form” itself embraces “meaningful artifacts” of the sort that constitute the very material tools of the trade of the practices through which scientists make scientific knowledge: for example, “physical specimens, instrument readings, photographs, models.” Citing a range of examples that include Francis Bacon and Galileo, Turner importantly insists that form, while critical to making knowledge, is “never simply a tool of knowledge” but, rather, is always about the constitution of things, about “ontology.” Thus the forms utilized by scientists, whatever their particularity as “meaningful artifacts” may be in a given instance, also serve to gather together, to relate and draw into relation with one another, features of an experienced world that form associations as objects and as “enduring network[s]” of things. The final essay, by Colin Milburn, also highlights the dynamic nature of texts, particularly by drawing attention to their ability to constitute themselves as, and hence actively create, “assemblages.” His discussion of the relation of science to science fiction through processes collectively termed “modding” (processes of “reworking and transforming”) points to just this generative and dynamic property of texts that once again underscores the creative and pragmatic conjoining of text and action. By analyzing the specific forms that “mods” take in translating science fiction among “scientists as cultural consumers” into the work of the laboratory, Milburn provides testimony for one possible site where we may witness the continuing role that the fictive might play in science.<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects.

Abstract: The important point that emerges from this brief historical survey is that we must be careful not to impose anachronistic category distinctions on the evidence, such as that between “religious pollution” and infectious disease. For example, upon noting that Greek notions of pollution could be dependent on the social status of a person, Eireann Marshall comments: “[W]hile ancient Greeks did not necessarily perceive diseases as
         infectious, they thought thatreligious pollutioncould be spread to other people.”
               In a similar vein, the social historian Virginia Smith writes:39
            
               These authors would have been wiser to downplay such modern distinctions, as does Robert Parker in his more fitting characterization:Religious purity has a distinct role in the history of personal hygiene. It was not functional, not rational, and more often than not completely illusory; but it was a key cultural component that determined the lives and cleansing behaviour of very large numbers of people.
            
                     
               40
                  
               
         It is not clear that diseases ever truly became infectious in any other sense than this in Greek thought. Greeks were practically aware, in time of plague, that the disease could be contracted by contact, but in popular perception this may have been no more than an acute instance of the contagiousness of misfortune.

Abstract: En réaction à la double abstraction manifestée par la traditionnelle histoire des idées et par le structuralisme, l'histoire des intellectuels, à la fin des années 1980, a développé un programme de micro histoire sociale de la vie intellectuelle saisie à travers ses cadres concrets de fonctionnement tels les revues, les maisons d'éditions et les cercles de la sociabilité intellectuelle. Cette histoire culturelle des idées, attentive aux données impliquées par la transmission et la circulation des idées, a cependant délaissé l'examen des réalités langagières. Examiner comment le langage des œuvres modifie l'expérience des acteurs historiques reste un salutaire défi pour l'historien de la culture. Via l'étude des mécanismes de réception des œuvres, à travers celle des controverses, ou par le biais de la construction adéquate du contexte où joue la dialectique des faits moraux et sociaux, l'historien culturel, au carrefour de diverses disciplines voisines (histoire littéraire, sociologie des sciences, histoire conceptuelle du politique) s'inscrit au cœur des sciences humaines. /// Against the double abstraction shown by the traditional history of ideas and by structuralism, the history of intellectuals, at the end of the 1980s, developed a micro social history program of intellectual life seen through the study of journals, publishing houses and intellectual circles. This cultural history of ideas, attentive to the circulation and transmission of ideas, has nevertheless ignored the question of linguistic realities. Examining how the language of intellectual works modifies the experience of historical actors is a good challenge for the cultural historian. Through the study of how works are received, of the controversies, or through the appropriate construction of the context with the dialectical play of moral and social facts, the cultural historian, at the intersection of various related disciplines (literary history, sociology of science, conceptual history of politic~<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],

Abstract: En este artículo se analiza el trabajo de Natalie Z. Davis a partir de su compromiso con la historia de las mujeres. Una historia de las mujeres que la historiadora construye de la mano de una historia social renovada que, sin renunciar a una tradición que contempla el conflicto como motor de cambio, encuentra bajo la variopinta red de pertenencias sociales, rasgos identitarios que intervienen la relación individuo-grupo. Los espacios de poder y de disidencias se entrecruzan en el día a día, en el trabajo, el ocio, o los ámbitos de sociabilidad. En todos ellos, hombres y mujeres interactúan; hijos de una cultura común que tiende a definirlos en relación, pero en la que encuentran elementos suficientes para significar sus propios mundos. Using her commitment to women's history as a starting point, this article analyses the work of Natalie Z. Davis. This particular study of women's history that the historian makes in a renewed social history which without giving up on a tradition which has always used the conflict as a way to evolve, also finds identity traits that influence the relationship between the individual and his group in a variety of social issues. The spaces of power and dissidences intertwine in the day to day, in the workplace, in free time, or in areas of sociability. In all of these, men and women interact; as descendants of a common culture which tends to define them as one, but in which they finally find enough principles to define their own worlds.<br>

Author(s): ALBINUS LARS<br>
Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire contrefactuelle — «que se serait-il passé si?» — connaît actuellement un certain engouement éditorial et a fait l'objet dans les pays anglophones d'un vigoureux débat il y a une dizaine d'années, qui s'est achevé sur un consensus prudent. Pourtant, loin de ces usages polémiques dont les raisons sont explorées ici, un examen plus serré suggère, comme l'avait déjà identifié Max Weber, qu'il s'agit aussi d'un mode plus ordinaire du raisonnement, notamment en sciences sociales. La question n'est donc pas de savoir s'il faut promouvoir ou rejeter cette démarche, mais plutôt, à partir d'une lecture interdisciplinaire, de détecter les enjeux, risques et propositions que recouvre son explicitation. Trois aspects sont analysés ici: le rapport histoire/ fiction, le poids du déterminisme et de la causalité, les implications politiques d'une attention aux futurs non advenus. À partir du constat des tensions que fait saillir l'examen contrefactuel, l'article reprend ensuite de manière détaillée la critique de divers usages courants, et propose d'autres manières de faire qui semblent plus pertinentes, certaines évidentes, d'autres expérimentales, dans le but d'enrichir la boîte à outils historienne. Favorisant, ainsi, la relecture des sources, le rejet de la téléologie, l'analyse de moments critiques, l'élaboration de conceptions plus fines et discontinues des temporalités, et la mise en œuvre d'exercices pédagogiques et ludiques, la démarche contrefactuelle permet surtout au chercheur d'appréhender la question essentielle, mais délicate, des possibles en histoire. Counterfactual history — "what would have happened if?" — is currently receiving keen editorial interest and was, roughly ten years ago in anglophone countries, the subject of vigorous debate, which concluded with a cautious consensus. Yet, far from any polemical uses, the reasons for which are explored here, closer examination suggests, as already identified by Max Weber, that it is also a more ordinary way~<br>

Abstract: Text-books of former days have been rightly criticised for using the Bible in a lazy manner as a «mine of premises». The same reproach would apply to the historian of exegesis who would make no attempt to situate the texts in the horizon of their ancient authors. While the cultural context in which they thought and wrote was predominantly hellenistic, they owed much also to biblical methods of reading. It would, moreover, be difficult to understand their works without taking into account the polemic context in which they were written. Throwing light on each other, the great theologies allow us to draw the figure of Jesus Christ in mutually complementary perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Une des thèses les plus importantes de l'historien français Alphonse Dupront affirme que la mort de la Chrétienté est un élément crucial de la modernité européenne. Le présent article, fondé sur une interprétation de la correspondance diplomatique de Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, ambassadeur de France à Venise durant l'Interdit vénitien (1606-1607), étudie la survie de l'idée de Chré tienté au début du XVIIe siècle. À travers les lettres de Canaye de Fresnes, on peut voir qu'un usage catholique mais antiromain du concept de Chrétienté semble possible. A favourite assumption of the french historian Alphonse Dupront is the idea that the death of Christendom is a crucial element of european modernity. The present work, based on an interpretation of the diplomatic dispatches of Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, the french ambassador in Venice during the Venetian Interdict (1606-1607), deals with the survival of the idea of Christendom at the beginning of the 17th century. Through the letters of Canaye de Fresnes, one can see that a catholic but antiromanist use of the conceipt of Christendom seems possible.<br>

Issue: i23653923<br>

Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with thos~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the political and mnemonic programme to be found in the last books of the British historian and thinker Tony Judt. The author of this article assumes that the final period of Judt's writing, in which he produced Ill Fares the Land, The Memory Chalet, and the posthumously published discussion with Timothy Snyder entitled Thinking the Twentieth Century, is dependent on a kind of 'art of memory'. For Judt, being terminally ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and thus condemned to immobility, this method became not so much—as in the case of its classic varieties—a technology of remembering, as a manner of recognizing and analyzing the contemporary world by turning to his own biography. The purpose was to construct a 'political testament' for the Western world in a time of crisis whose roots, according to Judt, can be found in the supremacy that 'economic' thinking has achieved over traditional political thought. In a gesture reminiscent of the Stoic 'techniques of the self' described by Michel Foucault, Judt, by exploiting his own no less complicated biography and identity, tries to throw light on the complicated history of the 20th century, containing the sources of 'our contemporary ills'. Biography and history thus meet here in a 'work of memory' whose horizon and catalyzer is the perspective of death, and whose stake is the idea of a political community experiencing, according to Judt, a period of inertia.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Abstract: Les liens entre anthropologie et histoire, qui ont été très forts depuis les années 1960, semblent parfois se distendre depuis deux décennies. À partir d'un point de vue localisé, celui d'un historien des derniers siècles du Moyen Âge, cet article cherche à s'interroger sur la réalité actuelle des formes d'échange scientifique entre les deux disciplines. Tout en rappelant l'importance de l'anthropologie historique et des objets de recherche partagés par les historiens et les anthropologues, il cherche à mettre en évidence une autre perspective de travail, en montrant comment les interrogations des anthropologues sur l'historicité, sur la forme et le statut de l'information recueillie durant leur travail de terrain, ou sur leur propre engagement subjectif par rapport à ce terrain, offrent aux historiens, qui sont confrontés à des questionnements parallèles, des ressources nouvelles pour prolonger la fécondité des échanges interdisciplinaires. The links between anthropology and history have been very tight since the 1960s but seem to have loosened during the past two decades. From a very « localized » viewpoint as a historian of the latter part of the Middle Ages, questions are raised about the current reality of forms of scientific exchanges between these two disciplines. While recalling the importance of historical anthropology and of subjects of research shared by historians and anthropologists, another perspective of work is opened by showing how anthropologists' interrogations about historicity, the form and status of the information gathered during fieldwork, or about their own subjective commitments in relation to the field, provide historians, who face parallel interrogations, with new resources for fertilizing multidisciplinary exchanges.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de François Laplanche prend délibérément pour objet la longue durée : l'exégèse biblique entretient un rapport constant au Texte originel et l'historien ne peut s'exonérer de connaître les interprétations patristiques et médiévales de la Bible. L'histoire d'une pratique de lecture savante est ici réintégrée à l'intérieur de l'ensemble de la culture, de la société et des événements d'une période donnée. Prenant pour centre d'analyse les théologiens calvinistes de Saumur vers 1620-1670, François Laplanche montre que, tandis que leur système demeure arrimé à l'orthodoxie réformée, ils la minent et conduisent à une désacralisation de l'Écriture par un double éloignement : éloignement de l'origine puisque la disqualification de l'Ancien Testament le transforme en objet d'histoire; éloignement de la fin des temps par la récusation catégorique du prophétisme et du millénarisme. The work of François Laplanche deliberately deals with long duration: biblical exegesis maintains a constant relationship to the original Text and the historian cannot exempt himself from knowing the patristic and medieval interpretations of the Bible. The history of scholarly reading is here reinstated within the culture, society and events of a given period. Taking as the center of his analysis the Calvinist theologians of Saumur around 1620-1670, François Laplanche shows that, while their system remains linked to reformed orthodoxy, they are undermining it and go towards a desecration of Scripture via a double remoteness: remoteness from the origin since the disqualification of the Old Testament transforms it into an historical object; remoteness from the end of time via the adamant disqualification of prophecy and millenarianism. La obra de François Laplanche toma deliberadamente como objeto la larga duración: la exégesis bíblica establece una relación constante con el Texto original y el historiador no puede eximirse de conocer las interpretaciones patrísticas y medievales de la Biblia.~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Article Title: Historical Understanding: The Ch'an Buddhist Transmission Narratives and Modern Historiography<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342968<br>
Date: 2 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): LaCapra Dale S.<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflection on these differences.<br>

Abstract: Los historiadores porfían en encontrar la verdad y defender la libertad de interpretarla. Las diversas «verdades» conllevan la construcción permanente de la historia, para lo cual nos vemos en la necesidad de insistir en la inagotable búsqueda de los rastros y restos del pasado. Tanto historiadores como historiados, se encuentran en la misma condición de recordar acompañados. Ello nos compele a saber escuchar para entender las formas de olvido y contribuir a que la memoria aflore y estimule el ejercicio mnemotécnico. Como advertía Frances Yates, la memoria es un arte, y por tanto, el historiador asume que frente al el proceso destructor del olvido, la historia logra reconstruirse, siempre y cuando exista una memoria que perviva. Historians insist on finding truth and defending the freedom to interpret it. The different «truths» entail the permanent building of history, to which end we need to keep endlessly on looking for traces and remains of the past. Historians, as well as their subjects, find themselves in the situation of remembering accompanied. This compels us to know how to listen to forms of oblivion and to contribute to bring memory to the surface and stimulate the mnemonic exercise. As Frances Yeats warned, memory is an art, and therefore the historian assumes that, before the destructive process of oblivion, history achieves its reconstruction as long as there is a memory surviving.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo proporciona una lectura actualizada de las llamadas 'novelas históricas' o 'novelas de ciudad' de Carlos Droguett. En particular, sus novelas centradas en la conquista y fundación de la ciudad de Santiago (100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano) señalan la primera coordenada del proyecto narrativo droguettiano orientado a reelaborar y reescribir la historia chilena y latinoamericana, en una historiografía-literaria que busca sus fuentes, su prueba documental, en el enorme archivo conformado por toda esa sangre, por todas esas muertes soslayadas "con silencio o con ruido". 100 gotas de sangre y 200 de sudor y Supay el cristiano constituyen las primeras páginas de lo que aquí denominaremos "La Historia de Chile según Carlos Droguett". Pero, además, ambas novelas serían tributarias de la fuente documental previamente elaborada y narrativizada por el historiador Crescente Errázuriz en su Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia. The present article provides an up-to-date reading of the so called 'historical novels' or 'city novels' by Carlos Droguett. In particular, his novels focused on the conquest and founding of the city of Santiago (100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano) mark the droguettian narrative project first's coordinate, oriented towards a remaking and rewriting of the Chilean and Latin American history, in a literary-historiography which looks for its sources, its documentary evidence, within the enormous archive conformed by all that blood, all those deaths eluded "with silence or noise". 100 Gotas de Sangre y 200 de Sudor and Supay el cristiano are the first pages of what we here call Chilean History according to Carlos Droguett. But, in addition, both novels would be tributary of the documentary source previously elaborated by the historian Crescente Errázuriz in his Historia de Chile bajo Pedro de Valdivia.<br>

Author(s): Vidal Laurent<br>
Abstract: Cet article retrace le parcours singulier d'Arlette Farge. L'historienne y évoque sa propre trajectoire scientifique, parlant des rencontres qui ont joué un rôle déterminant dans l'évolution de ses recherches (Philippe Ariès, Michel Foucault). Elle revient sur ses ouvrages, rappelant l'intention qui a présidé à leur élaboration dans le contexte dans lequel ils ont été préparés et écrits. Enfin, l'entretien est l'occasion pour l'historienne d'évoquer son rapport à la discipline et aux autres sciences sociales, ou encore ses manières de lire les archives et d'écrire pour construire une « histoire de l'infime ». This article recounts the unusual intellectual journey undertaken by Arlette Farge. The historian recalls the scientific path she followed, including a discussion of her encounters with Philippe Ariès and Michel Foucault, both of which played a decisive role in the development of her research. She goes back over her published works, remembering the intentions that motivated them and the context in which they were researched and written. Finally, the interview offers the historian an opportunity to talk about her relationship to the discipline of history itself and to the other social sciences, and how she goes about reading historical records and writing in order to construct a "history of minute details".<br>

Abstract: Cet entretien, réalisé à l'occasion de la parution du dernier ouvrage d'Arno J. Mayer, Les Furies, permet de retracer l'itinéraire intellectuel de cet historien du contemporain nourri de science politique et d'un marxisme hétérodoxe. Il met en lumière tout l'intérêt des méthodes et des questionnements d'un chercheur soucieux de penser de manière comparée les moments de crise sociale et politique en Europe et d'en comprendre la violence. Les prises de position politiques d'A. J. Mayer éclairent son œuvre et dessinent les difficultés et les originalités d'un parcours engagé dans l'université américaine depuis la fin des années 1950. This interview, conducted on the occasion of the publication of Arno J. Mayer's latest book, Les Furies, recounts the intellectual itinerary of this historian of the contemporary period, nurtured by political science and unorthodox Marxism. It brings out the interesting aspects of the methods and questioning used by this researcher who studies moments of social and political crisis in Europe comparatively and aims at understanding their violence. The political positions taken by A. J. Mayer help explain his writings and indicate the problems and originality of the path taken by a committed scholar who has been working in American universities since the end of the 1950s.<br>

Abstract: Ce sont quelques temps forts du parcours scientifique de l'historien Carlo Ginzburg qui sont abordés dans cet entretien. Évoquant les rencontres et les lectures qui ont déterminé sa formation d'historien, évaluant l'aventure de la microhistoire, C. Ginzburg aborde également les caractéristiques majeures de sa démarche, et revient sur les principaux débats auxquels il a pris part, ainsi que les questions que ne manquent pas de soulever ses travaux: le statut des témoignages figurés en histoire, les rapports entre morphologie et histoire, les modalités de la connaissance en histoire. The highlights of the scientific career of the historian Carlo Ginzburg are discussed in this interview. C. Ginzburg discusses the encounters and readings that had a decisive effect on his training as an historian and evaluates the adventure of micro-history. He also discusses the main features of his approach and comes back to the principal debates in which he has taken part, as well as the questions inevitably raised by his work: the status of figurative testimony in history, the relationship between morphology and history and the methods of historical knowledge.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i345907<br>
Date: 2 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): Althusser Nicole<br>
Abstract: This article, written by a Russian cultural historian, analyzes the concept of "ideology" in the work of Clifford Geertz and his role in understanding the figurative nature of ideology as a cultural system. The author compares Geertz's semiotic approach to culture with the semiotics of culture developed by Russian theorists, particularly Yuri Lotman, showing the convergence and divergence of the two different national traditions. This understanding of the nature and functions of ideology opens new possibilities for discussing the tortured relations of ideology and literature, showing the way fiction can affect the formation of ideological systems and influence practical politics. The analysis is illustrated by examples from Russian political life of the 1990s, when revolutionary changes demanded new sets of ideological metaphors that in their turn shaped the direction of events.<br>

Abstract: Le problème de la représentation du passé ne commence pas avec l'histoire mais avec la mémoire qui a le privilège de la reconnaissance intuitive et directe des images gardées de l'impression en nous de la marque du passé, avec toutes les difficultés liées à la fiabilité relative de la mémoire. Le problème chemine à travers tous les stades de l'opération historiographique: témoignage et archive, — explication/compréhension —, représentation narrative et rhétorique au niveau du texte final de l'historien. Entre la mémoire et l'histoire, l'ordre de priorité reste indécidable. /// The problem of the representation of the past does not begin with history, but with memory. Memory has the capacity to recognize intuitively and directly the images we keep of the impression the past makes on us, with all the uncertainties stemming from its questionable reliability. This problem concerns all stages of the historiographic process: testimony and archives — explanation/comprehension — narrative and rhetorical representation during the writing of the historian's final text. But one thing remains certain, it is impossible to give priority to either memory or history.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i30245669<br>
Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Glasner-Heled Galia<br>
Abstract: Among the prominent writers on the Holocaust, Yehiel Dinur, who wrote under the pseudonym Ka-Tzetnik, offers his readers the most horrific, almost unbearable reading experience. This article examines the reader-writer relationship in Holocaust literature by considering whether readers of Ka-Tzetnik’s works are able, in Ricoeur's terms, to appropriate or actualize the meaning of a literary text that discloses a mode of "being-in-the-world" that is intensely unbearable and seemingly inexpressible. Interviews were conducted with a group of people who, through their professions as writer, literary scholar, educator, or historian, are concerned with such issues. Two main responses to Ka-Tzetnik were discerned: Some readers perceive him as so warped by his experiences that his extreme, even "insane", vision actually stands as a barrier between the reader and the reality of the Holocaust. For others, it is precisely the unrestrained portrayal of the insane Holocaust reality that is identified with an unmediated "true" Holocaust experience. The first group of readers does not believe that Ka-Tzetnik’s texts can be appropriated. But the reading experience of the second group can also not be characterized as appropriation: for them Ka-Tzetnik creates a primarily emotional core experience, which cannot be deconstructed to reconstruct or actualize the text in the reader's own terms, in the present. The case of Ka-Tzetnik, therefore, raises the difficult question of whether the Holocaust can be understood through a dialogical process of deconstruction and appropriation, or whether Holocaust literature should offer an overwhelming, totalizing experience in which precisely the inability to deconstruct and appropriate the text ensures the communication of the inconceivable.<br>

Abstract: En quoi le western, ce genre cinématographique si typiquement américain, peut-il aider les historiens à réfléchir sur leurs propres méthodes? En comparant les œuvres de John Ford et de Michael Cimino, Christian Delage nous invite à revenir sur la question des temporalités et des représentations de la durée. /// The filmmaker reconstructs the past rather than reconstituting it, and thus meets the historian. The analysis of two major works by John Ford and Michael Cimino shows how the cinema historicizes a past event through the indirect agency of the narrative. In the fiction presented to the audience, the filmmaker, like the historian, faces representations inscribed in general history, while simultaneously modifying its meaning. American cinema carries on an almost ontological relation with duration and time; the question of its truthfulness presents the same methodological challenge as that driving contemporary historical research.<br>

Author(s): Michelet François<br>
Abstract: Pour dépasser les termes du dialogue contemporain sur le "couple mémoire/histoire", pour prolonger aussi la méditation sur le travail de Paul Ricœur qu'il vient de publier dans la Revue historique (n° 619, juillet-septembre 2001), François Bédarida met ses pas dans ceux de Péguy. Un Péguy pour qui "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". Tout l'article montre pourtant que Péguy-Janus, fidèle à Bergson, a aussi promis la réconciliation de Mnémosyne et Clio, comme il se doit entre mère et fille. Dans un passage célèbre de Clio, Péguy, on le sait, a soutenu que "l'histoire et la mémoire forment un angle droit". L'article dit l'origine de cette distinction, à l'heure du retournement historiographique conduit par la nouvelle Sorbonne, par Laville, Langlois et Seignobos, ennemis juré du patron des Cahiers de la Quinzaine, grand pourfendeur du "parti intellectuel" et de "l'histoire historisante". Il signale aussi, et très fortement, que Péguy, en bon et fidèle bergsonien, a constamment tenté de dépasser les fausses oppositions entre histoire et mémoire au nom de l'affrontement fécond entre Clio et Chronos, entre le passé et la vie, et qu'il n'a pas cessé de rappeler la haute responsabilité de l'historien dans la compréhension du monde. /// It is well known that in a famous passage in Clio, Péguy said "history and memory form a right angle." The article details the origin of this distinction during the historiographic reversal led by the new Sorbonne, Laville, Langlois and Seignobos, sworn enemies of the director of the Cahiers de la Quinzaine, great destroyer of the "intellectual party" and "historicizing history". It also says that Péguy, the good and faithful Bergsonian, constantly tried to overcome the false oppositions between history and memory in the name of the productive clash between Clio and Chronos, between the past and life, and he never stopped recalling the historian's enormous responsibility in the comprehension of the world.<br>

Author(s): Ricœur François<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricœur l'affirmait presque clandestinement depuis un demi-siècle. Voilà qu'il le répète, hautement et avec de bien meilleures chances d'être entendu, dans un livre très important pour l'avenir. Oui, en histoire on peut tenter d'atteindre le vrai par l'écriture. Oui, raconter c'est déjà expliquer et maîtriser le temps. Oui, l'événement engendre lui-même du sens, la mémoire peut être heureuse, le passé palpite dans le temps présent. Ricœur donne (redonne?) ainsi espoir à l'historien, dont le travail "rend nos attentes plus déterminées et notre expérience plus indéterminée". François Dosse dit l'opportunité de ce "moment Ricœur". L'occasion est enfin offerte à la communauté historienne d'un vrai dialogue avec la philosophie grâce à la publication de l'ouvrage majeur de Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. Ce n'est pas la premiére fois que Ricœur tente ce dialogue avec les historiens puisque sa première intervention dans ce domaine remonte à un demi-siècle. Elle fut peu entendue en un temps, les années 1950, peu propice aux épistémologies métisses. Sa trilogie sur le temps parue entre 1983 et 1985, "Temps et récit" eut un peu plus d'échos, mais elle fut pour l'essentiel tenue en lisière, considérée comme œuvre pour philosophes. Cette fois, en ce "temps des doutes" et d'interrogation des historiens sur les notions qu'ils utilisent au quotidien dans leur pratique: la vérité, la causalité, la mémoire, le récit, le temps, le moment semble venu de prendre la dimension de l'apport de Ricœur à la discipline historique, d'autant qu'il a fait, avec la rigueur qu'on lui connaît, le détour par les travaux des historiens d'aujourd'hui, dont il est le lecteur attentif. /// Now is the moment for a real dialogue with philosophy with the historian community thanks to the publication of the major work of Paul Ricœur, La mémoire, l'histoire, l'oubli. This is not the first time that Ricœur has attempted this dialogue with historians since his first intervention in this area ~<br>

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity.

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Abstract: Dans cet article, nous évoquerons la question des témoignages de la Shoah et des circonstances de leur énonciation. A cet effet, nous décrirons cet objet sociodiscursif particulier qu'est le témoignage, en détaillant ses composantes définitoires (certification autobiographique, pacte de référentialité, portée collective, etc.), en réfléchissant sur les conditions de son accréditation et en le comparant aux autres modalités et stratégies discursives (discours de l'historien, récit littéraire, etc.) utilisées pour transmettre cette réalité extrême et non partagée de la déportation et de l'expérience concentrationnaire. In this paper, I focus on the question of the testimonies of the Shoah and the circumstances of their creation. The testimony, a specific sociodiscursive object, is described by detailling its defining elements (autobiographical certification, referentiality pact, collective thrust, etc.), by reflecting on the conditions of its accreditation and by comparing it to the other discursive modalities and strategies (the discourse of the historian, literary accounts, etc.) used to convey the extreme and unshared reality of deportation and the experience of concentration camps.<br>

Abstract: The French philosopher and intellectual historian Pierre Hadot (1922-2010) is known primarily for his conception of philosophy as spiritual exercise, which was an essential reference for the later Foucault. An aspect of his work that has received less attention is a set of methodological reflections on intellectual history and on the relationship between philosophy and history. Hadot was trained initially as a philosopher and was interested in existentialism as well as in the convergence between philosophy and poetry. Yet he chose to become a historian of philosophy and produced extensive philological work on neo-Platonism and ancient philosophy in general. He found a philosophical rationale for this shift in his encounter with Wittgenstein's philosophy in the mid-1950s (Hadot was one of Wittgenstein's earliest French readers and interpreters). For Hadot, ancient philosophy must be understood as a series of language games, and each language game must be situated within the concrete conditions in which it happened. The reference to Wittgenstein therefore supports a strongly contextualist and historicist stance. It also supports its exact opposite: presentist appropriations of ancient texts are entirely legitimate, and they are the only way ancient philosophy can be existentially meaningful to us. Hadot addresses the contradiction by embracing it fully and claiming that his own practice aims at a coincidence of opposites (a concept borrowed from the Heraclitean tradition). For Hadot the fullest and truest way of doing philosophy is to be a philosopher and a historian at the same time.<br>

Abstract: El artículo pretende responder a alguno de los interrogantes abiertos en la historiografía internacional ante una actualidad saturada de memoria y las implicaciones político-sociales derivadas del «uso público de la historia». Desde esta perspectiva, se rastrean los conceptos utilizados para explicar el tratamiento propiamente histórico de los problemas, subrayar las polémicas esenciales y derivarlas hacia el espacio público en el que se celebran las ceremonias de la consagración memorial. El artículo continúa con una rápida visión panorámica del desarrollo de la historiografía contemporánea en las últimas décadas del siglo xx, distinguiendo tres grandes espacios/momentos de convergencia y enfrentamiento de la memoria con la práctica historiográfica. Y termina con una afirmación acerca de la posición del historiador, de su condición histórica y sus implicaciones con el mundo vertiginoso del presente donde la memoria y el olvido aparecen como dos puntos de referencia irrenunciables para el conocimiento de la historia contemporánea. The article pretends to give an answer to some of the open questions in the international historiography: a present time overloaded with memory and the social and political implications derived from the «public use of history». The concepts used to explain the historic treatment proper are investigated from that perspective; the essential polemics are underlined and directed towards the public space in which the ceremonies of the memorial consecration are celebrated. The article continues with a fast panoramic vision of the development of contemporary historiography in the last decades of the XXth century following three important moments / spaces of confrontation of the memory with the historiographie practice. It ends dealing with the position of the historian, his historical condition and his implication in the rapid world of the present where memory and oblivion appear as two unrenounceable reference points for the knowledge of the con~<br>

Abstract: El interés por la búsqueda de soluciones a los déficits de legitimación del proyecto europeo ha provocado en las ciencias sociales y en la historia un enorme interés por el estudio de la idea de espacio público. Éste ha sido resultado del vínculo establecido por sectores intelectuales cercanos al europeísmo entre el desarrollo de un espacio público europeo con la reducción de la distancia existente entre las políticas públicas, las instituciones y la ciudadanía europea. Desde la perspectiva del historiador, sin embargo, el estudio del espacio público europeo no puede tener como único objetivo apoyar la creación de una identidad colectiva supranacional a partir de la construcción de un «relato europeo», destinado a restituir la ficción de una comunidad histórica de pertenencia, ni tampoco arrogarse la misión de fijar histórica y culturalmente las fronteras de Europa. La utilidad social de su estudio reside en la misma ambición de contribuir a la creación de ese espacio público europeo a partir de la promoción de valores que se asocian con Europa, como la libertad, la tolerancia y la democracia, sin renunciar por ello ni al imprescindible ejercicio de crítica ni al análisis riguroso de nuestro pasado inmediato. The interest in the search for solutions to the lacks of standing in the European project has caused a huge interest in the study of the idea of public sphere in all the Social Sciences disciplines, also in the History. An interest that is a result of to have been linked the development of a European public sphere with a reduction in the distance between public policy, institutions and European citizenship in intellectual groups close to Europeanism. However, from the historian s perspective, the study of the European public sphere can not have the sole aim to support the creation of a supranational collective identity from the construction of a «European story» designed to restore the fiction about a historic community of membership, as well as not to assume t~<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Abstract: Godefroid Kurth, historien méthodique rigoureux du début du XXe siècle, et Jean d'Outremeuse, chroniqueur prolixe mais brouillon du XIVe siècle, partagent a priori le même « métier », celui d'historien. Pourtant, entre ces deux personnages se dresse un gouffre abyssal, celui de deux visions de l'histoire entièrement opposées. Pour l'un, l'histoire est constituée d'événements assurés, reconstruits par une minutieuse étude des sources. Pour l'autre, l'histoire est un puits d'anecdotes propres à intéresser un public, elle est construite à coups de légendes, d'inventions personnelles qui visent à la vraisemblance aussi bien qu'à créer un véritable récit historique. Lorsque Godefroid Kurth a publié en 1910 son étude critique sur Jean d'Outremeuse, celui-ci n'était plus à même de se défendre. Il fut en conséquence lentement oublié, et sa vision de l'histoire vouée aux gémonies. Quel regard l'historien actuel doit-il porter à cette querelle? L'évolution de l'historiographie moderne, en particulier le linguistic turn, qui a insisté sur l'aspect narratif de toute histoire, doit-il le porter à réhabiliter le chroniqueur? Ne faudrait-il pas tout autant comprendre la démarche de l'un et de l'autre des protagonistes pour les voir tous deux, malgré leur statut d'écrivains de l'histoire, comme des sujets, des témoins de l'histoire et de leur époque? Godefroid Kurth, a methodological and rigorous historian from the beginning of the twentieth century, and Jean d'Outremeuse, prolix but disorganized chronicler from the fourteenth century, seem to share the same « profession », that of historian. Between the two, however, stands a gaping abyss due to two visions of history totally opposed. For the first one, history is made of positive events, rebuilt by a meticulous study of the sources. For the second one, history is a well of anecdotes useful to interest an audience : it is built with legends, personal inventions, whose aim is to create plausibility as well as a true historical narr~<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Comme n'importe quel éditeur scientifique, l'économiste qui entend diffuser les écrits de ses prédécesseurs est confronté à une problématique invariable : publier quoi et comment, par delà le choix de qui. Les difficultés posées par cette problématique, dans le champ de notre discipline, ne se distinguent pas radicalement de celles qui interviennent dans d'autres domaines, y compris en littérature. Certes, le traitement de ces difficultés mobilise à de nombreux égards des compétences qui ne sont habituellement pas l'apanage de l'historien de la pensée économique, mais il requiert aussi des capacités analytiques que ce dernier a coutume de reconnaître comme les siennes propres. Il demeure que l'activité editoriale est une pratique savante à laquelle l'historien de la pensée économique n'accorde ordinairement que peu d'attention. Pourtant, puisque la littérature primaire dont s'alimente notre discipline est ici en jeu, l'affirmation institutionnelle et la diffusion de celle-ci dépendent d'une telle pratique. Like any other scientific editor, the economist who intends to spread the writings of his predecessors is faced with constant problems, beyond the question of who he will publish: what he should publish and how he should publish it. In the field of our discipline, the difficulties raised by these questions are not radically different from those which occur in other disciplines, including literature. Of course, in many respects dealing with these difficulties implies skills which are not usually the prerogative of the historian of economic thought. Nevertheless it also requires analytical abilities that the latter is in the habit of regarding as being his own. The fact remains that editing is a scholarly practice to which the historian of economic thought usually pays little attention. However, since the primary source materials that continue to be the foundation for research in our academic discipline are here at stake, its institutional recognition and spread dep~<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): de Marco Alessandra<br>
Abstract: The present paper investigates Don DeLillo's 1972 End Zone, arguing that football is a metaphor for war and that DeLillo's analysis of football and its culture effectively constitutes a critique of the war mentality undergirding American society. In this novel DeLillo meditates on the historical process that historian Michael S. Sherry calls the "militarization" (xi) of the USA and that, since the 1930s, turned the country into a military and economic superpower allowing a war mentality to enter deep into the grain of American culture. The essay will read DeLillo's focus on language against Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok's psychoanalytical theories on demetaphorization as the linguistic counterpart of melancholia and against Herbert Marcuse's notion of functional language as a linguistic behavior that facilitates the annihilation of critical thinking. Both functional language and demetaphorization allow militarization to enforce its own discourse. Suffering from melancholia, the novel's protagonists fall prey to incorporation, a process whereby they disavow death as the product of war and, with it, pain, suffering, and destruction. As a result, the novel offers a cautionary tale about the consequences arising from an excessive exaltation of war as a means through which a nation seeks to affirm its "apotheosis" (End Zone 162).<br>

Abstract: Dans la réflexion de Jean-Pierre Vernant et Pierre Vidal-Naquet, le rapprochement entre le passé et le présent est caractéristique d'une démarche qui, pour aborder les problèmes historiques les plus difficiles, et notamment les questions politiques, n'hésite pas à recourir à ce que Nicole Loraux a pu appeler «une pratique contrôlée de l'anachronisme». L'analyse porte dans cette étude sur un point omniprésent dans leurs œuvres : l'héritage politique des Grecs ? Comment ont-ils défini, par leurs travaux, un héritage politique qui ne reprend pas tout ce que les Anciens ont pensé et fait? Comment, dans leur démarche, chacun à leur manière, ont-ils tracé et franchi des frontières, entre le passé et le présent? Quelle pertinence accorder dans ce contexte à la notion de frontière? Quel sens donner aux trois termes autour desquels est centrée cette contribution: le politique, les frontières, l'historien? In Jean-Pierre Vernant's and Pierre Vidal-Naquet's thought, the rapprochement between past and present characterizes a procedure which in dealing with the most difficult historical issues and notably the political ones, does not hesitate to resort to what Nicole Loraux once called "a controlled practice of anachronism". In this study the analysis bears on a pervasive point throughout their works: the political heritage of the Greeks? How did they define in their works a political heritage of the Greeks which does not take up all that the Ancients thought and did? How in their thought processes each of them in his own way has traced up and trespassed borders between past and present? What relevance can be accorded in such context to the notion of border? What meaning to be given to the three terms around which this contribution is centered: politics, the borders, the historian?<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflecting on these differences.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>

Author(s): DeLoughrey Elizabeth M.<br>
Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: Taking as its starting point classical themes developed since the Greeks, the present study aims to suggest that today a threshold may be crossed by means of philosophical reflection on music. Without disregarding the meaning of the concepts of imitation and expression (expressivo), the phenomenology of the inner consciousness of time may offer new possibilities, in parallel with structural analysis. Literary criticism and methodological consideration of the task of the historian have already exploited these possibilities. Why should music not do the same? Without claiming that phenomenological analyses can found a new musical aesthetic, they may be considered worthy of the attention of musicologists.<br>

Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The continent of Africa has been an important meaning for several cultures over at least three millennia; it is, however, only in the modern period that an Africana discourse became a practical and theoretical necessity. Mudimbe, as a part of his initial discussion of an African gnosis, poses this urgent question, “Would it then be possible to renew the notion of tradition from, let us say, a radical
         dispersionof African cultures?”
               Similar sentiment is echoed in the caution expressed by David L. Schoenbrun in an article devoted to the history of public health in East Africa. In this article he worries that the possibility for a distinctive novelty which might be forthcoming from these traditions is always in danger of becoming dominated by the discursive narrative of Protestantism or capitalism. He holds out the possibility of alternative narratives arising out of African history that would be in tension with the dominating Western discourses and would speak more directly to the traditions and rhythms of African temporalities.23
            
               Schoenbrun alludes to a comment made by his historian colleague Steve Feierman, one of the contributors to the24
            Africa and the Disciplinesvolume. Feierman's essay shows how African history contributes to the dissolution of the notion of a “world” or “universal” history so admired in the academy. In the midst of his discussion of historians and historiography in several parts of the globe, he has this to say about the American Civil Rights Movement: “The slaves and the barbarians were not coincidental to civilization, aberrant at the margins; they were constitutive of civilization, the way civilization defined itself. With the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, similar perceptions began to emerge.”
               Had Feierman been as attentive to African American history in the United States as he has been to East African history, he would have realized that African Ame~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Wixson Christopher<br>
Abstract: The resonance of Shaw's perspectives on health deepens in his later writings, from
      Back to Methuselah(1921) andThe Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism(1928) toDoctors' Delusions(1932) andFarfetched Fables(1948–50). In them, with an eye toward collective wellness, progressive growth, and enduring fitness, he promulgates interrelated theories of metabiology, socialism, despotism, and evolution. His constellation of superabundant vitality, political and metaphysical sensibilities, and practices of diet, exercise, and dress evokes a Victorian construction of healthiness, understood, according to historian Bruce Haley, as “a state of constitutional growth and development in which the bodily systems and mental faculties interoperate harmoniously under the direct motive power of vital energy or the indirect motive power of the moral will, or both. Its signs are, subjectively recognized, a sense of wholeness and unencumbered capability, and, externally recognized, the production of useful, creative labor.”
            For many at the time,18
         mens sana in corpore sanoconceptualized the healthy body as a vivarium for intellectual and moral growth while others were more radically materialist in positing happiness and good living as dependent upon the physiological self. In any case, as Haley maintains, the “practice of analogically or metaphorically connecting [spiritual health and bodily health] was habitual in Victorian epistemology[,] … the ideal of personal health a way of grasping the proper relation between the self as a whole … and the unity of moral and physical laws which transcend the self.”
            If consistent with their yoking of vivacity, integrity, and volition, Shaw flipped the hierarchy that privileged the corporeal, figuring the intellectual will as the unifying and driving force in health; in his words, “it is the mind that makes the body and not the body the mind.”19

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Before Utopia can be recuperated for architecture, the commonly referenced sources for the decline of utopian thought in architecture frequently rehearsed in the historiography of twentieth-century modern architecture and theory must be interrogated. In most stories, rejection of Utopia is explained causally as a consequence of what amounts to architectural hubris from the “18th century to the late 1960s.” Accordingly, by the 1960s the impossibility of deterministic architectural social science (misconstrued as Utopia) to ever deliver on its promises of improvement (the project of modern architecture) was revealed as not simply improbable but ultimately impossible—a diversion away from the supposedly
         realproblems of development. As architectural historian and theorist Anthony Vidler observes: “The crisis of utopia/utopian thinking [in architecture] was brought about by the architects' vision that utopia could be designed and planned.”
