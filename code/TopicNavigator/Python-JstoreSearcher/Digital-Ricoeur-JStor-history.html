  CHAPTER 3  Civic Education on Stage: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Rzegocka Jolanta<br>
  Abstract: The Jesuit order and its theater have played a vital part in the history of Europe and its cultural heritage.¹ Ever since the founding of the Society in 1540, the Jesuits have been active preachers, distinguished theologians and disputants, and have served as confessors and tutors to sovereigns and members of royal families across Christendom.² However, it is the order’s emphasis on education and the Jesuits’ role as teachers that put the activities of the Society at the heart of the present chapter. Jesuit colleges modeled after their prominent school, the Collegium Romanum (1551), offered a combination of high-quality teaching<br>

  CHAPTER 12  One Century of Science: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Leitão Henrique<br>
  Abstract: For historians of science, one of the most distinctive features of the Society of Jesus was its dedication to science and scientific education, especially when compared with other religious orders. The Jesuits’ contributions to early modern science have been studied extensively and are now widely known, lending further credence to George Sarton’s (1884–1956) dictum that “one cannot study the history of mathematics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries without coming across Jesuits at every corner.”¹ Fifty years later, in his book on the history of electricity in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, John Heilbron (1934–) echoed this assertion<br>

  Book Title: The Political Style of Conspiracy-Chase, Summer, and Lincoln<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pfau Michael William<br>
  Abstract: The turbulent history of the United States has provided a fertile ground for conspiracies, both real and imagined. From the American Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse-linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy-has been a staple of political rhetoric. Some conspiracy theories never catch on with the public, while others achieve widespread popularity. Whether successful or not, the means by which particular conspiracy theories spread is a rhetorical process, a process in which persuasive language, symbolism, and arguments act upon individual minds within concrete historical and political settings.Conspiracy rhetoric was a driving force in the evolution of antebellum political culture, contributing to the rise and fall of the great parties in the nineteenth century. One conspiracy theory in particular-the "slave power" conspiracy-was instrumental in facilitating the growth of the young Republican Party's membership and ideology.
      The Political Style of Conspiracyanalyzes the concept and reality of the "slave power" in the rhetorical discourse of the mid-nineteenth-century, in particular the speeches and writing of politicians Salmon P. Chase, Charles Sumner, and Abraham Lincoln. By examining their mainstream texts, Pfau reveals that, in addition to the "paranoid style" of conspiracy rhetoric that inhabits the margins of political life, Lincoln, Chase, and Sumner also engaged in a distinctive form of conspiracy rhetoric that is often found at the center of mainstream American society and politics.<br>

  Abstract: Conspiracy, the secret cooperation for the achievement of some base design, has been a frequently recurring topic of political discussions since ancient times. But it has been the turbulent history of the United States that has provided the most fertile ground for conspiracy discourse. From the time of the Revolution to the present day, conspiracy discourse—that is, linguistic and symbolic practices and artifacts revolving around themes, claims, or accusations of conspiracy—has pervaded diverse forums and genres of American political discourse. For many critics and commentators, the ubiquity of conspiracy theories in American history and the increasing appeal of<br>

  5  Lessons of the Slave Power Conspiracy: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt13x0p8c">The Political Style of Conspiracy</a><br>
  Abstract: It is unfortunate that at a juncture in history when conspiracy theories of various sorts increasingly populate the diverse locales of public spheres around the world, the study of conspiracy discourse continues to be hobbled, rather than enabled, by the legacy of the paranoid style. Too many scholars studying conspiracy still conceive of conspiracy discourse as uniformly deranged and dangerous. While a number of scholars have attempted to move beyond the oversimplifications and pejorative assumptions of the paranoid style in their engagements with mainstream conspiracy texts, few have brought to the issue Hofstadterʹs critical sensitivity and concern with discursive form.¹<br>

  Chapter Two  The Fundamentals of Revival from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Revival speech is the foundation of Fundamentalist politics. At the heart of Fundamentalist efforts to remake the public—from abolition and temperance to contemporary struggles against abortion and environmentalism—is a desire to make a world in which the gospel message can be propagated and in which people will be more receptive to revivalist persuasion. For much of Christian history it was assumed that this transformation could only come “in the fullness of time,” which had been preordained by God, but Fundamentalist counterpublicity derives from an emerging belief in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that human actions could affect God’s<br>

  Book Title: Mourning Animals-Rituals and Practices Surrounding Animal Death<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kalof Linda<br>
  Abstract: We live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. The change in the way we cohabitate with animals can be seen in the way we treat them when they die. There is an almost infinite variety of ways to help us cope with the loss of our nonhuman friends-from burial, cremation, and taxidermy; to wearing or displaying the remains (ashes, fur, or other parts) of our deceased animals in jewelry, tattoos, or other artwork; to counselors who specialize in helping people mourn pets; to classes for veterinarians; to tips to help the surviving animals who are grieving their animal friends; to pet psychics and memorial websites. But the reality is that these practices, and related beliefs about animal souls or animal afterlife, generally only extend, with very few exceptions, to certain kinds of animals-pets. Most animals, in most cultures, are not mourned, and the question of an animal afterlife is not contemplated at all.
      Mourning Animalsinvestigates how we mourn animal deaths, which animals are grievable, and what the implications are for all animals.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Abstract: People today, especially in the industrialized and postindustrialized world, live more intimately with nonhuman animals than ever before in history. We share our lives with companion animals in a way that just fifty years ago would have been unheard of. One way to measure this drastic change in our relationships with other animals is to look at the growth of the animal death care industry. According to Brandes, there are over six hundred pet cemeteries in the United States alone, while according to Ambros there are over 900 in Japan.¹ There is even a small but growing movement to allow<br>

  All the World and a Little Bit More: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) PRĘGOWSKI MICHAŁ PIOTR<br>
  Abstract: Burying companion animals had been practiced by humans as early as 16,500 years BP, as recent archeological findings from the Epipaleolithic cemetery of Uyun al-Hammam suggest.¹ During the Early Neolithic (ca. 8000 BP) the burials of dogs who accompanied hunter-gatherers were already common.² Despite having a significant history, mortuary practices related to companion animals gained social significance not so long ago—in the nineteenth century, following industrialization, urbanization, as well as the rise of the middle class. At that time, purebred dogs ceased to dwell mostly in upper-class estates and became a fixture in the confined spaces of European and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) COLVIN CHRISTINA M.<br>
  Abstract: Two forms of taxidermy predominate in the popular imagination: the type specimen in the natural history museum and the severed-head–style hunting trophy. In the case of the museum specimen, taxidermic animals stand in for their species; single animals serve as representatives of whole populations. In the tradition of the “Father of Modern Taxidermy” Carl Akeley, the aesthetic of the museum specimen minimizes differences between individuals (such as bullet wounds and other surface blemishes) to maximize an animal’s emblematic power; according to Donna Haraway, such taxidermy makes “nature true to type.”¹ In the case of hunting trophies, taxidermic animals represent<br>

  Author(s) KISIEL EMMA<br>
  Abstract: The question of whether or not humans mourn animals is present in all of my photographic work. This theme emerged in my art when I began looking closely at dead animals and making images of roadkill animals, photographing flower and stone memorials I built around their bodies. My recent project, “Another Death,” portrays museum taxidermic animals that have suffered another kind of death after their initial demise. Frozen in time, they are presented either in the throes of death at another creature’s hand or in a limp resting pose, having just passed. Moments like these appear frequently in natural history<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  The Habitation of Rhetoric from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: The problem I want to engage is both fundamental and ancient. When Cicero wrote his
                     De inventione, it already had had a long history. Yet his comments on that history still retain a lively theoretical interest for students of rhetoric and argumentation. Consequently, they can serve as an appropriate text for introducing and locating the issues addressed in this paper.<br>

  Abstract: At the moment of his fatal heart attack last November, Jerry Mohrmann was engaged in his normal academic business. He was writing rhetorical criticism. More specifically, he was completing a close analysis of a short but important speech text—John Calhoun’s oration “On the Reception of the Abolition Petitions.” This study had a specific and seemingly narrow focus, but it arose from a number of complex, general issues and incorporated many of Jerry’s characteristic interests. Thus, to recall the history of this project allows us to learn much not only about the man but also about the vocation he pursued.<br>

  Abstract: In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson declared Flag Day an official nationwide day of celebration. As United States involvement in the First World War loomed, the holiday became a spectacular affair showcasing American history, the dedication of the citizenry, and the nation’s preparedness for international conflict. The event was concurrently deemed Preparedness Day, a moniker emphasizing home-front readiness. Over 150 cities took up Wilson’s call, organizing parades, pageants, and other commemorations. The revelry followed the Lincoln Highway (a route that spanned from New York to San Francisco, somewhat following today’s I-80). Towns on this course arranged festivities, including lectures on American<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Public Culture and the Americanization of Immigrants from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1tqx76n">To Become an American</a><br>
  Abstract: At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States faced one of the most dramatic transformations to its national identity. From the 1890s to the 1920s, nearly 23 million immigrants, largely from Europe, would constitute what Mirel deems “one of the largest migrations in human history.”¹ While the United States had long been a nation of immigrants, the vast numbers of arrivals from Southern and Eastern Europe presented a significant shift from previous generations. For some, this momentous change was cause for disapprobation. Leonard Dinnerstein and David Reimers explain that, often fleeing “horrendous conditions” of poverty, immigrants came with<br>

  Author(s) Astell Ann<br>
  Abstract: Simone Weil’s
                  The Need for Roots (L’Enracinement), written during the last months of her life (1909–43) and with her dying strength, is a fitting companion piece toBattling to the End (Achever Clausewitz), the last book by René Girard (b. 1923). Compatriots, Weil and Girard each retell the long story of French history from the Middle Ages, beginning in medias res and dwelling upon many of the same modern turning points—1789, 1815, 1914, 1940. Girard explicitly links his own childhood memories of the war years with the Free French radio broadcasts from London and the names of Maurice<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we considered the possibility of a non-sacrificial knowledge and, even if with many caveats, we resolved that question in the affirmative. There is still one dimension of Girard’s mimetic theory, however, that in our journey through the history of the relationship between philosophy and religion we have not yet adequately examined: the “apocalyptic” dimension.<br>

  Abstract: The slightly more than five-year period from Menachem Begin’s election as prime minister of Israel in 1977 through the war in Lebanon represents one of the most crucial periods in symbolic development in the history of Israel. This period was dominated by conflicting aspects of the Revisionist symbol system. On the one hand, Begin led Israel first to the Camp David Accords and then to a peace treaty with Egypt. In the development of the peace process, Begin’s rhetoric reflected the underlying myth of Holocaust and Redemption, including a strong commitment to maintaining Israeli control over Eretz Israel, but also<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt6fv">Christianity and the Mass Media in America</a><br>
  Abstract: I address in this book the relationship between the mass media and Christian ʺtribesʺ in America. At its core this relationship is a dynamic tension between civil generality, on the one hand, and a sectarian particularity, on the other. The Christian metanarrative of transcendence assumes a theistic perspective where God acts in real human history; this God-oriented view of human affairs is never fully in accord with the mainstream mediaʹs own subnarratives of immanence, which morally assume that human action is the beginning and end of history. Nevertheless, religious groups and the media borrow each otherʹs rhetoric both to embrace<br>

  Book Title: Executing Democracy-Volume One: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hartnett Stephen John<br>
  Abstract: Executing Democracy: Capital Punishment & the Making of America, 1683-1807is the first volume of a rhetorical history of public debates about crime, violence, and capital punishment in America. This examination begins in 1683, when William Penn first struggled to govern the rowdy indentured servants of Philadelphia, and continues up until 1807, when the Federalists sought to impose law-and-order upon the New Republic.This volume offers a lively historical overview of how crime, violence, and capital punishment influenced the settling of the New World, the American Revolution, and the frantic post-war political scrambling to establish norms that would govern the new republic.By presenting a macro-historical overview, and by filling the arguments with voices from different political camps and communicative genres, Hartnett provides readers with fresh perspectives for understanding the centrality of public debates about capital punishment to the history of American democracy.<br>

  Book Title: The Red Sea-In Search of Lost Space<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wick Alexis<br>
  Abstract: The Red Sea has, from time immemorial, been one of the world's most navigated spaces, in the pursuit of trade, pilgrimage and conquest. Yet this multidimensional history remains largely unrevealed by its successive protagonists. Intrigued by the absence of a holistic portrayal of this body of water and inspired by Fernand Braudel's famous work on the Mediterranean, this book brings alive a dynamic Red Sea world across time, revealing the particular features of a unique historical actor. In capturing this heretofore lost space, it also presents a critical, conceptual history of the sea, leading the reader into the heart of Eurocentrism. The Sea, it is shown, is a vital element of the modern philosophy of history.Alexis Wick is not satisfied with this inclusion of the Red Sea into history and attendant critique of Eurocentrism. Contrapuntally, he explores how the world and the sea were imagined differently before imperial European hegemony. Searching for the lost space of Ottoman visions of the sea,
      The Red Seamakes a deeper argument about the discipline of history and the historian's craft.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt19633g6">The Red Sea</a><br>
  Abstract: IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROACH that sees space, not as the foundational objective setting for the unraveling of time, but rather as a multitude of discursively constituted and lived places and landscapes, each with a poetics, a history, and a sense of its own, this chapter affirms the potentiality of alternative geohistorical compositions, governed by a different grammar than that of objective space and time.¹ If the Red Sea was invented only in the early nineteenth century as a scientific object, and if Ottoman public discourse did not frame the area in terms of that category before the 1850s, then<br>

  Abstract: AT THE HEART OF THIS book is a basic question that has heretofore largely eluded serious attention: How does history make its subject? Clearly, not all subjects are deemed historical at all times—that much has been clear from the beginnings of the discipline. What is required, then, for a particular object to become a proper subject of history? And what are the implications of such constraints for the history that is being written? In other words, what this book explores is the

  Author(s) VICO GIAMBATTISTA<br>
  Abstract: The ʺPrinciples of New Science of Giambattista Vico concerning the Common Nature of the Nationsʺ (first edition:1725) is a model work (comparative, evolutionary) for later history and anthropology: a view of the history of all societies as the account of their birth and development. But itʹs also a virtual speculative ethnopoetics in which the poetry of the ʺNationsʺ (= gentiles/gentes = Gk. ethnoi) already looms large. The core of the work, an extended section called ʺPoetic Wisdom,ʺ sets out a kind o f aboriginal creativity-writ-large that comes back full circle into the projected ʺnew science.ʺ Of that interplay between the<br>

  Abstract: As does his very different contemporary Goethe, Blake appears today as one of the first of the new poets to revive in his own work a more-than-literary role as (ʺvisionaryʺ) shaper-of-the-real. (See Vico, above, p. 4.) Of the prevalence of such a mythopoetic mode in a larger human history, he wrote: ʺThe antiquities of every Nation under Heaven, is no less sacred than that of the Jews. They are the same thing as Jacob Bryant, and all antiquaries have proved. How other antiquities came to be neglected and disbelieved, while those of the jews are collected and arranged, is an<br>

  Author(s) ELIADE MIRCEA<br>
  Abstract: An experimental novelist earlier along (his objective, in the Rumanian phrase, to ʺsabotage historyʺ), Eliade became a historian of religion and the greatest living reinterpreter of the sacred dimensions of religion and thought, setting these against a contemporary ʺdesacralization of natureʺ through an impressive sweep of disciplines and cultures (shamanism, yoga, alchemy, etc.). His large work on shamanism is still the best guide to the subject, reinforcing an intuition long held of the shaman as artist and thinker as well as ʺmedicine man, priest and psychopompus.ʺ In the present co-editorʹs book, Technicians of the Sacred (the title itself is a<br>

  Abstract: ʺ[Among] the oldest pure performers in the history of settled human life,ʺ notes Alfonso Ortiz (1977 ms: 4–5), the sacred clowns in their Pueblo form ʺwere around at least by the end of the 1st millennium, a.d., because petroglyphs and other representations of them are traceable to that period.ʺ As E. T. Kirby indicates (above, p. 266), the clownʹs ʺsacredness,ʺ like the shamanʹs, hooks into an extraordinary initiatory/visionary experience and rebirth. Ortiz terms this rebirth ʺa new, omnipotent mode of existenceʺ (1977 ms: 22)—what Mircea Eliade speaks of as the ʺdivine election,ʺ and Black Elk, with specific reference<br>

  Book Title: i never knew what time it was-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): antin david<br>
  Abstract: In this series of intricately related texts, internationally known poet, critic, and performance artist David Antin explores the experience of time—how it's felt, remembered, and recounted. These free-form talk pieces—sometimes called talk poems or simply talks—began as improvisations at museums, universities, and poetry centers where Antin was invited to come and think out loud. Serious and playful, they move rapidly from keen analysis to powerful storytelling to passages of pure comedy, as they range kaleidoscopically across Antin's experiences: in the New York City of his childhood and youth, the Eastern Europe of family and friends, and the New York and Southern California of his art and literary career.

  Abstract: Time, like other facets of phenomenal experience, has played a critical role in the history of world religions.¹ In Judaism specifically, numerous opinions, spanning many centuries, geographical localities, intellectual influences, and literary genres, have been expressed about time. Accordingly, I make no attempt here to provide a comprehensive overview of the understanding of time in the variegated history of Judaism.² I do take the liberty, however, of making two observations, the generality of which will foster rather than eschew specific historical analyses. First, it is not viable to depict temporality in opposition to or separate from spatiality in Judaism, let<br>

  CANTO XIX  Vectors of Human Love from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn7mj">Lectura Dantis</a><br>
  Author(s) STURM-MADDOX SARA<br>
  Abstract: Canto XIX of the
                  Purgatoriohas not been among the most favored in terms of its readers’ attention. A survey of its critical history reveals, moreover, that readers have been attracted largely by one element, that of the dream of the siren with which the canto begins. The account of the pilgrim’s dream, however, occupies only nine tercets, or twenty-seven verses out of a total of 145. Even if we include in the episode the two introductory tercets that afford a temporal orientation, as well as the dreamer’s awakening to Virgil’s call and the latter’s explanation of the dream experience,<br>

  Author(s) ARMOUR PETER<br>
  Abstract: To the modern reader this canto might seem at first to be of a somewhat remote and antiquarian interest with, at best, a certain formal and old-fashioned poetic beauty. Coming immediately after the richly textured account of humankind’s lost paradise on earth and of the beautiful lady who explains it to Dante, Canto XXIX introduces a series of symbols from which the reader is required to deduce a corresponding series of “other meanings.” It would appear, therefore, to belong to that outmoded form, the allegory, and indeed virtually all commentators agree that it is an allegorical presentation of the history<br>

  Abstract: Canto XXXII depends heavily on the effect of its incipit, an opening verse that almost seamlessly links this canto to the preceding one in which Beatrice makes her dramatic appearance, on a much more profound level, to the experience of world and Church history in Dante’s own keenly developed sense of political and moral poetics.<br>

  Introduction: from:

  Abstract: A concern with time is intrinsic to the internal logic of modernity. “More than anything else,” Zygmunt Bauman writes, modernity is the “history of time: the time when time has history” (“Time and Space Reunited,” 172). Radically breaking with the authority and legitimacy of the past, modernity offers a totalizing vision of progress toward an illimitable future.¹ Its universal narrative of irrepressible global development presupposes a uniform scale of spatial and temporal measurement. In this context the legislative creation of world standard time at the International Prime Meridian Conference of 1884 stands as a signal moment in the history of<br>

  Abstract: What is the value of resuscitating a temporal politics of modernism, as this book has attempted to do? If, as I have suggested, modernism represented a crucial stage in the history of the suppression of temporal politics because it alternately engaged in that suppression and resisted it, what can we learn from modernism about the political constitution of time in the age of GPS and instantaneity? My argument has been that we can draw from modernist temporality a model for a politicized time that is neither subsumed under global standard time’s uniformity nor retracted into a psychical, fluid interiority.

  Abstract: For the past twenty years, musicology has increasingly merged the study of Western “classical” music with cultural history on one hand and critical-philosophical thought on the other. This development is no longer news, but it is still noteworthy. The field has expanded to take in a wide variety of topics and methods formerly considered peripheral or illegitimate. It has rescinded the exemption from social utility formerly used to separate classical music from popular music and culture, and it has broken both with the nineteenth-century metaphysics of music as a vessel of transcendence and the twentieth century’s reduction of that metaphysics<br>

  Abstract: Talk about musical influence has traditionally been cheap. The young Beethoven was influenced by Haydn and Mozart but cut loose, became himself, and influenced everyone else thereafter. Shostakovich’s symphonies were influenced by Mahler and his string quartets by Beethoven, but the voice in all of them is distinctively his own. And so on: a short history of music could be written by compiling such clichés, which bestrew the musical public domain. But influence can still cost money.<br>

This change epitomizes much of the recent history of musicology. It reorients musical understanding.

  Abstract: Subjectivity is a ″vanishing subject,″ writes Amélie Oksenberg Rorty in this book′s opening chapter. As she traces the history of some of the philosophical insights that have shaped current understandings of subjectivity and the subject, Rorty finds not a progression but various contested movements and fragmentary meanings. Self-awareness has a different philosophical trajectory than individuated perception does; scholars have emphasized a diachronically unified persona and, at times, posed it against a synchronically unified persona; the meanings of emotions, the body, social interactions, and suffering as subjectivity have all been areas of contestation. For example, according to Rorty, ″Where Aristotle finds<br>

  Abstract: It is obvious that we cannot analyze the history of vernacularization—the term used here for the literary and political promotion of local language—or even observe it taking place, without knowing precisely what it is we are trying to observe and analyze. If we are concerned with the transition from quasi-universal to more regional ways of being in the spheres of culture and power, we will pay attention to, among other things, the ways people began to produce texts that were local rather than translocal in body and spirit—in their language and spheres of circulation as well as<br>

We can chart the shifts in cosmopolitan and vernacular cultural production without interruption from about the fifth century on, based on texts that are for the most part securely datable—an almost unparalleled antiquity and chronological transparency.

  Abstract: To an outside observer, the vernacularization of Europe as a literary-cultural process in itself and, even more so, in relation to political processes appears to be one of the great understudied topics of Western history. The editor of a recent edition of the
                  Oxford History of Medieval Europe, while observing that a major factor in “the new diversity” that marked the late Middle Ages was “the exploitation of a variety of languages in important writings,” confesses himself at a loss to explain the development itself; the origins of the vernacular turn are for him as “mysterious” as its results are<br>

The great innovation that was to enduringly change these two worlds occurred during the first five centuries of the second millennium, and it shows a remarkably consistent morphology.

  Abstract: One particular mode of theorizing and explaining culture implicitly rejects, or is entirely indifferent to, both culture’s evolutionary development and its purely instrumental contribution to power. Instead, culture is viewed as something just there, and as ever self-identical. It is considered outside the flux of time, whether natural or political, or else endowed with so deep a history as to appear forever beyond time. And its stance in relationship to power is presumed to be almost one of consanguinity, certainly not that of an object to be deployed at the will of power.<br>

Most of the doctrines of rebirth discussed earlier have both historical and contemporary relevance, but for Greece one has no choice but to deal exclusively with the historical traditions, beginning with the figure most associated with rebirth doctrines, Pythagoras.

  Book Title: After the Massacre-Commemoration and Consolation in Ha My and My Lai<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Faust Drew<br>
  Abstract: Though a generation has passed since the massacre of civilians at My Lai, the legacy of this tragedy continues to reverberate throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world. This engrossing study considers how Vietnamese villagers in My Lai and Ha My-a village where South Korean troops committed an equally appalling, though less well-known, massacre of unarmed civilians-assimilate the catastrophe of these mass deaths into their everyday ritual life. Based on a detailed study of local history and moral practices,
      After the Massacrefocuses on the particular context of domestic life in which the Vietnamese villagers interact with their ancestors on one hand and the ghosts of tragic death on the other. Heonik Kwon explains what intimate ritual actions can tell us about the history of mass violence and the global bipolar politics that caused it. He highlights the aesthetics of Vietnamese commemorative rituals and the morality of their practical actions to liberate the spirits from their grievous history of death. The author brings these important practices into a critical dialogue with dominant sociological theories of death and symbolic transformation.<br>

  Abstract: To whom do the dead belong? And how must they be claimed? War produces unnatural death, deaths that occur out of place—away from home and kin—and deaths that occur out of time, to the young and strong. Modern war kills more noncombatants than soldiers; death strikes outside the rules meant to contain and rationalize the violence of war. The nations that are war’s agents claim the dead for political purposes and ideologies, wrenching them away from family and leaving deep wounds, turning them into instruments rather than agents of history. Religious tradition is subordinated or expropriated by state<br>

  Abstract: If we consider the history of the Cold War “from above” and reduce it to the doctrine of deterrence, of imagining war in order to prevent war—which has been a dominant paradigm in international history—it appears that political history and the morality of death have no meaningful relationship.

  Abstract: Physical anthropologist Ashley Montagu (1905–99) started his 1942 study on race by calling his subject one of the greatest and most tragic errors of his time.¹ As a scientist, Montagu felt the need to disprove scientifically what he considered “man’s most dangerous myth.” By 1942 the dangers of racial theories had become obvious in Nazi Germany, where racial dogmas were exploited to justify genocide. After World War II racial thinking became taboo in Europe. Replaced by “ethnicity” or banned altogether, the word

  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: The title of this collection is derived from Friedrich Nietzsche’s essay “On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life.”¹ The central argument of this passionate work, judiciously qualified, reflects my own deepest convictions about the value of historical scholarship. Nietzsche opened his essay with a quotation from Goethe: “I hate everything that merely instructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my activity.” This meant to him that a vital historiography must serve the “life and action” of society. There is, Nietzsche argued, a “natural relationship of an age, a culture, a nation with its history—evoked by hunger, regulated<br>

  Abstract: Although European historians have increasingly recognized the impact of large-scale change or significant events on human culture, they have paid little attention to the importance of the less dramatic aspects of social experience for shaping the attitudes of men. The result has been, for most of us, a schism between social and intellectual history that has impoverished both. As Frederic C.

  Abstract: One of the most extraordinary and yet obscure currents in the intellectual history of the Renaissance was the interest of Christian thinkers in the Jewish cabala. This concern extended from Pico’s attempt to absorb cabala into a Christian synthesis of universal knowledge at the end of the fifteenth century well into the seventeenth, and included writers and scholars from every major European country.

  Abstract: Renaissance Florence has long been considered the origin in European history of a concern with politics as an autonomous study. Faced with the problems of governing a turbulent but independent republic, anxious to insure her survival in a precarious world that seemed to be ruled only by power, and nourished by the rediscovered political culture of antiquity, thoughtful Florentines, in a process that reached a climax with Machiavclli and Guicciardini, began to articulate realistic principles of political effectiveness and to define its limits.

Historiography has now become so various and eclectic that it is often difficult to see it as the expression of any specific discipline; historians today seem to be united only by some common concern with the past and by a common allegiance, at least in principle, to respect for evidence, the exercise of critical intelligence, and openness of mind.

This event is the collapse of the traditional dramatic organization of Western history.

But the lessons of history are rarely unambiguous. For one thing, its messages are various. Like Scripture, it can generally be made to support what we want it to support; and in the case of education, the Western cultural tradition incorporates not just one but a whole scries of educational ideals, which rest on quite different assumptions and point in different directions.

  Book Title: Gadamer’s Repercussions-Reconsidering Philosophical Hermeneutics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Krajewski Bruce<br>
  Abstract: Certainly one of the key German philosophers of the twentieth century, Hans-Georg Gadamer also influenced the study of literature, art, music, sacred and legal texts, and medicine. Indeed, while much attention has been focused on Gadamer's writings about ancient Greek and modern German philosophy, the relevance of his work for other disciplines is only now beginning to be properly considered and understood. In an effort to address this slant, this volume brings together many prominent scholars to assess, re-evaluate, and question Hans-Georg Gadamer's works, as well as his place in intellectual history. The book includes a recent essay by Gadamer on "the task of hermeneutics," as well as essays by distinguished contributors including Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, Gerald Bruns, Georgia Warnke, and many others. The contributors situate Gadamer's views in surprising ways and show that his writings speak to a range of contemporary debates—from constitutional questions to issues of modern art. A controversial final section attempts to uncover and clarify Gadamer's history in relation to National Socialism. More an investigation and questioning than a celebration of this venerable and profoundly influential philosopher, this collection will become a catalyst for any future rethinking of philosophical hermeneutics, as well as a significant starting place for rereading and reviewing Hans-Georg Gadamer.<br>

  Book Title: A Problem of Presence-Beyond Scripture in an African Church<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Engelke Matthew<br>
  Abstract: The Friday Masowe apostolics of Zimbabwe refer to themselves as “the Christians who don’t read the Bible.” They claim they do not need the Bible because they receive the Word of God “live and direct” from the Holy Spirit. In this insightful and sensitive historical ethnography, Matthew Engelke documents how this rejection of scripture speaks to longstanding concerns within Christianity over mediation and authority. The Bible, of course, has been a key medium through which Christians have recognized God’s presence. But the apostolics perceive scripture as an unnecessary, even dangerous, mediator. For them, the materiality of the Bible marks a distance from the divine and prohibits the realization of a live and direct faith. Situating the Masowe case within a broad comparative framework, Engelke shows how their rejection of textual authority poses a problem of presence—which is to say, how the religious subject defines, and claims to construct, a relationship with the spiritual world through the semiotic potentials of language, actions, and objects. Written in a lively and accessible style, A Problem of Presence makes important contributions to the anthropology of Christianity, the history of religions in Africa, semiotics, and material culture studies.<br>

  THREE  The Question of Leadership: from:

  Abstract: “I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT Johane Masowe looked like,” said Madzimai Tsitsi. Lazarus and I had been interviewing Tsitsi and her husband, Madzibaba Zechariah, for about an hour when she hit on this point. We had been asking the couple about the church’s history, something we routinely did in our interviews and conversations.
                  Church historyis a term the apostolics often use. Not every apostolic claims to know much about it, but most profess an interest in it. Congregants learn about church history from the people who have been around—the “old-timers” in a congregation, as they call them. Old-timers<br>

  Book Title: Imaginary Communities-Utopia, the Nation, and the Spatial Histories of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Wegner Phillip E.<br>
  Abstract: Drawing from literary history, social theory, and political critique, this far-reaching study explores the utopian narrative as a medium for understanding the social space of the modern nation-state. Considering the narrative utopia from its earliest manifestation in Thomas More's sixteenth-century work
      Utopiato some of the most influential utopias of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this book is an astute study of a literary genre as well as a nuanced dialectical meditation on the history of utopian thinking as a quintessential history of modernity. As he unravels the dialectics at work in the utopian narrative, Wegner gives an ambitious synthetic discussion of theories of modernity, considering and evaluating the ideas of writers such as Ernst Bloch, Louis Marin, Gilles Deleuze, Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Henri Lefebvre, Paul de Man, Karl Mannheim, Mikhail Bakhtin, Jürgen Habermas, Slavoj Zizek, and Homi Bhabha.<br>

  Abstract: In 2004, Raʾūf ʿAbbās, one of Egypt’s leading historians, published his autobiography. This memoir, ostensibly a pedestrian intellectual autobiography of a retired history professor, proved instead to be a frontal assault on Egypt’s entire historiographical establishment. The author spared no one: neither the stars of Egypt’s academic elite nor the lowliest graduate student escaped the lashing of his pen. Over the course of 336 crowded pages, he accused his colleagues of poor academic standards, plagiarism, intellectual shallowness, ethical violations, political partisanship, and collaboration with the state’s security services.

  Abstract: By 1920, modern historical thought had reached a certain point of maturity. My aim in this chapter is to explain this process. With improved accessibility to new types of knowledge and completely new forms of intellectual organization, the perceptual tools of educated people were modified, at first quite slowly, but by 1919, quite decisively. Though it is yet too early to speak of a genre of modern history, the development of new linguistic resources, in fact an entire semantic field, was the crucial and final element that brought the historicization process to a mature point.

  Abstract: This chapter is about historiographical competition. What began with the modern conceptual innovation of the founder paradigm, continued with the development of compatible linguistic and conceptual resources and, supported by powerful scholarly institutions such as the ʿĀbdīn archive, culminated with the advent of modern historical narration. Driven by the post-1919 sociocultural and political changes, the most important of which was the rise of a new middle class, a qualitative and quantitative change in the arena of history writing occurred in the next two decades.

  Abstract: I shall leave the Greeks of Homer for the moment and begin this chapter with an aside on African cannibalism by T. H. Huxley in his popular book,
                  Man’s Place in Nature.² Stephen Jay Gould refers to Huxley as “a fierce defender of evolution and the greatest prose stylist in the history of British science,” and, I might add, a man given to an unrelenting rationality, an opponent of Christian theology and the inventor of that wonderful term “agnosticism.”³ Yet, serendipitously, I found an interesting section, entitled “African Cannibalism in the Sixteenth Century,” wedged between the first and second chapters<br>

  III  Plotinian Neoplatonism from:

  Abstract: Though the history of Neoplatonism starts, properly speaking, with Plotinus (205–70),¹ what we have called the Neoplatonic reading of Homer had its sources in habits of thought developed long before the third century and found full expression not in Plotinus himself but in Porphyry and then in the later Neoplatonists. Plotinus never mentions the name of Homer² and is very little concerned with interpretation of texts and myths from the poets. In the relatively sparse echoes of Homer and other poetry in the

  Abstract: What has been elaborated here is the history of perhaps the most powerful and enduring of the “strong misreadings” (to use Harold Bloom’s term) that make up our cultural heritage. I have avoided any attempt to hold that reading of Homer up against others, to affirm or to deny it, beyond occasional observations on analogies between these ancient interpretive critics and those of our own time. My reticence on this score reveals an implicit model of reading with similarities to Bloom’s, and no doubt in part derivative from it. Beyond his definition of the poles of interpretation as strong and<br>

  Book Title: Reconfiguring Modernity-Concepts of Nature in Japanese Political Ideology<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Thomas Julia Adeney<br>
  Abstract: Julia Adeney Thomas turns the concept of nature into a powerful analytical lens through which to view Japanese modernity, bringing the study of both Japanese history and political modernity to a new level of clarity. She shows that nature necessarily functions as a political concept and that changing ideas of nature's political authority were central during Japan's transformation from a semifeudal world to an industrializing colonial empire. In political documents from the nineteenth to the early twentieth century, nature was redefined, moving from the universal, spatial concept of the Tokugawa period, through temporal, social Darwinian ideas of inevitable progress and competitive struggle, to a celebration of Japan as a nation uniquely in harmony with nature. The so-called traditional "Japanese love of nature" masks modern state power. Thomas's theoretically sophisticated study rejects the supposition that modernity is the ideological antithesis of nature, overcoming the determinism of the physical environment through technology and liberating denatured subjects from the chains of biology and tradition. In making "nature" available as a critical term for political analysis, this book yields new insights into prewar Japan's failure to achieve liberal democracy, as well as an alternative means of understanding modernity and the position of non-Western nations within it.<br>

  Abstract: In the first chapter, I posed two possible relationships between nature and modernity: one antithetical, the other cosmopological. It is now time to review these models and to ask how foregrounding the concept of nature has provided an alternative perspective on Japan’s place in what Maruyama, Weber, and so many others recognized as the problematic universal history of modernity.¹<br>

  Book Title: Studying Global Pentecostalism-Theories and Methods<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): van der Laan Cornelis<br>
  Abstract: With its remarkable ability to adapt to many different cultures, Pentecostalism has become the world’s fastest growing religious movement. More than five hundred million adherents worldwide have reshaped Christianity itself. Yet some fundamental questions in the study of global Pentecostalism, and even in what we call “Pentecostalism,” remain largely unaddressed. Bringing together leading scholars in the social sciences, history, and theology, this unique volume explores these questions for this rapidly growing, multidisciplinary field of study. A valuable resource for anyone studying new forms of Christianity, it offers insights and guidance on both theoretical and methodological issues. The first section of the book examines such topics as definitions, essentialism, postcolonialism, gender, conversion, and globalization. The second section features contributions from those working in psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. The third section traces the boundaries of theology from the perspectives of pneumatology, ecumenical studies, inter-religious relations, and empirical theology.<br>

  Book Title: Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Morgan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

  Abstract: In the Baha’i tradition, nonviolence is not a principle derived primarily through exegesis but one given through revelation, to use the Baha’i technical term for its primary scripture. There can be no dispute or discussion on this point by either a follower of the Baha’i faith or those who study and understand this relatively recent religion. What may be a source of discussion is the question of how in the context of the history of religion and religions and especially the history of the Baha’i faith this came to be.

  Book Title: Rifle Reports-A Story of Indonesian Independence<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Steedly Mary Margaret<br>
  Abstract: On August 17, 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from Dutch colonial rule. Five years later, the Republic of Indonesia was recognized as a unified, sovereign state. The period in between was a time of aspiration, mobilization, and violence, in which nationalists fought to expel the Dutch while also trying to come to grips with the meaning of "independence."
      Rifle Reportsis an ethnographic history of this extraordinary time as it was experienced on the outskirts of the nation among Karo Batak villagers in the rural highlands of North Sumatra. Based on extensive interviews and conversations with Karo veterans,Rifle Reportsinterweaves personal and family memories, songs and stories, memoirs and local histories, photographs and monuments, to trace the variously tangled and perhaps incompletely understood ways that Karo women and men contributed to the founding of the Indonesian nation. The routes they followed are divergent, difficult, sometimes wavering, and rarely obvious, but they are clearly marked with the signs of gender. This innovative historical study of nationalism and decolonization is an anthropological exploration of the gendering of wartime experience, as well as an inquiry into the work of storytelling as memory practice and ethnographic genre.<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Place-A Philosophical History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Casey Edward S.<br>
  Abstract: In this imaginative and comprehensive study, Edward Casey, one of the most incisive interpreters of the Continental philosophical tradition, offers a philosophical history of the evolving conceptualizations of place and space in Western thought. Not merely a presentation of the ideas of other philosophers,
      The Fate of Placeis acutely sensitive to silences, absences, and missed opportunities in the complex history of philosophical approaches to space and place. A central theme is the increasing neglect of place in favor of space from the seventh century A.D. onward, amounting to the virtual exclusion of place by the end of the eighteenth century. Casey begins with mythological and religious creation stories and the theories of Plato and Aristotle and then explores the heritage of Neoplatonic, medieval, and Renaissance speculations about space. He presents an impressive history of the birth of modern spatial conceptions in the writings of Newton, Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant and delineates the evolution of twentieth-century phenomenological approaches in the work of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, and Heidegger. In the book's final section, Casey explores the postmodern theories of Foucault, Derrida, Tschumi, Deleuze and Guattari, and Irigaray.<br>

  Abstract: To turn to the seventeenth century is to plunge into a turbulent world in which alchemy vied with physics, theology with philosophy, politics with religion, nations with each other, individuals with their anguished souls. No single treatment can do justice to this multifarious period of human history. We can, however, pick our way through it by attending to an assortment of figures who occupied themselves expressly with questions of place and space: Gassendi, Newton, Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz.

  Abstract: In the midst of the intra-Christian controversies in fourth-century Antioch, Christians undertook to acquire and redefine not only other Christians’ places, but also places associated with Greek and Roman gods and with Judaism. The emperor Julian’s interest in rebuilding the Jerusalem Temple inflamed Christian anti-Jewish rhetoric around the empire,¹ and his support of places and practices associated with the gods further complicated Christians’ relations with their neighbors in Antioch.² These latter tensions increased during the conflict involving Daphne’s famous oracular temple of Apollo.

  Abstract: Perceptions of places are socially constructed and profoundly influential, shaping understandings of the past and thus also expectations for the future. Fourth-century Antioch is a particularly rich site of spatial construction and change, in part because of its complex history during late antiquity, when religious and political upheavals altered the cityscape, in part because of its prominence within empirewide conversations, and in part because so much textual evidence regarding Antioch survives. Thanks to Libanius, John Chrysostom, and Theodoret, it is possible to investigate these decades of Antioch’s history in much more depth and from more perspectives than is usually possible<br>

  Abstract: With this third volume of our three-part project on the history of the humanities we have arrived at the modern age. This is the period of discipline formation and academic institutionalization, but it is also the period when the humanities and sciences drew farther apart. While already foreshadowed by Giambattista Vico’s famous eighteenth-century distinction between the ‘science of the human’ and ‘science of the natural’, Wilhelm Dilthey’s distinction between
                  GeisteswissenschaftandNaturwissenschaftwas very influential.¹ That is, the humanities are deemed to be predicated on understanding (Verstehen), the sciences on explaining (Erklären). The distinction was adopted by philosophers such as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Cohen H. Floris<br>
  Abstract: When scientists in our day meddle with the humanities, the outcomes are not always uplifting. Sometimes they are, as when art historians and chemists supplement each other’s expertise quite nicely in establishing or disproving the authenticity of some famous painting. In my own discipline, the history of science, the contributions scientists make are rarely so productive, unless (as, for instance, with Thomas Kuhn) they turn themselves into professional historians. Professional scientists with a layman’s interest in history certainly tend to display a deep-seated emotional involvement in past manifestations of their own present-day concerns. But the flip side of their praiseworthy<br>

  3.4  Manuals on Historical Method: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Paul Herman<br>
  Abstract: Manuals on historical method from around 1900 are like neoscholastic philosophy textbooks: books that are supposed to be so dull and dreary that only few scholars dare venture into them. Although methodology manuals were once a flourishing genre, especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when such emerging academic disciplines as history, art history, and church history were in need of methodological signposts and boundary markers, the hundreds of pages that these manuals typically devote to the minutiae of internal and external source criticism now read like neoscholastic meditations on the

  Author(s) Karstens Bart<br>
  Abstract: This paper takes as its topic how the history of science, as a separate field of study, came into being in the early twentieth century and how it developed thereafter. The first signs of the institutionalization of the field as an academic discipline were the first international conference on the history of science held adjacent to the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900, the start of the journal
                  Isisin 1912, and the founding of the History of Science Society in 1924. This journal and the society still occupy a prominent position in the field today. The period also saw<br>

  Author(s) Most Glenn W.<br>
  Abstract: A century ago, one of the most important modes of research in the professional study of Greco-Roman antiquity as well as in a number of other fields was a recently developed specialty called by its admirers (back then it had no opponents) ‘
                  Quellenforschung’. By decomposing the compilatory handbooks produced by the erudition of late antiquity into their various sources and establishing the relations of dependence among them, the adepts of this method sought to trace back reports about a variety of aspects of the ancient world – primarily philosophy and history, but also religion, law, sculpture, and other matters –<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12877vs">The Making of the Humanities, vol. III</a><br>
  Author(s) Scheerlinck Eline<br>
  Abstract: As is the case for many of his colleagues within the humanities, it is hard to pin one label on Franz Cumont (1868-1947). His work moves at the crossroads of history of religions, classical philology, ancient history, archeology and Orientalism. However, Cumont employed this multidisciplinarity in such a way as to make him a pioneer within the developing field of history of religions at the turn of the nineteenth century. In what follows I will focus mainly on Cumont as a historian of religion and on the renewing role which he played in the development of the history of religions<br>

  Author(s) Baertschi Annette M.<br>
  Abstract: The digital revolution of the past years has profoundly changed higher education and the academic world in general. Not only has ‘much of the teaching and learning apparatus moved online’, thus effectuating new forms of classroom instruction, but ‘the computational technologies and methodologies’ available today have also ‘transformed research practices in every discipline’.¹ The digital humanities in particular have created exciting new tools, which have attracted a lot of attention within the scholarly community and received positive media coverage.² This in turn has boosted public interest in humanities research, especially in relation to new technologies that ‘facilitate insights into history,<br>

  Abstract: This paper discusses the place of New Philology in the history of textual criticism of ancient texts.

  Abstract: In 1866 Alfred Blot, a history teacher at the Collège Stanislas, published a re-edition of Louis de Beaufort’s 1738
                  Dissertation sur l’Incertitude des Cinq Premiers Siècles de l’Histoire Romaine[Fig. 4]. Out of print for more than a century, the main virtue of Beaufort’s work was to show systematically how little we know about the mythical past. The gist of Beaufort’s argument is that most of the early Roman historical record and monuments perished in the sack of the city by the Gauls in 387 or 390 BCE, and that of the two main sources we have today, Dionysius of<br>

  Author(s) Mersmann Birgit<br>
  Abstract: Within the realm of modernizing the humanities, the aspiration of art history to transform into a universal discipline and modern science manifests itself as a cultural, anthropological, and spatial orientation toward world art and universal history. The ground for this modern shift was prepared by the universalization of art as based on the concept of mutual cultural influences and historical transfers. At the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, art history joined forces with subbranches of history such as universal history and cultural history. Through these interdisciplinary linkages, it also opened to a new self-definition and revaluation as<br>

  Abstract: One of the operations included in philological inquiries is the restoration of etymologies, built up of linguistic units enduring through ages, languages, meanings, usages and contexts.² The following essay attempts a possible deployment of an etymology of the lingual unit ‘genre’. Our trail will be guided by two stations in the long and extended history of this etymon: First, the Aristotelian origins of the etymon ‘genre’ are reconsidered; second, attention is given to the presence of the same etymon in the vocabulary of modern art criticism.

  Author(s) Semi Maria<br>
  Abstract: The sciences and the humanities have a long tradition of cultural crossings and reciprocal influences; this interwoven history, however, has been first somehow minimized and downplayed during the nineteenth century, and then simply slipped into a far corner of our memories – feeding on contemporary hyperspecialization and high disciplinary boundaries – until recent scholarly work evidenced how our narrow contemporary perspective was compromising a thorough understanding of the modern era. Positivism and the professionalization of academic disciplines brought about a very critical attitude toward the intellectual syncretism of the foregoing centuries. This had several consequences as, as well described by<br>

  Author(s) Orell Julia<br>
  Abstract: Late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century Europe saw an increasing interest in non-European art from Africa, Pre-Columbian America, Asia, the Pacific Islands and elsewhere. Private collectors and museums eagerly collected, exhibited, and published such works, often in competition with each other in the context of colonization.¹ In addition to museums and collectors, artists developed a great interest in non-European art and artifacts since at least the mid-nineteenth century, ranging from Japanese woodcut prints to African masks, often summarized under the problematic category of primitivism. The academic discipline of art history, however, was slow in responding to the broadening range of images and objects<br>

  Author(s) Rock Jan<br>
  Abstract: The history of digital humanities may seem relatively short. The study of culture, history and humanity appears to have been affected by digital culture and networked computers for only about two decades. That is why usually not the past, but the future of digital humanities is discussed, conversation being flavored with possibilities and promises: greater convenience for scholarly labor, and increased speed in the consultation of data, the massive accessibility of which would enable the humanities to deal with their scientific arrears.<br>

  Author(s) Tobin Robert Deam<br>
  Abstract: Today, the study of sexuality brings together scholars from a wide variety of disciplines – history, politics, literature, religion, the arts, psychology, anthropology, medicine, and biology. At its best, this interdisciplinary work promotes critical self-reflection on disciplinary assumptions about sexuality and the data used to test those assumptions: Is there such a thing as a fixed sexuality and how would one prove its existence? Such questions have arisen ever since the emergence of the concept of ‘sexuality’ at the end of the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, theorists regarded humanistic and literary sources as high quality<br>

  Author(s) Ossewaarde Marinus<br>
  Abstract: Since its inauguration as an academic discipline after the July Revolution, in the 1830s, sociology has had a lasting ambivalent relationship to the humanities. On the one hand, Auguste Comte, who in 1838 had coined the word ‘sociology’ in a footnote to the 47
                  thlesson of hisCourse in Positive Philosophy(1830-1842), introduced the new science as a type of physics, ‘social physics’, patterned on the model of Newtonian physics. For Comte’s contemporary Alexis de Tocqueville, on the other hand, the ‘new science’ belonged to the humanities, in particular to political philosophy, theology, classical studies, rhetoric and history, inspired by<br>

  Author(s) Kempers Bram<br>
  Abstract: Sociology and its companion social sciences, such as cultural anthropology and psychology, enjoy ambivalent relations with one another, and with sections of the humanities, from cultural history to the study of languages. To complicate matters more, the relations with the natural sciences are ambiguous as well and subject to debate. Intellectuals never created a clear-cut and generally accepted classification of the arts and sciences concerned with human behavior. The cognitive quality of literature and the visual arts never disappeared. Literary authors still claim to enlighten

  Abstract: Doctrinal development may be an inevitable, even essential element of the theological task as it has been practiced for nearly two millennia, but explicit theoretical reflection on the nature of this phenomenon is a relatively recent feature in Christian thought. The history of evangelical attention to the problem of development is much shorter, because, as we shall see, Roman Catholic theologians began addressing the issue much earlier than their Protestant and evangelical counterparts.

  Abstract: On March 2, 1964, Karl Barth met a group of theology students from Tubingen at the Bruderholz Restaurant for a lengthy conversation. The group consisted of forty Protestants and five Catholics. Their recorded conversation ranged across a wide spectrum of theological topics, including the meaning of Christ’s resurrection, the doctrine of analogy, the distinction between “noetic” and “ontic,” recent developments in Roman Catholicism, and the history of dialectical theology and the Confessing Church. At one point an unknown student raised the topic of Eberhard Jungel’s recent interpretation of Barth’s

  Abstract: Neglected by secular scholars because of its religious content, reshaped by people of faith because its protagonists are morally offensive, and avoided by individuals committed to nonviolence because of its brutality, the book of Judges deserves to be taken more seriously. No other book in the Hebrew Bible mirrors the entire span of Israel’s history as authentically as Judges. The main body of the book is a collection of premonarchic tales celebrating heroic champions, who competed for power in turbulent times. The book’s sixth-century version reflects the tension between the priestly Deuteronomic reformers and the Deuteronomistic defenders of royal power.¹<br>

  Author(s) GORDON PETER E.<br>
  Abstract: In the history of religion the arrival of the millennium is often imagined as the έσχατον, an end of history or “end-time” that brings an apocalyptic and ultimate answer to all human questions. But the perennial quarrel between religion and philosophy can hardly be illustrated with greater force than by recalling that for Socrates the practice of philosophy remains forever marked by άπορεία. It is a mode of critical interrogation or

  Author(s) Schwartz Barry<br>
  Abstract: Late Second Temple period scholarship is premised on the belief that Jews of the time thought about the past differently from the way we do. Their knowledge was rooted in traditional legends and communal bonds; ours is data-driven, self-critical, and context-free. Both statements—history is subjective and situation-dependent, and history is objective and situation-transcendent—provoke ambivalence because both are partly but not absolutely true. The problem begins when this ambivalence inhibits us from applying the findings of modern research to instances of ancient memory, for these findings often tell us what it means to “remember,” help us dissect the complex<br>

  Abstract: Biblical studies has long been concerned with aspects of what is now called “cultural memory,” especially in the form of a preoccupation with tradition history.¹ Yet even though the major theorists of tradition history were active at the same time that Maurice Halbwachs and Aby Warburg were developing their ideas about cultural memory in society and art, there is no evidence of intellectual cross-fertilization. More recently, the debates over historiography in biblical studies in the 1990s raised in an acute fashion issues relating to the preservation of reliable data in the historical narratives of the Bible versus the invention of<br>

  Abstract: Fiction and history in the era after World War II are interlocking journeys by immigrants to America’s shores. This immigrant tide in contemporary American fiction is global, flowing across diasporas, borders, and postcolonial terrains. From the Holocaust to the Haitian and Cuban boatlifts, many of the departures and arrivals are reflections of recent historical traumas, creating in fiction what Bharati Mukherjee terms “odysseys of dislocation” (Woodford 2). Immigration for America’s short story writers and novelists today is the representation of radically new desires by the world’s uprooted peoples, an allegory chronicling the evolution of a multicultural nation-state.<br>

Numerous writers—Julia Alvarez, Oscar Hijuelos, Christina Garcia, and Judith Ortiz Cofer among them—share a vision of migration to American shores that is rooted in the imperial history of the hemisphere—the tradition of conquest and colonization experienced by the islands of the Caribbean.

Within this rite, the problem of identity emerges through the poet’s explorations of his personal history, a history that in time is set against the wider historical horizon of Heaney’s cultural past. Paradoxically, what gives his work continuity is his willingness to face discontinuity over again with each return to the source. Still, Heaney’s reliance on what has been called disparagingly a poetic of identity would appear to confirm Anthony Easthope’s criticism that Heaney’s poetry is “resolutely premodernist in its commitment to a<br>

My interviewees were conscious and intelligent witnesses to history Over countless cups of tea in sitting rooms, senior citizens’ centers, churches, and synagogues, they shared thoughts, ideas, and experiences; they allowed me to question and tape-record their lives. This is as close as we can get to the past; no museum reconstruction, no Cecil B. DeMille film, no fake verisimilitude can render history more truly than the words of those<br>

They are also the precious cultural capital of the generation that experienced the war. The many small stories told by the much-touted “ordinary people” of wartime London flow into the master narratives of European history; enriching them, enlivening them, and occasionally colliding with them.

  Abstract: The whole of creation history includes, among other things, human history. Perhaps the emerging field of Big History is the closest secular counterpart to the theologian’s creation history. Within the cosmic hsitory of creation, systematic theologians commonly include an anthropology—an explication of what is human—in their explication of Christian doctrine. Sometimes the anthropology appears between expositions of the First and Second Articles of the creeds—that is, between explications of God as Father and God as Son. The sorry state of the human condition explains why the good creation is in need of redemption. So theological anthropology fits<br>

  Book Title: The Catholic Studies Reader-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGUINNESS MARGARET M.<br>
  Abstract: The Catholic Studies Reader is a rare book in an emerging field that has neither a documented history nor a consensus as to what should be a normative methodology. Dividing this volume into five interrelated themes central to the practice and theory of Catholic Studies-Sources and Contexts, Traditions and Methods, Pedagogy and Practice, Ethnicity, Race, and Catholic Studies, and The Catholic Imagination-the editors provide readers with the opportunity to understand the great diversity within this area of study. Readers will find informative essays on the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic social teaching, as well as reflections on the arts and literature. This provocative and enriching collection is valuable not only for scholars but also for lay and religious Catholics working in Catholic education in universities, high schools, and parish schools.<br>

                  A History of the Roman Catholic Community in the United Stateswas published in 1981, even as James Fisher was studying American cultural history down the New Jersey Turnpike at Rutgers. Although other scholars, including Notre Dame’s Philip Gleason and Jay Dolan, were also writing about American Catholicism at this time, McGuinness’s church history classes were paying very little attention to their work, focusing primarily on the U.S. Protestant experience.

  Author(s) HOANG LINH<br>
  Abstract: A standard narrative of American religious history has relied on the Puritan sense of a common purpose. John Winthrop’s famous “City on a Hill” speech to the Pilgrims is emblematic of this. This narrative of election and purpose has shaped the way other religions have been measured. But in doing so it has neglected the voice of religious dissenters and the significance of racial diversity within the ranks of American Christians. Likewise, social science and historical studies of immigrants and refugees tend to gloss over religious affiliation and focus mainly on adaptation or assimilation processes into American culture.

  Abstract: Theologians ruminate among inherited concepts and images, seeking to clarify their history and judge it critically. To establish a perspective in which even a single such concept can be brought into question or deconstructed is no easy matter. To bring the entire tradition into perspective and retrieve it in a well-founded way, as Heidegger aimed to retrieve the tradition of Western metaphysics, is a prodigious task. Recently, a larger context for that task has emerged as Christians have learned that their entire tradition is only one fiber in the texture of the human religious quest.

  Abstract: Prayer, both private and public, is one of the most common of human activities. All human history records it; its roots probably go back to before recorded history. Yet when we attempt to submit its most common form, that of petition, to philosophical analysis, we run into difficulties. All too often we pray for things, such as victory or gaining a desired position, and forget that there are losers in such competitions. Prayer, here, seems caught in the “mimetic violence” that René Girard describes. According to Girard, our socialization involves our imitating others. It thus leads us to desire what<br>

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Abstract: The history of the Jewish people, in large measure, is a history of exile, captivity, and diaspora—and also a story of redemption. The book of Exodus reports about the tribulations the Jewish people endured during their exile in Egypt, before Moses led them out into the wilderness. The same book also speaks of a promised land and of the “steadfast love” with which God guides the people to his “holy abode” (Exod. 15:13).

  Abstract: Amid the multitudinous variety of historical, ethnographic, and cultural studies taking place within the academy, one can detect a certain crisis or at least confusion regarding theoretical discourse about religion. This confusion refers to the felt discord among heterogeneous languages and incommensurable modes of description and questioning. Such languages include traditional theology, analytic philosophy of religion, hermeneutics and other symbolic-semiotic languages, methodological approaches to the history of religions, and various forms of postmodernism. This confusion is felt at the same time as religion is being taken up by many philosophers and theorists as an important topic for understanding, in part<br>

  Book Title: Saintly Influence: Edith Wyschogrod and the Possibilities of Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAVKA MARTIN<br>
  Abstract: Since the publication of her first book, Emmanuel Levinas: The Problem of Ethical Metaphysics, in 1974-the first book about Levinas published in English-Edith Wyschogrod has been at the forefront of the fields of Continental philosophy and philosophy of religion. Her work has crossed many disciplinary boundaries, making peregrinations from phenomenology and moral philosophy to historiography, the history of religions (both Western and non-Western), aesthetics, and the philosophy of biology. In all of these discourses, she has sought to cultivate an awareness of how the self is situated and influenced, as well as the ways in which a self can influence others.In this volume, twelve scholars examine and display the influence of Wyschogrod's work in essays that take up the thematics of influence in a variety of contexts: Christian theology, the saintly behavior of the villagers of Le Chambon sur Lignon, the texts of the medieval Jewish mystic Abraham Abulafia, the philosophies of Levinas, Derrida, and Benjamin, the practice of intellectual history, the cultural memory of the New Testament, and pedagogy.In response, Wyschogrod shows how her interlocutors have brought to light her multiple authorial personae and have thus marked the ambiguity of selfhood, its position at the nexus of being influenced by and influencing others.<br>

  Abstract: Gedanken sind frei. Thoughts are free. Thinking is autonomous. Philosophers are free because they are able to receive, accept or refuse, distance, display, suspend, or focus on all that exists or has been thought. But philosophy is never first (except,perhaps, in a quite abstract sense of being first), because, before beginning to practice it, philosophers have already been educated, formed, accustomed to a particular language and culture, become part of an ongoing history, and set on a certain path.<br>

But the first thing he said was unexpected: “I dream of being a historian.” He expressed his feeling that, in a way, ever since

  Abstract: In

I believe this apparent omission may be more adequately identified as a sign of modesty, of two sorts. I will suggest that, if we press the logic of her argument in ways she does<br>

  Author(s) BURRUS VIRGINIA<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of human subjects, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Veering off the well-worn path of sexual moralizing, this volume explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics even as it also deliberately disrupts the disciplinary boundaries of theology. Indeed, it invites and performs a mutual seduction of disciplines—theology, philosophy, scripture, history—at multiple sites charged by desires at once bodily, spiritual, intellectual, and political. It seeks new openings<br>

  Book Title: Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SMITH DAVID NOWELL<br>
  Abstract: Sounding/Silence charts Heidegger's deep engagement with poetry, situating it within the internal dynamics of his thought and within the domains of poetics and literary criticism. Heidegger viewed poetics and literary criticism with notorious disdain: he claimed that his Erlauterungen ("soundings") of Holderlin's poetry were not "contributions to aesthetics and literary history" but rather stemmed "from a necessity for thought." And yet, the questions he poses--the value of significance of prosody and trope, the concept of "poetic language", the relation between language and body, the "truth" of poetry--reach to the very heart of poetics as a discipline, and indeed situate Heidegger within a wider history of thinking on poetry and poetics. opening up points of contact between Heidegger's discussions of poetry and technical and critical analyses of these poems, Nowell Smith addresses a lacuna within Heidegger scholarship and sets off from Heidegger's thought to sketch a philosophical "poetics of limit".<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x044k">Sounding/Silence: Martin Heidegger at the Limits of Poetics</a><br>

To an extent this is unsurprising and even, one feels—in the light of his contempt for “the history of literature and aesthetics” (EHP 21/7)—solicited. Yet the surfeit of commentary on Heidegger as a “train-wreck” exegete risks occluding the other term in Kommerell’s oxymoron, or the possibility that the two are interlinked: that as the reading is, as it were, derailed, it opens on<br>

  Abstract: Modern environmentalism has come to realize that many of its key concerns "wilderness" and "nature" among them are contested territory, viewed differently by different people. Understanding nature requires science and ecology, to be sure, but it also requires a sensitivity tom, history, culture, and narrative. Thus, understanding nature is a fundamentally hermeneutic task.<br>

  Author(s) McGrath Sean<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, I situate Timothy Morton’s and Slavoj Žižek’s “ecology without nature” (hereafter EWN) within the broader history of transcendental-structuralist ontology.¹ I will argue that, notwithstanding Morton’s recent turn to object-oriented ontology, his deconstruction of a certain notion of nature, which we provisionally describe as the extra-lingual intelligible order, does not deviate from the a-cosmic trajectory of late modern thinking, from nineteenth-century transcendental philosophy, through hermeneutics and semiotics to Lacanian psychoanalysis. Even if something like nature in fact existed, the argument goes, we would have little to say about it, locked as we are into a self-referential meaning system,<br>

  Book Title: Finding God in All Things: Celebrating Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stagaman David<br>
  Abstract: Three of the most influential Catholic theologians of the twentieth century-Bernard Lonergan, John Courtney Murray, and Karl Rahner-were all born in 1904, at the height of the Church's most militant rhetoric against all things modern. In this culture of suspicion, Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner grew in faith to join the Society of Jesus and struggled with the burden of antimodernist policies in their formation. By the time of their mature work in the 1950s and 1960s, they had helped to redefine the critical dialogue between modern thought and contemporary Catholic theology. After the dtente of the Second Vatican Council, they brought Catholic tradition into closer relationship to modern philosophy, history, and politics. Written by leading scholars, friends, and family members, these original essays celebrate the legacies of Lonergan, Murray, and Rahner after a century of theological development. Offering a broad range of perspectives on their lives and works, the essays blend personal and anecdotal accounts with incisive critical appraisals. Together, they offer an accessible introduction to the distinctive character of three great thinkers and how their work shapes the way Catholics think and talk about God, Church, and State.<br>

  Book Title: Translating Investments: Metaphor and the Dynamics of Cultural Change in Tudor-Stuart England-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: The title Translating Investments, a manifold pun, refers to metaphor and clothing, authority and interest, and trading and finance. Translation, Latin translatio, is historically a name for metaphor, and investment, etymologically a reference to clothing, participates both in the complex symbolism of early modern dress and in the cloth trade of the period. In this original and wide-ranging book, Judith Anderson studies the functioning of metaphor as a constructive force within language, religious doctrine and politics, literature, rhetoric, and economics during the reigns of the Tudors and early Stuarts. Invoking a provocative metaphorical concept from Andy Clark's version of cognitive science, she construes metaphor itself as a form of scaffolding fundamental to human culture. A more traditional and controversial conception of such scaffolding is known as sublation-Hegel's Aufhebung, or raising,as the philosophers Jacques Derrida and Paul Ricoeur have understood this term. Metaphor is the agent of raising, or sublation, and sublation is inseparable from the productive life of metaphor, as distinct in its death in code or clich. At the same time, metaphor embodies the sense both of partial loss and of continuity, or preservation, also conveyed by the term Aufhebung. Anderson's study is simultaneously critical and historical. History and the theory are shown to be mutually enlightening, as are a wide variety of early modern texts and their specific cultural contexts. From beginning to end, this study touches the present, engaging questions about language, rhetoric, and reading within post-structuralism and neo-cognitivism. It highlights connections between intellectual problems active in our own culture and those evident in the earlier texts, controversies, and crises Anderson analyzes. In this way, the study is bifocal, like metaphor itself. While Anderson's overarching concern is with metaphor as a creative exchange, a source of code-breaking conceptual power, each of her chapters focuses on a different but related issue and cultural sector. Foci include the basic conditions of linguistic meaning in the early modern period, instantiated by Shakespeare's plays and related to modern theories of metaphor; the role of metaphor in the words of eucharistic institution under Archbishop Cranmer; the play of metaphor and metonymy in the writings of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin and in John Donne's Devotions; the manipulation of these two tropes in the politics of the controversy over ecclesiastical vestments and in its treatment by John Foxe; the abuse of figuration in the house of Edmund Spenser's Busirane, where catachresis, an extreme form of metaphor, is the trope du jour; the conception of metaphor in the Roman rhetorics and their legacy in the sixteenth century; and the concept of exchange in the economic writing of Gerrard de Malynes, merchant and metaphorist in the reigns of Elizabeth and James. What emerges at the end of this book is a heightened critical sense of the dynamic of metaphor in cultural history.<br>

                  Monarchy, Dante argues against those who maintained that the foundation of faith consists in the traditions of the church. He distinguishes three stages in the history of Scripture: before the church (i.e. the Old and the New Testament), with the church (the early fathers), and after the church (thedecretales). In defining the first stage, the stageante Ecclesiam, Dante states that “this is what the Church says speaking to her bridegroom: ‘Draw me after thee.’ ”¹ The standard footnote tells us that this sentence—“Trahe me post te” in the Vulgate’s Latin—is a quotation<br>

  Book Title: Believing Scholars: Ten Catholic Intellectuals-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burrell David B.<br>
  Abstract: How do Catholic intellectuals draw on faith in their work? And how does their work as scholars influence their lives as people of faith?For more than a generation, the University of Dayton has invited a prominent Catholic intellectual to present the annual Marianist Award Lecture on the general theme of the encounter of faith and profession. Over the years, the lectures have become central to the Catholic conversation about church, culture, and society.In this book, ten leading figures explore the connections in their own lives between the private realms of faith and their public calling as teachers, scholars, and intellectuals.This last decade of Marianist Lectures brings together theologians and philosophers, historians, anthropologists, academic scholars, and lay intellectuals and critics.Here are Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J., on the tensions between faith and theology in his career; Jill Ker Conway on the spiritual dimensions of memory and personal narrative; Mary Ann Glendon on the roots of human rights in Catholic social teaching; Mary Douglas on the fruitful dialogue between religion and anthropology in her own life; Peter Steinfels on what it really means to be a liberal Catholic; and Margaret O'Brien Steinfels on the complicated history of women in today's church. From Charles Taylor and David Tracy on the fractured relationship between Catholicism and modernity to Gustavo Gutirrez on the enduring call of the poor and Marcia Colish on the historic links between the church and intellectual freedom, these essays track a decade of provocative, illuminating, and essential thought. James L. Heft, S.M., is President and Founding Director of the Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies and University Professor of Faith and Culture and Chancellor, University of Dayton. He has edited Beyond Violence: Religious Sources for Social Transformation in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (Fordham).<br>

  Abstract: The history of our time is a history of change, really of revolutionary change. Revolutions in the sciences, in weaponry, in international relations, in agriculture, in cooking, in relations between men and women, in gender identity, in child rearing. The essential measures of our earthly existence, time and space, we understand in far more complex ways that we did even twenty years ago. Furthermore, all such changes themselves become the springboard for ever greater change, what the British sociologist Anthony Giddens calls “institutional reflexivity.” By that he means “the regularized use of knowledge about circumstances of social life as a<br>

  Author(s) Macey David<br>
  Abstract: There was, in the nineteenth century, a widespread and lasting conviction that one cannot discern the transformations that occur in political society—that one cannot really take stock of what is appearing, disappearing, or reappearing—without examining the religious significance of the old and the new. In both France and Germany, philosophy, history, the novel, and poetry all testify to that. This conviction is not, of course, entirely new, and it can be traced far back in history.

  Author(s) de Vries Hent<br>
  Abstract: At intervals of about ten years, Levinas devoted articles to Spinoza.¹ At first glance, these readings stand out for their critical, indeed, polemical tone. In his 1955 “The Case of Spinoza” Levinas accepts Jacob Gordin’s summary verdict: “Spinoza was guilty of betrayal [

  Abstract: To write about surrealism and theology seems an almost heretical act, on both sides of the equation. Like other Romantic and post-Romantic artistic movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, surrealism owes a debt to mysticism and the occult that is already widely acknowledged, as is the occurrence of religious symbolism throughout its corpus. Were these works of art equal to the sum total of the surrealist interventions in the theological realm, there would be little more to discuss.

  Abstract: Jaroslav Pelikan, the well-known Yale historian of Christian doctrine, worried whether his grandchildren would have a religious tradition to reject. So pervasive did he consider the acidic effects of modern Western culture on religion that he feared that communities of faith would, over the coming generation or two, simply dissolve. Historians are rarely given to apocalyptic prediction; rather, they typically warn us about repeating the history from which we have never learned. But Pelikan has not been the only person who has worried about religion’s future in the West. Religious leaders and sociologists and theologians have been asking similar questions:<br>

  Book Title: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Vladimir Jankelevitch: The Time of Forgiveness traces the reflections of the French philosopher and musicologist Vladimir Jankelevitch on the conditions and temporality of forgiveness in relation to creation, history, and memory. The author demonstrates the influence of Jewish and Christian thought on Jankelevitch's philosophy and compares his ideas about the gift character of forgiveness, the role of retributive emotions in conceptions of justice, and the limits of reason with those of Aristotle, Butler, Kant, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Scheler, Arendt, Derrida, Levinas, and Ricoeur. The Shoah was the pivotal historical event in Jankelevitch's life. As this book shows, Jankelevitch's question "Is forgiveness possible as a response to evil?" remains a potent philosophical conundrum today. Paradoxically, for Jankelevitch, evil is both the impetus and the obstacle to forgiveness.<br>

  Book Title: The Architecture of Concepts: The Historical Formation of Human Rights-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de Bolla Peter<br>
  Abstract: The Architecture of Concepts proposes a radically new way of understanding the history of ideas. Taking as its example human rights, it develops a distinctive kind of conceptual analysis that enables us to see with precision how the concept of human rights was formed in the eighteenth century. The first chapter outlines an innovative account of concepts as cultural entities. The second develops an original methodology for recovering the historical formation of the concept of human rights based on data extracted from digital archives. This enables us to track the construction of conceptual architectures over time. Having established the architecture of the concept of human rights, the book then examines two key moments in its historical formation: the First Continental Congress in 1775 and the publication of Tom Paine's Rights of Man in 1792. Arguing that we have yet to fully understand or appreciate the consequences of the eighteenth-century invention of the concept "rights of man," the final chapter addresses our problematic contemporary attempts to leverage human rights as the most efficacious way of achieving universal equality<br>

  Abstract: The title of this essay—“Enabling God”—can be read both ways. God enabling us, us enabling God. As such, it affirms the freedom that characterizes our relationship to the divine as a mutual act of giving. So doing, it challenges traditional concepts of God as omnipotence. The notion of an all-powerful, autonomous, and self-sufficient deity has a long history ranging from the self-thinking-thought of Aristotelian ontology to the self-subsisting-act (
                  ipsum esse subsistens) or self-causing-cause (ens causa sui) of medieval scholasticism and modern rationalism (Spinoza, Leibniz). It is a powerful lineage pertaining to a powerful concept of a powerful God.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle, in distinguishing between actuality (ἐνέργεια) and possibility (δύναμις), undertook two crucial steps that have haunted the history of Western metaphysics ever since: he gave a qualitative priority to actuality over potency, and then he identified the former with pure essence. Possibility, for Aristotle, is a mode that denotes transition and corruption, and thus imperfection. However, the risk that he acknowledges and fears most is that potency is ambiguous and undecidable. In his words, “the possible could be both a being and a non-being … it could equally be both things and neither” (1050b10, 1051a1). It is this

  Abstract: The specter of centrifugal forces, which threaten to tear our country apart, has haunted us throughout our history. Josiah Royce stands out as one of our most perceptive critics and the creator of a philosophy that could heal the dangerous tendency toward fragmentation and disintegration. Royce’s work lies before us as a national treasure, but mostly a buried treasure. His situation reminds one of a remark that novelist Walker Percy made about Charles Sanders Peirce: “Most people have never heard of him, but they will.”¹ Josiah Royce’s Philosophy of Loyalty remains little known outside of specialized American philosophy, and even<br>

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Abstract: As we saw in Chapter 1, one of the achievements of Arendt’s and Benjamin’s critiques of history is to have drawn attention to the ways in which modern history effectively eliminates the dimension of human experience from its discursive structure. The question remains, though, as to how to situate the concept of experience with respect to this devaluation, especially given that one of the single most important innovations of modern philosophy was to have grounded knowledge in experience itself. In short: If modern history all but eliminates experience from its discourse, it is no less the case that the modern<br>

  Abstract: The imagination is notoriously difficult to define.¹ Indeed, this difficulty may explain the fact that prior to the Enlightenment there was no attempt to develop a unified theory of the imagination. In the history of ancient Greek philosophy, its amorphous character contributed to its being treated in two distinct, albeit related, ways. On the one hand, imagination was defined in terms of inspired artistic expression, outside the realm of explanation and description. On the other, it was described as a mysterious mental faculty that somehow accomplished the impossible, bridging the divide between the world of sensation and the world of<br>

A look through his unpublished papers points to an obsession with the work and lives of those “great men” of extraordinary mental powers—from Michelangelo, to Mozart, to Edgar Allan Poe. Like his contemporary Josiah Royce, Peirce was fascinated by history and, more particularly, by the history of genius. This fascination might be attributed to Peirce’s arrogant but not inaccurate suspicion that he would some day join the ranks of these “great men.” I would suggest that Peirce’s fascination relates to a<br>

Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.”¹ The effort to clarify this maxim might be said to constitute the subsequent history of pragmatism.

  Book Title: Reading the Allegorical Intertext: Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Judith H. Anderson conceives the intertext as a relation between or among texts that encompasses both Kristevan intertextuality and traditional relationships of influence, imitation, allusion, and citation. Like the Internet, the intertext is a state, or place, of potential expressed in ways ranging from deliberate emulation to linguistic free play. Relatedly, the intertext is also a convenient fiction that enables examination of individual agency and sociocultural determinism. Anderson's intertext is allegorical because Spenser's Faerie Queene is pivotal to her study and because allegory, understood as continued or moving metaphor, encapsulates, even as it magnifies, the process of signification. Her title signals the variousness of an intertext extending from Chaucer through Shakespeare to Milton and the breadth of allegory itself. Literary allegory, in Anderson's view, is at once a mimetic form and a psychic one-a process thinking that combines mind with matter, emblem with narrative, abstraction with history. Anderson's first section focuses on relations between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Spenser's The Faerie Queene, including the role of the narrator, the nature of the textual source, the dynamics of influence, and the bearing of allegorical narrative on lyric vision. The second centers on agency and cultural influence in a variety of Spenserian and medieval texts. Allegorical form, a recurrent concern throughout, becomes the pressing issue of section three. This section treats plays and poems of Shakespeare and Milton and includes two intertextually relevant essays on Spenser.How Paradise Lost or Shakespeare's plays participate in allegorical form is controversial. Spenser's experiments with allegory revise its form, and this intervention is largely what Shakespeare and Milton find in his poetry and develop. Anderson's book, the result of decades of teaching and writing about allegory, especially Spenserian allegory, will reorient thinking about fundamental critical issues and the landmark texts in which they play themselves out.<br>

  Author(s): Chiu Monica<br>
  Abstract: The global circulation of comics, manga, and other such visual mediums between North America and Asia produces transnational meanings no longer rooted in a separation between “Asian” and “American.” Drawing New Color Lines explores the culture, production, and history of contemporary graphic narratives that depict Asian Americans and Asians. It examines how Japanese manga and Asian popular culture have influenced Asian American comics; how these comics and Asian American graphic narratives depict the “look” of race; and how these various representations are interpreted in nations not of their production. By focusing on what graphic narratives mean for audiences in North America and those in Asia, the collection discusses how Western theories about the ways in which graphic narratives might successfully overturn derogatory caricatures are themselves based on contested assumptions; and illustrates that the so-called odorless images featured in Japanese manga might nevertheless elicit interpretations about race in transnational contexts. With contributions from experts based in North America and Asia, Drawing New Color Lines will be of interest to scholars in a variety of disciplines, including Asian American studies, cultural and literary studies, comics and visual studies.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past several years many undergraduate students have come to rely more readily on various graphic narrative-type representations of history. The “cartoonification” of multiple interpretations of the past has become a way for them to distill large amounts of information into “chewable bites” as well as to help them remember facts and ideas that they might forget without a visual reminder of meanings.

  Book Title: Dostoevsky and the Novel-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Holquist Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Holquist shows that the generic impulse of the novel to explore the mysteries of individual biography met and fused in Dostoevsky's works with the national quest of the Russians for an identity of their own. The paradox of the writer's achievement consists in the degree to which his meditations on the significance of being without a past are grounded in history.<br>

  Abstract: Russia is always being discovered, or at least since the sixteenth century, when disputes arose in Europe as to whether von Herberstein or Sir Richard Chancellor could claim the honor of what Hakluyt was to call “the strange and wonderful discovery of Russia.” For Milton in the seventeenth century and Voltaire in the eighteenth, Russia was still resistant to symmetrical English or French models of time and space, linear history, and binary (occident/orient) geography. One of the reasons Westerners still find it difficult to classify Russia is that the Russians themselves have never been quite sure where and when they<br>

  Abstract: Dostoevsky’s role in the history of the novel is determined by his use of the novel to interrogate history. The growing privilege that attached to history from the Renaissance through the Enlightenment peaked in the nineteenth century, an age in which the modern conception of its study was born. It is, of course, a gross oversimplification, if perhaps a necessary one, to say that before Niebuhr and Von Ranke each nation or each religion compiled a past that took into account “what had really happened” only insofar as the facts provided a sanction for the present.

  Abstract: The main difficulty in discussing chance in historiography is the fact that this subject has its own history, which as yet is unwritten. It is certainly impossible to discuss the role of chance in any given situation without first taking into account the whole terminology of the historian concerned. One needs to ask what is the opposite term that will exclude chance, or what is the overall term that makes it relative. Raymond Aron, for instance, begins his introduction to the philosophy of history with the antithesis, based on Cournot, between “

  Abstract: At first sight, history in the realm of the arts presents two con tradictory views. With the first, it would appear that the history of architecture, music, or poetry is more consistent and more coherent than that of society. The chronological sequence of works of art is more closely connected than a chain of political events, and the more gradual transformations of style are easier to follow than the transformations of social history.

  Abstract: Anyone working in a historical discipline experiences within himself, at certain times, a sympathetic reverberation of Stephen Dedalus’s cry that history is a nightmare from which he must awake. This feeling of suffocation steals over the philosopher when he attends to the long tradition of texts and studies in his field. Then, the history of philosophy seems to be an externally imposed and pressing structure, controlled entirely by lines of investigation laid out in the far distant past and extending into one’s present activity only in order to cramp and discourage the creative mind.

  Abstract: We sometimes imagine the history of philosophy as being a Janus-faced colossus.¹ One of its legs is firmly planted in times past and the other in the present, just as one face is pointed resolutely toward the sources and the other toward contemporary discussion. This metaphor serves a good purpose in suggesting the wide diversity of materials and comparative questions which fall within the historian’s responsibility. But it blurs over the ground of their “interface” or communicative union, and hence it cannot ward off the tendency to introduce a neat split, down the middle, between man’s historical interests looking to<br>

  Book Title: Value and Values-Economics and Justice in an Age of Global Interdependence<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Hershock Peter D.<br>
  Abstract: Especially in the aftermath of what is now being called the Great Recession, awareness has mounted of the imperative to question the modern divorce of economics from ethics. While the domains of economics and ethics were from antiquity through at least the eighteenth century understood in many cultures to be coterminous and mutually entailing, the modern assumption has been that the goal of maximizing human prosperity and the aim of justly enhancing our lives as persons and as communities were functionally and practically distinct. Working from a wide array of perspectives, the contributors to this volume offer a set of challenges to the assumed independence of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human and planetary well-being. Reflecting on the complex interrelationship among economics, justice, and equity, the book resists "one size fits all" approaches and struggles to revitalize the marriage of economics and ethics by activating cultural differences as the basis of mutual contribution to shared human flourishing. The publication of this important collection will stimulate or extend critical debates among scholars and students working in a number of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, including philosophy, history, environmental studies, economics, and law.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan-Modernity, Loss, and the Doing of History<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Karlin Jason G.<br>
  Abstract: Gender and Nation in Meiji Japan is a historical analysis of the discourses of nostalgia in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Japan. Through an analysis of the experience of rapid social change in Japan’s modernization, it argues that fads (ryūkō) and the desires they express are central to understanding Japanese modernity, conceptions of gender, and discourses of nationalism. In doing so, the author uncovers the myth of eternal return that lurks below the surface of Japanese history as an expression of the desire to find meaning amid the chaos and alienation of modern times. The Meiji period (1868–1912) was one of rapid change that hastened the process of forgetting: The state’s aggressive program of modernization required the repression of history and memory. However, repression merely produced new forms of desire seeking a return to the past, with the result that competing or alternative conceptions of the nation haunted the history of modern Japan. Rooted in the belief that the nation was a natural and organic entity that predated the rational, modern state, such conceptions often were responses to modernity that envisioned the nation in opposition to the modern state. What these visions of the nation shared was the ironic desire to overcome the modern condition by seeking the timeless past. While the condition of their repression was often linked to the modernizing policies of the Meiji state, the means for imagining the nation in opposition to the state required the construction of new symbols that claimed the authority of history and appealed to a rearticulated tradition. Through the idiom of gender and nation, new reified representations of continuity, timelessness, and history were fashioned to compensate for the unmooring of inherited practices from the shared locales of everyday life. This book examines the intellectual, social, and cultural factors that contributed to the rapid spread of Western tastes and styles, along with the backlash against Westernization that was expressed as a longing for the past. By focusing on the expressions of these desires in popular culture and media texts, it reveals how the conflation of mother, countryside, everyday life, and history structured representations to naturalize ideologies of gender and nationalism.<br>

  Abstract: Amid the modernization of Japan from the late nineteenth century, hero worship became an important ideological tool for molding adolescent boys into men who could serve the Japanese empire. In history, the figure of the hero is a cultural construct of idealized masculinity that arises within the context of a struggle over the gendered order. Since the meaning of gender is, as Judith Butler argues, always deferred as a kind of imitation for which there is no original, the maintenance of masculine values requires the relentless production of ideologies of gender to reinforce the subordination of women and the dominant<br>

  Abstract: The Meiji period was a time of intense social and cultural transformation. The acceleration of history and endless renewal of fashion created a sense of disjuncture and difference that allowed Meiji Japan to imagine itself as the victim of a deformative process of cultural loss and foreign invasion. Fashion is above all else a ritual of forgetting that celebrates novelty and obliviousness to the past.¹ Pierre Nora argues that a memorial consciousness emerges under just such conditions wherein society becomes deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal. According to Nora, this condition is “one that inherently values the new<br>

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction Lyotard posits between the postmodern and romantic sublime is finally untenable.<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmakers themselves had to confront the self-destructive aspects of their ethnic background, not only to accommodate WASP audiences but to better understand their own heritage. He also observes that ethnicity is a strong draw at the box office, as in The Godfather, because it creates a sense of the Other who can both be admired and at the same time ridiculed. Illustrated with scenes of the movies discussed, this fascinating film history tells how four of America's most famous filmmakers assimilated their ethnic backgrounds on set and on screen. "Mr. Lourdeaux walks a tricky path in analyzing the films of each [director]: avoiding the trap of excessively detailing their lives and many films, while steering clear of ethnic stereotyping. Those interested in ethnic influences on outstanding persons or in the production of films by four of the best will find the book enjoyable." --The Baltimore Sun "This is an invaluable book because it arouses critical awareness of the ethnicity underlying many Hollywood movies that might otherwise appear merely to represent American archetypes." --Journal of American Studies "A valuable addition to the literature on ethnic identity in film. The insights Lourdeaux offers into major figures like Griffith, Ford, Capra, Coppola, and Scorsese contribute significantly to our understanding of their films." --Virginia Wright Wexman, University of Illinois at Chicago "For a number of years now, church historians have been giving us an account of American Catholicism that is much richer and more varied than the older institutional accounts of the Catholic Church ever let on. In this comprehensive and insightful study, Lee Lourdeaux shows us how much the ethnic movies of directors like Ford and Capra, Coppola and Scorsese have to teach us as well about Irish- and Italian-Catholic mores and instincts." --John B. Breslin, S.J., Director "A wonderfully sensitive, intelligent study of the complex issue of how the Catholic imagination works in the creative personalities of those raised in the Catholic heritage." --Andrew M.

  Book Title: The Roots Of Thinking-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sheets-Johnstone Maxine<br>
  Abstract: "A significant contribution to the study of early humans, this book is a philosophical anthropology.... it makes genuinely novel, and highly persuasive, claims within the field itself." --David Depew In this ground-breaking interdisciplinary study about conceptual origins, Maxine Sheets-Johnstone shows that there is an indissoluble bond between hominid thinking and hominid evolution, a bond cemented by the living body. Her thesis is concretely illustrated in eight paleoanthropological case studies ranging from tool-using/tool-making to counting, sexuality, representation, language, death, and cave art. In each case, evidence is brought forward that shows how thinking is modeled on the body-specifically, how concepts are generated by animate form and the tactile-kinesthetic experience. Later chapters critically examine key theoretical and methodological issues posed by the thesis, Sheets-Johnstone demonstrates in detail how and why a corporeal turn in philosophy and the human sciences can yield insights no less extraordinary than those produced by the linguistic turn. In confronting the currently popular doctrine of cultural relativism and the classic Western metaphysical dualism of mind and body, she shows how pan-cultural invariants of human bodily life have been discounted and how the body itself has not been given its due. By a precise exposition of how a full-scale hermeneutics and a genetic phenomenology may be carried out with respect to conceptual origins, she shows how methodological issues are successfully resolved. "Ranging across the humanities and sciences, this thoroughly original book challenges both traditional metaphysics and contemporary cultural relativism. In their place, it persuasively develops a phenomenonological, tactile-kinesthetic account of the origins of thinking. This philosophical anthropology could not be more timely. It replaces the 'linguistic turn' with a promising new 'corporeal turn.'" --John J. Stuhr, University of Oregon "This work takes a much-needed stand in the inter-disciplinary field of philosophical anthropology. Sheets-Johnstone is well-read in the history of philosophy and in contemporary anthropology. The point of view she offers is inventive, insightful, well-established, and fruitful." --Thomas M. Alexander, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale<br>

  Abstract: This book is about conceptual origins. In particular, it addresses the question of the conceptual origin of fundamental human practices and beliefs that arose far back in evolutionary human history: tool-making, counting, consistent bipedality, language, the concept of death, engraving and painting. Typically, answers to questions about origins—how a verbal language originated, how counting began, for example—take for granted the very concepts basic to the practice, the concept of oneself as a sound-maker in the case of language, for instance, or the concept of numbers in the case of counting. Insofar as fundamental human practices and beliefs entail<br>

  Book Title: Studies in Philosophy for Children-Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery<br>
  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lipman Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery, created by Matthew Lipman in 1969, is now a widely used and highly successful tool for teaching philosophy to children. As the original novel of the Philosophy for Children program, its goal is to present major ideas in the history of philosophy, nurturing children's ability to think for themselves. At present, it is taught in 5,000 schools in the United States and has been translated into eighteen languages worldwide. This collection of essays reflects upon the development, refinement, and maturation of Philosophy for Children and on its relationship to the tradition of philosophy itself.<br>

  Abstract: PHILOSOPHY FOR CHILDREN is an attempt to reconstruct and present the history of philosophy in such a way that children can appropriate it for themselves so as to reason well in a self-correcting manner. For children to develop the ability to think well for themselves about matters of importance, what is required is an educational enterprise consisting of philosophical dialogue within the context of a classroom community of inquiry. Such a community concerns itself with the development of good critical and creative thinking and the cultivation of good judgment. But it is much more than this: Philosophy for Children is<br>

  Abstract: THE PROJECT of connecting philosophical concepts in the Philosophy for Children curriculum with the concepts in academic philosophy from which they were derived (or that they resemble) can be of considerable value for teachers and scholars wishing to ascertain the grounds of the curriculum in the philosophical tradition. We should not, however, restrict such an inquiry to philosophical concepts and the history of philosophy.

  Author(s) Madigan Edward<br>
  Abstract: The years between 1912 and 1923 were arguably the most transformative in modern Irish history. Beginning with the mass signing of the Ulster Covenant and ending with a bloody civil conflict in the nascent Free State, this long decade of war, revolution and rapid social change gave birth to contemporary Ireland, North and South. Many of us hold different, even conflicting, views on the real significance of this violent but fascinating period, and we are unlikely to reach a consensus on episodes as contentious as the Easter Rising, the Battle of the Somme or the War of Independence.

  Author(s) McGarry Fearghal<br>
  Abstract: By exploring the question of what republicanism meant to the rebels of 1916, before the Rising became burdened by the weight of its own myth, this chapter seeks to identify some connections between the history of an event and its commemoration. It emphasises how unpredictable the Rising’s success in creating popular support for republicanism was, and argues that this contingent outcome was largely a product of its wartime context. Although the Rising is now synonymous with republicanism, its ideological significance was less apparent at the time: many rebels fought for Irish freedom rather than a republic.

  Abstract: History and commemoration are not incompatible, but the proper relationship between these two pursuits is contested and uneasy. As participants in the public debates and manifestations associated with the current ‘decade [

  Abstract: This chapter discusses theological foundations for knowledge of God. Our approach emphasizes the conversion of the theologian and builds on previous chapters by illustrating how a theologian’s fourfold conversion determines the horizon within which discourse about God becomes meaningful. The chapter begins by identifying the main lines or themes of several major conversations about knowledge of God in the history of philosophy and theology. In this way, the reader may gain a sense of how our discussion of foundations allows us to revisit classic themes or questions about God.<br>

  Abstract: The task of foundations is not to preempt doctrines, but at the same time, sound foundations provide heuristic anticipations of doctrines, especially as these foundations emerge out of dialectical conflicts of interpretations of the history of doctrinal development. Without actually coming to the point of making a judgment, one can argue for the congruence of foundational categories with key doctrines such as Trinity, Incarnation, and Church. Many of the questions about the reasonableness of central doctrines are taken up in traditional fundamental theology, but in the form of apologetics and emphasizing credibility. Here, the goal is more modest, to show<br>

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Abstract: As was demonstrated in the last chapter, the parables of Jesus are texts that can be considered from three different perspectives. First, they are historical texts that arose in a particular time and cultural space and that are part of a history of tradition. Second, they are fictional texts that have a typical form and poetic style and that use literary devices. Third, they are texts notably addressed to their recipients, their hearers and readers, in order to evoke a process of thinking and rethinking that ultimately leads to deeper insights and even corresponding (re-)action.

  Abstract: The next sample parable has been taken from the Gospel of John. But are there actually any parables in John? In much of parable scholarship, John is ignored as a source of the parables of Jesus. This may have been due to the close relationship between parable-research and historical Jesus-research. If the goal was to reconstruct the original Jesus wording, the late Fourth Gospel seemed to be worthless with regard to the parables. Many of these presuppositions have been challenged in current New Testament scholarship. This alone justifies a short preliminary comment on the issue with regard to research history<br>

  Book Title: The Homebrewed Christianity Guide to Jesus-Lord, Liar, Lunatic…Or Awesome?<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): FULLER TRIPP<br>
  Abstract: Christology is crazy. It’s rather absurd to identify a first-century homeless Jew as God revealed, but a bunch of us do anyway. In this book, Tripp Fuller examines the historical Jesus, the development of the doctrine of Christ, the questions that drove christological innovations through church history, contemporary constructive proposals, and the predicament of belief for the church today. Recognizing that the battle over Jesus is no longer a public debate between the skeptic and believer but an internal struggle in the heart of many disciples, he argues that we continue to make christological claims about more than an “event" or simply the “Jesus of history." On the other hand, C. S. Lewis’s infamous “liar, lunatic, and Lord" scheme is no longer intellectually tenable. This may be a guide to Jesus, but for Christians, Fuller is guiding us toward a deeper understanding of God. He thinks it’s good news—good news about a God who is so invested in the world that God refuses to be God without us.<br>

  Book Title: The Wisdom and Foolishness of God-First Corinthians 1-2 in Theological Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Askani Hans-Christoph<br>
  Abstract: The first two chapters of Paul’s first epistle to the Christians of Corinth, written in the fifth decade of the first century, have played a significant role in the history of Christian theology. Interpreting the central event in Christianity, namely the crucifixion of Jesus, Paul reflects on the wisdom and foolishness of God, which he opposes to the world’s wisdom. According to Paul, the “word of the cross," which is “foolishness" to some and “scandal" to others, leads to an upheaval in one’s way of thinking. For two millenia, theology has often turned to these passages in order to sustain its reflection. Many central questions emerge from Paul’s text on the meaning of a crucified Messiah, on God’s omnipotence, weakness, and suffering. This volume hopes to achieve two things by seeking to place exegetes, historians, philosophers, and theologians in conversation: to better understand Paul’s text and its reception and also to examine the ways in which it can nourish our theological reflection today.<br>

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

  Abstract: There are moments when the pursuit of history can seem truly unnerving. Sometimes that past which was meant to ground our ideas and conceptions gives way and reveals something stranger, alien and uncanny. Although such episodes are rare events in most historians’ lives, they form a recurring motif in fantastic literature, where they are widely associated with the breakdown of identity and personality. Stories of historians driven to madness and despair when their narratives are confounded recur repeatedly in novels, from Mary Ward’s

  Abstract: The quest for the historical Jesus was not restricted to the universities or the established Churches. Across Britain and the United States, working-class radicals debated the historical basis of the Gospel records. Before George Eliot’s translation of the
                  Leben Jesuappeared, plebeian secularists had issued cheap pirated editions of Strauss’s work. Their turn to historical enquiry was driven by a very different set of motives to those which animated Eliot and her ecclesiastical colleagues.¹ Some, including the Chartist ex-cobbler Thomas Cooper, believed that historical criticism would reveal the ‘legendary incrustations’ that had corrupted the true history of Christ.² Like Strauss<br>

It is apparent that Hill’s poetry has always known history very well indeed. Historical figures and events have featured substantially from the beginning: ‘Knowing the dead, and how some are disposed’ (‘Two Formal Elegies’,
                  For the Unfallen, 1959;CPpp. 30–1). Elegy, Requiem, ‘In Memory’, ‘The Death of’, ‘Ode on the Loss of’, ‘Funeral Music’ appear in titles of the earlier work to announce a compulsion towards commemoration<br>

  Abstract: As Sarah Worth suggests, despite well-established feminist work in literary criticism, film theory and art history, feminist aesthetics ‘is a relatively young discipline, dating from the early 1990s’, and thus still open to contestation and new formulations.¹ In this context it might seem paradoxical that one of the founding texts of feminist aesthetics, Rita Felski’s

Theories of genius, authorial psychology and the material or historical conditions of production have revalued the creative processes that give rise to art in a range of different ways. Equally, important questions about reception that deal with notions of canonicity, ideology and the construction of subjectivities in texts have been generated by critical movements that seek to investigate the politics of literature, art and culture.

This desert sojourner’s conviction that he was raised in a creedal vacuum, without fixed beliefs – a personal history ‘clean of any ideology’ – is optimistic but, as he suspects, not entirely credible.

Healy’s statement regarding the ‘manufactured’ or mediated nature of much of the historical record can be seen to be particularly pertinent to Irish history: ‘History is a construct, often a narrative of interested parties who seek to prove a thesis’ (Healy, 1992: 15).

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

  Book Title: The subject of love-Hélène Cixous and the feminine divine<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Renshaw Sal<br>
  Abstract: *The Subject of Love: Hélène Cixous and the Feminine Divine* is about abundant, generous, other-regarding love. In the history of Western ideas of love, such a configuration has been inseparable from our ideas about divinity and the sacred; often reserved only for God; and rarely thought of as a human achievement. This book is a substantial engagement with her philosophies of love, inviting the reader to reflect on the conditions of subjectivity that just might open us to something like a divine love of the other. Renshaw follows this thread in this genealogy of abundant love: the thread that connects the subject of love from 5th century B.C.E. Greece and Plato, to the 20th century protestant theology of agapic love of Anders Nygren, to the late 20th century poetico-philosophy of Hélène Cixous. This study will be of particular interest to academics and students of the history of gender, cultural studies, criticism and gender studies<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jb3s">The subject of love</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout history theorists and philosophers of love have been preoccupied with the relationship between the subjects and objects of love. From Plato’s reflections on the divinity of a disembodied love of wisdom to the Christian ideal of loving our enemies, there is a recurring concern with understanding the mediating aspects of love. How should we think of the kinds of exchanges that love brings about? Whether thinking about love concerns relations between human beings, or relations between humans and the divine, the very notion of love as developed in Western thought presupposes that something is loved, while someone else, as<br>

  Abstract: As is already well evident even here, in discourses of love the overwhelming presence of the opinions, experiences, and reflections of men is uncontestable. If history is indeed a record of ‘winners’, as feminists have by no means been alone in suggesting, this insight should come as no surprise. The historical record of love is primarily the written trace of a masculine vision of love, and Plato’s Diotima stands as an effulgent exemplar of woman’s place in that record. Diotima is the absent presence of woman, spoken
                  about, but not actually speaking; spoken through, but unable to speak for herself.<br>

This is not an attempt at a history of Britain in Africa; nor am I trying to suggest that the British have always seen themselves as behaving with altruism and selflessness – there are too many examples of naked aggression and calculations of self-interest in the history of Britain’s dealings with Africa to justify such a claim. However, there are key episodes and streams of ideas relating Africa to Britain which were seen as ‘good’ by those involved<br>

It demonstrates how predominant theories of the international or global ‘present’ are affected by temporal assumptions, grounded in western political thought, that fundamentally shape what we can and cannot know about world politics today. The first part of the book traces the philosophical roots of assumptions about time in contemporary political theory. The second part examines contemporary theories of world politics, including liberal and realist International Relations theories and the work of Habermas, Hardt and Negri, Virilio and Agamben. In each case, it is argued, assumptions about political time ensure the identification of the particular temporality of western experience with the political temporality of the world as such and put the theorist in the unsustainable position of holding the key to the direction of world history. In the final chapter, the book draws on postcolonial and feminist thinking, and the philosophical accounts of political time in the work of Derrida and Deleuze, to develop a new ‘untimely’ way of thinking about time in world politics.<br>

  3  Against historicism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jdgf">Time and world politics</a><br>
  Abstract: THIS chapter examines accounts of political time that are premised on the critique of philosophy of history and historicism. We will begin by looking briefly at two thinkers at the end of the nineteenth century who offered alternatives to the conflation of
                  kairosandchronosin historicist and scientific accounts of time, Nietzsche and Bergson. This then sets the scene for exploring ways in which the assumptions and implications of historicism, in particular Marxist versions of historicism, have been challenged by the following thinkers: Arendt, Benjamin, Derrida and Deleuze. The arguments of these thinkers differ, but they all involve rejecting<br>

  Abstract: IN the previous two chapters we have been exploring philosophical accounts of political time. In this and subsequent chapters we examine readings of contemporary world politics and the different ways in which they rely on and reproduce configurations of the relation between

In this chapter our focus is on interpretations of the nature and direction of world politics after the Cold War, including the popular ‘end of history’ and ‘clash of civilisations’ narratives offered by Fukuyama and Huntington, and responses from the social science of International Relations during the 1990s.<br>

  Abstract: IN the previous chapter I argued that ‘scientific’ attempts to diagnose the post-1989 times of world politics, in spite of their explicit rejection of historicism, nevertheless depended on
                  kairoticmeta-narratives of political temporality. The familiar ghost of philosophical history, in which the scholar’s task is both to identify the ‘real’ mechanisms underlying historical development and to intervene, or enable intervention, positively in relation to time – to workwithoragainsttime – continued to be present. One of the reasons why post-Popperian social science ostensibly rejected historicism was because it was argued that historicism was normatively driven and incapable<br>

  Book Title: Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dunworth Felicity<br>
  Abstract: "Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage" is a study of the dramatised mother figure in English drama from the mid-sixteenth to the early seventeenth centuries. It explores a range of genres: moralities, histories, romantic comedies, city comedies, domestic tragedies, high tragedies, romances and melodrama and includes close readings of plays by such diverse dramatists as Udall, Bale, Phillip, Legge, Kyd, Marlowe, Peele, Shakespeare, Middleton, Dekker and Webster. The study is enriched by reference to religious, political and literary discourses of the period, from Reformation and counter-Reformation polemic to midwifery manuals and Mother’s Legacies, the political rhetoric of Mary I, Elizabeth I and James VI, reported gallows confessions of mother convicts and Puritan conduct books. It thus offers scholars of literature, drama, art and history a unique opportunity to consider the literary, visual and rhetorical representation of motherhood in the context of a discussion of familiar and less familiar dramatic texts.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jf16">Mothers and meaning on the early modern English stage</a><br>
  Abstract: Jean Howard and Phyllis Rackin, who have worked so extensively on Shakespeare’s history plays, note that they contain ‘relatively few and often sketchy’ images of women and their comment is applicable to Elizabethan history plays in general.² Those who are represented in such plays, and, indeed, their sources, referred to by A. P. Rossiter as ‘that long line of women broken in the course of great events’, are mostly mothers.³ The typological link between mother and state discussed in previous chapters meant that motherhood developed importance as a trope by which the dramatisation of political conflict acquired validity and complexity.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter will introduce Kosovo and Chechnya as examples of contemporary conflict. Delving into the history and geopolitics of Kosovo and Chechnya will help, insofar as it draws attention to a range of features, as well as a range of similar and dissimilar trends which inscribed the character of violence. These trends and features may be discernible in mythic stories of war and identity. In this way, analysis of geopolitical legacies and historical narratives provides valuable and often neglected insight into both regions.

In both cases the armed resistance movements emerged against the backdrop of the disintegration of the USSR and Socialist Yugoslavia, but the provenance of each movement needs to be located in a broader frame of late nineteenth- and twentieth-century history. The armed resistance movements became involved in low-level conflicts in Kosovo and Chechnya, and more generally in the neighbouring regions and environs.

In doing so, attention has been drawn to different levels of analysis, the role of history in the Caucasus and Balkans, and different social, cultural and local forms of identification. In both Kosovo and Chechnya we see contract soldiers, special police units and federal army units fighting against armed resistance movements.

  Book Title: Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kempshall Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book provides an analytical overview of the vast range of historiography which was produced in western Europe over a thousand-year period between c.400 and c.1500. Concentrating on the general principles of classical rhetoric central to the language of this writing, alongside the more familiar traditions of ancient history, biblical exegesis and patristic theology, this survey introduces the conceptual sophistication and semantic rigour with which medieval authors could approach their narratives of past and present events, and the diversity of ends to which this history could then be put. By providing a close reading of some of the historians who put these linguistic principles and strategies into practice (from Augustine and Orosius through Otto of Freising and William of Malmesbury to Machiavelli and Guicciardini), it traces and questions some of the key methodological changes that characterise the function and purpose of the western historiographical tradition in this formative period of its development.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: What follows has its immediate origins in a series of lectures offered to undergraduate historians at Oxford in the summer of 2004. It should therefore begin with an apology, in the strictest sense of the word, to those of my early-modern and modern colleagues within the History Faculty who thought that an undergraduate paper on the history of historiography should begin in
                  c. 1500 because that is when, and I quote, ‘proper’ historiography really began. Without wishing to be vague, or get into a jam, had those colleagues said that to a classicist, they would have been met with a<br>

  1  HISTORY AND HISTORIOGRAPHY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The writing of history in the Middle Ages cannot be reduced to one single formula or definition. Instead, it straddled a huge variety of genres, covering – and often combining – world chronicles, annals, histories of communities, deeds of individuals, hagiographies, biographies, autobiographies and epic poems.¹ Medieval historiography therefore does not correspond to any fixed genre, in terms of either its form or its style – it could be written in prose, in verse or sometimes as both; it could be sung as a
                  chanson de geste; it could be sculpted or painted or presented in tableaux; in the case of the ‘estorie’<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: In seeking to establish exactly how the writing of history was conceptualised and practised in the Middle Ages, a sensible starting point is to identify where historiography fitted into a programme of study, that is, where medieval authors would themselves have encountered the writing of history as a body of material and as part and parcel of their education.¹ What becomes immediately apparent is that, initially at least, it would have been as an integral component of the study of grammar and rhetoric – in grammar, as excerpts from classical historians and, in rhetoric, as the theory and practice of narrating<br>

  3  INVENTION AND NARRATIVE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The categorisation of classical rhetoric into its demonstrative, judicial and deliberative forms reveals significant differences in emphasis, but also significant similarities in approach, in the way in which the relationship between an individual’s character (
                  mores) and deeds (res gestae) could, and should, be described by a speaker or writer. The principles which these three categories of rhetoric shared as common ground, however, exerted an impact on medieval historiography that went well beyond engineering the specific didactic, legal or political goals of particular works of history. This influence can be gauged by means of the two standard schemes according to which<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: The influence of classical rhetoric on the writing of history in the Middle Ages centred on the relationship between the depiction of character (attributes of person) and the description of deeds (attributes of events), on the invention of arguments (causation, testimony and proof), and on the construction of a brief, lucid and, above all, verisimilar narrative. This does not mean, of course, that all the principles involved in each one of these areas were applied either simultaneously or consistently across the broad range of writings which the single term

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt155jhjx">Rhetoric and the Writing of History, 400-1500</a><br>
  Abstract: Medieval historiography was neither crude nor credulous nor conceptually unsophisticated. Such characterisations would be no more, and no less, applicable to the writing of history in the early modern and modern periods and, if only on this basis, medieval historians deserve better than to suffer the methodological condescension of posterity. The present study has been designed accordingly as an introduction to a set of interpretative criteria on which works of medieval historiography might be assessed, primarily through examining principles of classical rhetoric which would have been second-nature to writers who had been brought up, directly or indirectly, on the precepts<br>

  Author(s) Horton Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: As with many periods in Church history, the position of the “mainstream” Reformation tradition (Lutheran and Reformed) on scripture has often been misunderstood, by friend and foe alike. At least in our North American context,
                  sola scriptura(scripture alone) has come to mean not simply that scripture alone is master over tradition, but that it is somehow antithetical to it.

  Author(s) Prudlo Donald S.<br>
  Abstract: The Counter-Reformation is a period in the history of the Roman Catholic Church during which the Church dealt with issues arising from the emergence of Protestantism. Though Catholic reform predated Martin Luther, nonetheless the challenges that he and other reformers presented led the Church to make serious and sustained changes. The focus of the Counter-Reformation was the Council of Trent (1545–63), an event that left few areas of Catholic life untouched. The Council issued broad dogmatic decrees on the sacraments, the scriptures, justification, and Church government, in addition to passing many ordinances on internal Church reform.

At one level, of course, talk of the postmodern was just a way of indicating the “up to date,” the newer than new. But at a more serious level it indicated something about modern times, about those characteristics of modernity that have become so intense that they<br>

  Abstract: The fate of both Jesus and the temple is—at least in the eyes of some early Christians—clearly consolidated into one large-scale event. John 2:21 says that, when Jesus spoke of the coming destruction of the temple, he was speaking of his own body. Witnesses at his trial accused him of forecasting the end of the temple—which in fact occurred some forty years later. It seems reasonable to conclude that both the cross and the temple ruins after 70 CE were seen as a dual inauguration of a new and final chapter in Israel’s history. True, the accusation<br>

  Abstract: Cairo, representative of many different faces, nationalities, traditions, languages, and cultures, has enjoyed the status of a cosmopolitan city throughout its history. Egypt also has been sought as a place of exile by sizeable refugee populations, including Palestinians after 1948 and Armenians who fled the 1915 massacre under the Ottomans. Traditionally, Palestinians constitute the largest proportion of exiled residents, today numbering between fifty and seventy thousand (el-Abed 2003).¹ In the 1950s and 1960s, Cairo was host to exiles from liberation movements in Africa and the Middle East, mainly small numbers of political activists.<br>

  Abstract: In
         Tropical Apocalypse,Martin Munro argues that since the earliest days of European colonization, Caribbean-and especially Haitian-history has been shaped by apocalyptic events so that the region has, in effect, been living for centuries in an end time without end. By engaging with the contemporary apocalyptic turn in Caribbean studies and lived reality, he not only provides important historical contextualization for a general understanding of apocalypse in the region but also offers an account of the state of Haitian society and culture in the decades before the 2010 earthquake. Inherently interdisciplinary, his work ranges widely through Caribbean and Haitian thought, historiography, political discourse, literature, film, religion, and ecocriticism in its exploration of whether culture in these various forms can shape the future of a country.<br>

  Abstract: There is in Haiti and elsewhere a curious relationship between utopian discourse and apocalyptic outcomes. One might argue that many of the apocalyptic wars of the twentieth century were driven and justified by utopian discourses—Marxism, fascism, religions, and various forms of nationalism. The fall of the Berlin Wall seemed to announce the start of the “happy ’90s,” and gave rise to Francis Fukuyama’s utopian idea of the “end of history,” the belief that “liberal democracy had, in principle, won out, that the advent of a global liberal community was hovering around the corner, and that the obstacles to this<br>

However, the landscape biography is not a hermetic theory, but rather an inspiring metaphor, used as an umbrella for a number of ideas that have changed the ways we look at the history of as well as the actual dealing with landscapes (see the introductory chapter of this volume).

  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly.

  Author(s) JUDAKEN JONATHAN<br>
  Abstract: Léon Poliakov was one of the great historians of the twentieth century. He remains the doyen of critical scholarship on the history of anti-Semitism, a founding father of Holocaust and genocide studies, and a forerunner in the history of racism, stereotyping, persecution, and demonization. Yet the importance of his contributions is not well known to many scholars, let alone a wider public.¹ This chapter focuses on Poliakov’s often unacknowledged contributions to the establishment of Holocaust studies and explores how he understood a key engine in the machinery of the destruction of European Jewry: anti-Semitism.<br>

  Book Title: A Godly Humanism-Clarifying the Hope That Lies Within<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): George Francis Cardinal<br>
  Abstract: For Francis Cardinal George, the Catholic Church is not a movement, built around ideas, but a communion, built around relationships. In A Godly Humanism, he shares his understanding of the Church in lively, compelling prose, presenting a way to understand and appreciate the relationships of God to human beings and of human beings to one another. These loving relationships are continually made present to us in and through the Church, from the time of Jesus' first disciples down to our own day. We are introduced to how the spiritual and intellectual life of Christians, aided in every generation by the Holy Spirit working through the Apostles and their successors, resist the danger of splitting apart from one another. Though they take different outward forms at different times, both wisdom and holiness are made possible for every Christian of every station of life. Sign-posting his conversation by the milestones of his own spiritual and intellectual journey, Cardinal George invites us to view the Church and her history in ways that go beyond the categories of politics - through which we find merely human initiative, contrivance, and adjustment - and rather to see the initiative as God's first and foremost. God is the non-stop giver, we are non-stop recipients of his gifts, and the recent popes, no less than the Father of the Church, have made every effort to make us aware of the graces - that is, of the unearned benefits - that God confers on us as Catholics, as Christians, as believers, and simply as human persons. Pope Francis, he reminds us, contrasts human planning with God's providence, and this book is at once an exposition of that providence and a personal response of gratitude for the way it has operated in one man's life.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t892">Experiencing Scripture</a><br>
  Abstract: In many ways, the Pentateuch (whether an early or late production) is an answer to that question, ‘Who is God?’ It is equally an answer to the question, ‘Who is Israel, who are we?’ Imagery may be more important than history. God is the one who brought our ancestors to Canaan, who brought us out of oppression<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t892">Experiencing Scripture</a><br>
  Abstract: When we move from creation and flood to the figures of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and then Joseph and Moses, we move from the realm of myth to the realm of legend. Legend is a neutral and useful term because it allows for the association of both history and reality. Its description will usually reflect belief about what may be historical although unverifiable. In that sense, the traditions about certain biblical figures have often been regarded as historically reliable; they have also often been regarded as unverifiable. Legend occupies a middle ground somewhere between fiction and attestable reality. It does not<br>

  Abstract: Historically the four encounters which have taken place between Christianity and Chinese culture, present a dramatic history! Today Christians in China still suffer the negative consequences of the failures of the past. However, in the past twenty-five years, the Chinese people have shown an increasing interest in Christianity, in ways nev er before experienced. Will this fifth encounter between Christianity and modern China succeed? While we can only speculate, it is very clear after so many failures, that the encounter will not succeed if the church turns back on the road of confrontation. Only by persevering in dialogue<br>

  Author(s) Winter Sean F<br>
  Abstract: This article surveys Bonhoeffer’s early education in biblical studies, with a focus on his different encounters with Adolf Schlatter and Karl Barth. I propose that Bonhoeffer’s understanding of the tools of the historical-critical method in relation to a theologically focussed form of biblical interpretation was formed in this initial period, and that the relationship between history and revelation that he landed upon was not antithetical but complementary. Historical criticism was the servant of interpreting the Bible as revealed Scripture, but it was nevertheless an essential aspect of the interpretative process. The idea that ‘Bonhoeffer’s use of the Bible is the<br>

  Abstract: In October 2006, the then Australian Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd wrote an article for

Rudd, who at the time was spruiking his credentials for the prime ministership through various social media and popular television shows like Channel 7’ sSunrise, wrote that Bonhoeffer was ‘without doubt the man I admire most in the history of the twentieth century’.¹ While Rudd’s own Christian faith was no secret, this was surely a strange and risky identification to make for someone who was seeking the highest office in<br>

  Abstract: ‘Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s.’ We all know the saying but history tells us how ambiguous it is. Like it or not, we all inhabit the City of Man. The cross, however, insists on the tension, sometimes an apparent antagonism, which exists between it and the reign of God. Bonhoeffer was profoundly aware of it: ‘God lets himself be pushed out of the world on to the cross’, he wrote, going on to argue therefore that ‘we cannot be honest unless we recognize that we have to live in<br>

  Abstract: Among the many challenging developments that emerged from the Second Vatican Council, the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation,
                  Dei Verbum(henceforthDV), one of the last documents to be promulgated by Paul VI at the close of the Council on 18 November 1965, has an important place. The document is the result of a tortured history that ran across all sittings of the Council.

  Author(s) Murphy-O’Connor Jerome<br>
  Abstract: The more conciliar documents of bygone years are studied, the extent to which they were conditioned by historical circumstances becomes more and more evident. It is important, therefore, to first situate

Then I shall examine what exactlyDVsaid about the New Testament, and conclude with an assessment of the impact of this document on the Church.

  Abstract: It is always dangerous to draw too precise parallels between one historical period and another; and among the most leading of such parallels are those which have been drawn between our own age and Europe and North America and the epoch in which the Roman Empire declined into the dark ages. Nonetheless certain parallels there are. A crucial turning point in that earlier history occurred when men and women of good will turned aside from the task of shoring up the

  Book Title: Opening the Bible-Selected Writings of Antony Campbell SJ<br>
  Publisher: ATF Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Antony<br>
  Abstract: "When Tony Campbell, aged 75, asked the Council of Jesuit Theological College for Emeritus status and retirement from JTC, both were granted most graciously, along with a testimonial document which said in part: ‘His teaching has combined evocation and provocation in the best sense of those terms. He has mentored research students with scholarly exactitude and personal care. He has published books of the highest scholarly quality, of engaging readability, and of passionate conviction.’ When we at ATF were considering asking him for a volume of Collected Works or Selected Writings, we were well aware that ‘published books of the highest scholarly quality’ were likely to be found on the shelves of libraries and of specialised academics, but not with students and others generally interested. There may be a dozen or more of Tony’s books on the list from Amazon.com booksellers, along with another two or three that are not listed there. But most are heavy-duty specialist works, not easily accessible even to the educated public. We were equally well aware that there was a surprising number of essays and articles scattered in journals and proceedings of conferences that were, because of the scattering, often just as inaccessible. We thought that a collection of these in a single volume would be of great value to those interested. In the Introduction to this volume, Father Campbell has gone into some detail about the contents. Suffice for us to say that Job and the issues associated with suffering concern us all, that the interplay of history and narrative is a constant in the understanding of much biblical text, and that the nature of the Bible and its role in our lives is a major concern for most thinking Christians. While Father Campbell’s focus is on the Older Testament, pondering what he looks at throws light on much of the Newer Testament as well. The writings Tony Campbell has pulled together in this single volume address significant issues within the readable length of an article or a talk. Addressed originally to thinking people, we at ATF believe they are likely to be of interest to a wide audience."<br>

  Abstract: The collection constituted by these four chapters (2 Samuel 21–24) offers a particular contribution to our understanding of the conference theme: Story or History in the book of Samuel. The issue of story or history, of story or report, is form-critically extremely challenging and theologically extremely important. As any reader of Mark O’Brien and my recent

  Abstract: Before we examine the emergence of what is now called form criticism (German:
                     Formgeschichte;‘criticism’ in English and ‘history’ in German—not an insignificant difference), a preliminary observation may be important. As a general rule, reflection on movements in human awareness (correlatively, religious awareness) is usually more appropriate a century or two after the movements have ended rather than a mere century or so after they have begun. In the present case, however, it may be necessary to hazard some preliminary thoughts related to moves in the world of Older Testament study over the last century or so.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt163t9t9">Opening the Bible</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘Growth-of-text’ is certainly not flavor-of-the-month at the moment in exegetical circles. This article hews close to the contours of the present text, not attempting to go any further back into the history of the text than the pre–dtr level represented by Joshua 2. Joshua 1 provides the introduction to the deuteronomistic text of the book of Joshua.¹ It is a possibility worth considering that Joshua 2 provides the introduction to an earlier narrative version, with a significantly different presentation of the traditions. Identification of this possible narrative raises issues around the development of a theology of extermination.<br>

  Abstract: The shock of World War I contributed to a crisis of reason and loss of confidence in the humanist foundations for modern secular utopianism.¹ For some, the ideal of material progress became synonymous with the creation of more efficient weapons of mass destruction. And for many artists, romantic yearnings to express the imagination were channeled toward a growing aestheticization of violence.² One of the consequences of this crisis in European culture was the renewal of interest among Jewish and Christian intellectuals in the history of apocalyptic and messianic hopes.³ According to Gershom Scholem, an interest in the messianic has always<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1657v0t">Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama</a><br>
  Abstract: Within the history of modern Jewish redemptive narratives, Bloch played a central role in translating what he interpreted as the subversive metahistory within religion into the praxis of horizontal solidarity and revolutionary agitation. Ernst Bloch’s great innovation was to infuse secular Marxist materialism with quasi-Kabbalistic mysticism and a metaphysics of contingency. This chapter is an exposition of those features within Bloch’s writings that contributed to the post–World War II creation of a “school of hope” among theologians and critical theorists. Later theologians—both Jewish and Christian—were drawn to Bloch’s analysis because he also insisted that Marxism had missed<br>

It appears we must say much the same for war as a permanent factor in the history of man and for the transcultural presence of vendetta in archaic societies.

Even though Eve has an important role in the Edenic scene of sin that establishes humanity as a mortal species, the homicidal and fratricidal act that initiates human history provides for no woman.

  Abstract: The present collection is the fruit of an inquiry that began in the early 1990s and that sought to better elucidate certain aspects of France’s contemporary history. The weight of colonial imaginary, discernible in the production of a colonial iconicity, in colonial cinema, and in the intertextual articulations of images/discourse, called for improved contextualization, as did those mechanisms associated with the construction of different paradigms with respect to the Other in the context of a burgeoning imperialism.¹ Initial research was conducted on the subject of “human zoos,” and then shortly thereafter we began evaluating the importance of colonial expositions and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gh82z">Colonial Culture in France since the Revolution</a><br>
  Author(s) Bancel Nicolas<br>
  Abstract: During the twenty-year period between the second abolition of 1848 and the Third republic’s colonial saga, Napoleon III headed France’s imperial policy. History, however, does not recall this period in terms of its great ultramarine
                  destiny,or because of its leader’s successful or unsuccessful attempts at conquest. nevertheless, two events stand out as exceptions: the myth of the “Arab Kingdom” and the fiasco that was the Mexican Expedition. From the outset, it might appear that the second empire would not fit into the present topic of analysis, as it is often seen as but a “parenthesis” to French colonial history.<br>

Though this novel and much criticized—by the right and the extreme right, as well as by some on the left, and almost the entirety of immigration “specialists”—phenomenon is rarely associated with colonial history, it is, in fact, as much a part of the colonial as it is the history of immigration.

  Abstract: Understanding the role of the Indochina War in the history of French society from the second half of the twentieth century, and the fracture it caused to the cultural universe of what we used to call the “metropole,” is not a simple task.

  Abstract: Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed. Another reason for anti-Algerian sentiment was the fact that this labor immigration was organized<br>

Far from constituting a rupture, the independence of the vast majority of sub-S aharan French territories to arise with the emergence of the Fifth Republic (including the mandated territories of Togo and Cameroon, which went to France after the First World War), was instead the beginning of a new relationship, a new history between France and the African continent.

The army was on the front lines of these events. The whole army. Not just a group of specialized troops. In Algeria, the first units to disembark in 1830 belonged to troops that would later be called “metropolitans.” The state’s will under the Third Republic to associate the nation with conquest explains the decision to send draftees to Madagascar in 1895.

The refusal to think about death, and specifically its association with sadness and pain for those left behind, is a constant theme in the history of philosophy. The image of Socrates presented inPhaedo,happy to accept his own death, is emblematic of the philosopher who has learned how to die. Xanthippe, his wife, is expelled from this scene in which philosophy and<br>

  Author(s) Houston Christopher<br>
  Abstract: What is phenomenology? And why should anthropologists, as well as students of history, psychology, education, or political economy be interested in it? Within philosophy, phenomenology is as diverse as its practitioners. Indeed, Moran (2000: 3) in an introduction to philosophical traditions of phenomenology finds it important to warn readers not to overstate the degree to which phenomenology “coheres into an agreed method, or accepts one theoretical outlook, or one set of philosophical theses about consciousness, knowledge, and the world.” Some of this diversity continues to be a feature of anthropological uses of phenomenology, as we show here. Yet we also<br>

  Author(s) Van Heekeren Deborah<br>
  Abstract: I have long admired Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s writing on Paul Cézanne because it provides insight into the artist’s practice beyond the general conventions of art history. The philosopher saw the painter as a paradigm example of the essence of perception.¹ As he writes, “Cézanne did not think he had to choose between feeling and thought, between order and chaos. He did not want to separate the stable things which we see and the shifting way in which they appear; he wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through spontaneous organization” (Merleau-Ponty 1964 [1945]: 13).<br>

  Author(s) Houston Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Fiction is a genre that tells the stories of characters whose lives are parasitic upon yet identical to none of those 15 million people. Unlike macro-social science with its illuminating focus on political economic structures that mediate personal history and condition social experience, potentially making the stories of 15 million people variations on a theme, fiction gives attentive value to the particular, the quixotic, and the perverse. Characters’ lives and experiences are different from each other yet interlocked in strange and fateful ways. Nevertheless, in fiction, too, authors work with a presumption of resemblance, even as it is shown not<br>

                  Gegenstand, so frequently used by Wittgenstein in theTractatus Logico-Philosophicus, and that word’s Latinate predecessor “object” bring with them the notion of something that is over against or cast in front and so stands in the way. A further complexity arises for us today from the fact that when the Scholastics, followed by Descartes and others, speak of the objective reality of an idea as distinct from its formal reality, objective means<br>

  Abstract: One of the most unusual chapters in the history of the Walt Disney studio began in 1941, when Disney was approached by the United States government to make a goodwill tour of South America. The United States had not officially entered World War II at that time, but the government noted with some concern a growing Nazi influence in South America and was seeking to counter that influence by promoting friendly ties between the Americas. Disney did make the trip, along with a group of his artists, and thus began a chain of events which eventually produced two feature-length pictures,<br>

  Abstract: The importance of the question of understanding in the aesthetic realm requires a redefinition of hermeneutics, or a critical reconstruction of its history, which in the end amounts to its actual construction. It is not an exaggeration to say that hermeneutics, in a certain sense, was
                  constructedin the middle of the 1950s. Those are the years in which, while Heidegger inquires into the meaning of the word “hermeneutics” in his famous essay “A Dialogue on Language,” from 1953–54, Gadamer is working on his project of a philosophical hermeneutics.¹ The discipline, which only from the seventeenth century on is<br>

This argument is in no sense demonstrative, as the term is commonly understood, and there is nothing representational about the presentation, which opens the way to the essence of what Nietzsche would have only incompletely thought: nihilism, as the “covert basic law of Western history.”² What, then, does it mean to interpret?

  Abstract: Philosophy and Western culture have been synonymous at least since Hegel’s philosophy of history. Even when philosophy has been ignored, degraded, reappropriated, or put into question and even when philosophers have sought to “destroy” it, philosophy has been taken as a given inseparable from Western culture and born of it. Practically speaking, no one from the West or educated under the Western tradition, no matter how critical of it, would put into question the existence of European, French, German, or Italian philosophy.

  Abstract: Hegel is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood thinkers in Western intellectual history, a history he claimed to sum up and bring to its maturity. This misunderstanding has several roots. One is the intrinsic difficulty of grasping Hegel’s thought. It is dense, technical, dialectical, and arranged in such a way that, to understand anything in it, one has to understanding its linkage with the whole system of thought. This means that one could easily take any given statement out of context and find in it a meaning that on the surface sounds preposterous.<br>

  Abstract: In a polemic typically aimed at Hegelians and in the name of religious piety, Kierkegaard complained that philosophers construct magnificent thought-castles and dwell in miserable shacks nearby. Dwelling is a matter of deepest individuality, of subjectivity, passion, and inwardness.¹ It is a matter of the heart, of which Pascal says that reason knows nothing.² And everyone knows that the individual with his precious heart is swallowed up in Hegelian panlogicism and ground under in the march of the Absolute through history.<br>

  “We Beheld His Glory!” (John 1:14) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Keener Craig S.<br>
  Abstract: Most scholars today concur that the Fourth Gospel includes both history and theology. Even many patristic interpreters, who often harmonized John with the Synoptics (hence apparently stressing history), recognized John as a “spiritual” Gospel, emphasizing its interpretive aspects. The Gospel clearly interprets theologically the eyewitness claim that apparently stands behind it (cf. 21:24); perhaps most conspicuously, in the Fourth Gospel as a whole the eyewitness claim of water and blood from Jesus’ side (19:34–35) is made to climax a motif of water running through the narrative (1:26, 33; 2:7 – 9; 3:5, 23; 4:10, 13 – 14; 5:2; 7:37 – 39; 9:7;<br>

  Author(s) McGrath James F.<br>
  Abstract: The material found in John 2:13–22, depicting Jesus’ action in the temple and the saying about its being destroyed and rebuilt in three days, is a key point of intersection between the Gospel of John, the Synoptics, and the Gospel of Thomas. As such, it provides one of the relatively few places where questions of John, Jesus, and history can be discussed, as it were, “synoptically.” Because of this multiple attestation, there are very few scholars who dispute that Jesus engaged in

  Author(s) Coloe Mary<br>
  Abstract: The Fourth Gospel is the most historical of all the Gospels. While it has been entitled “the spiritual Gospel,” its depth of spiritual insight does not in any way detract from its focus on the actual life and death of Jesus of Nazareth.¹ In fact, this Gospel proclaims that history is now the locus of the divine presence. In the flesh of Jesus, we have the eternal Word of God. For this reason, history is now radiant with the glory of God: “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16ptndz">John, Jesus, and History, Volume 2</a><br>
  Author(s) Charlesworth James H.<br>
  Abstract: Over the past two decades, specialists on the Gospel of John have customarily focused on the translation, composition-history, and exegesis of this masterpiece. Less attention is addressed to the symbolic world of the Evangelist. That dimension of Johannine studies is now much clearer, thanks to archaeological research and the study of symbolism (see Charlesworth 2006 and 2008), otherwise known as symbology. The present work will illustrate this emerging clarity by exploring the deeper and fuller meaning of an incredibly rich and well-known section of the Fourth Gospel: John 3:13–17.<br>

  Abstract: Prodigious are the questions generated by this passage (John 13:1–20), and only slightly less prodigious are the publications devoted to it. Textual, anthropological, theological, literary, and exegetical analyses abound; only the historical remains largely untouched. When the historical is mentioned, however, treatments most often refer to the history of the Johannine situation,
                  notto the historical Jesus or the historicity of the underlying Johannine tradition. Of all the questions one could ask, we shall attend most closely in this essay to these two. (1) Is it historically plausible that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples? Why or why<br>

  Author(s) Matson Mark A.<br>
  Abstract: The question of the historical value of material in the Fourth Gospel rests on two concerns that always lurk behind the discussions in the SBL group focusing on John, Jesus, and history. The first is the foundational question of how we evaluate the Gospels, or really any ancient writing, for “historical” material. That is, we must deal with the always-contentious issue of the criteria we use to determine Gospel materials’ historical value.¹ The second question is how we account for the stark differences between John and the Synoptics.² One cannot venture far into any consideration of John’s historical value without<br>

  Abstract: In

In this essay, I propose to look at its function in providing closure for the Gospel. The focus of this paper was prompted in particular by Howard M.

  Author(s) Anderson Paul N.<br>
  Abstract: In reflecting upon the above treatments of aspects of historicity in the Fourth Gospel, a multiplicity of approaches and disciplines is here employed in getting at a common interest: the historical character of the Johannine tradition and ways in which it casts light upon the Jesus of history—his intentions, doings, teachings, travels, and receptions, as well as impressions, memories, interpretations, narrations, and writings about him in later settings. The division of the Gospel of John into three sections involving chapters 1–4, 5–12, and 13–21 works well as a means of dividing up the ministry of Jesus<br>

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  Abstract: When looking at the relationships between democracy, culture, and Catholicism within the Lithuanian context, what immediately comes to the fore are interactions characterized by trauma, distrust, and tragedy. The origins of this bleak picture can be traced back to Lithuania’s history, to the decades this nation and its people spent alternating under the rule of Soviet, Nazi, and (again) Soviet occupation. The themes of trauma and distrust come out clearly in the chapters included in this section.

  Author(s) Šimkunas Vidmantas<br>
  Abstract: One way to understand the Roman Catholic Church in Lithuania during the period of Soviet oppression is through a historical-theological lens. This approach begins with the position, restated in the Second Vatican Council document
                     Lumen Gentium, that the Church is not just a social institution but also “a kind of sacrament or sign of intimate union with God, and of the unity of all humankind.” Because the Church lives this sacramentality in history, a full interpretation of that life must be sensitive to both the historical and the theological dimensions of its existence.<br>

  Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to offer a brief overview of the relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the Peruvian state in the modern era. This will include a discussion of church-state relations prior to the Second Vatican Council of the Roman Catholic Church (1962–1965) and an analysis of two key periods during and after the Council: 1958–1977 and 1978–1980.

This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

  Abstract: Video games today are often played largely for personal use on smartphones, but if we look at the history of gaming, we see that people played games very differently, in arcades—amusement centers that were once a staple of every city. These arcades date back to the coin-operated Edison parlors that first emerged in the United States during the 1890s. In these amusement centers, customers would insert coins into machines for music and visual entertainment.<br>

  Author(s) Golding Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Australia has experienced a relatively long history of local game development, which in recent years has been quite turbulent, but not without promise from emerging models of game development. For many years, Australia also experienced a unique—and arbitrary, possibly draconian—system of digital game classification, which has only recently been changed to measures that are more similar to those found in other Western democracies. It is for these two issues that Australia is primarily known in digital gaming circles. It may therefore appear somewhat paradoxical that a country with high-tech innovative studios—such as

  Abstract: In Brazil, the history of video games began in the 1980s when the first video game appeared on store shelves. According to Chiado (2011, 26), the first Atari VCS (1977), “half mounted and half manufactured in Sao Paulo,” reached stores in April 1980. Joseph Maghrabi, a 1980s entrepreneur, was instrumental in bringing video games to Brazil and created Channel 3, a pioneering club that manufactured game cartridges. As Maghrabi stated in an interview, “Before creating Channel 3, I founded the Atari Electronics Company. It was for the importing of devices and accessories of the Atari console.

  Author(s) Parra Luis<br>
  Abstract: The history of video games in Colombia begins in the 1980s and 1990s, when a group of enthusiastic young people, motivated by classics like the Mario Bros. franchise, started programming short game experiences, recreating games like Tejo, a traditional sport in Colombia. Later on, they would write games using Symbian and Java for the mobile game market. Colombians have had access to the latest games and consoles almost as they appeared in the US market, giving the young enthusiasts the right motivation and role models to push their efforts. These young developers later became the pioneers of an entertainment industry<br>

  Abstract: Consideration of the history of video games in France prompts the historian to wonder about the French history of video games and the history of French video games. These two histories cross paths but proceed from different dynamics: on the one hand, around the start of the 1970s, the arrival in France of a new form of entertainment and the development of a globalized industrial, economic, and cultural sector; on the other hand, the emergence of national structures (production studios, editors, a specialized press, and cultural institutions such as museums and libraries) that—dedicating themselves to the creation of video<br>

  Abstract: In describing the computer gaming culture in Germany, one must deal factually with two different countries at least until 1990, when the GDR and FRG were united.¹ This is not an uninteresting chapter in Germany’s history; while computer games and video games were unavailable to most people in East Germany, in West Germany, as in all industrialized countries, games were quickly developing into a popular medium. This makes it possible to compare the development of computer games in two entirely different systems, which differ both socially and politically, yet have a common history and culture.

  Abstract: Although video game play has long been an important part of popular culture in Ireland, video games were never treated seriously by the Irish government or Irish society in the past, which is demonstrated by the enormous lack of information on the early history of video games in the country; the Irish government and media never recognized the potential until recently when global video game companies began to develop operations in Ireland.

Given the lack of previously published information, this will be an exploration of the word-of-mouth side of this story. We will explore the retail industry, game journalism, and game development; there is little to no written record of Mexico’s video game history, so this chapter is based on interviews with a few key players in the industry.

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the history of video games in New Zealand during the “long” 1980s. Beginning in the late 1970s and extending well into the 1980s, New Zealand had a booming digital games industry across the spectrum of arcade, console, handheld, and microcomputer games. This is a largely unknown history. Apart from my own research on this topic, written accounts have largely been compiled by private collectors, who continue to deepen understanding of the specificities of particular games software and hardware (Davidson n.d.; Lord n.d.; “SegaSC-3000 Survivors” n.d.; Stephen 2012).

  Abstract: The adoption and expansion of video games in Peru has been relatively slow, mainly due to the hard economic situation the country was going through during much of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Video game history in Peru basically starts with the introduction of arcade machines during the beginning of the 1980s. At that time, a small number of businesses appeared, ranging from medium-sized arcade game centers, which deployed tens of machines, to small stores that had just a handful of them. The majority of arcade machines was provided by Japanese manufacturers such as Namco, Konami,<br>

  Abstract: The history of video games in Russia goes back to the early 1980s. In the beginning of the computer era, Soviet arcade games, very primitive compared to today’s standard, included a large number of slot machines or electromechanical arcade games such as
                  Morskoi Boi(Sea Battle, 1981),Tankodrom(1981),Rally-M(1981),Sniper(1981), andSafari(1982). InSea Battle, the player had to shell enemy ships, whileRally-Mwas a racing game, and inSniper, the player had to shell the target (seehttp://www.15kop.ru/en/).

It first traces the political and social factors that led to the birth of Asia’s online game industry. It then examines the history of video gaming in South Korea since the 1970s, highlighting the types of video games and processes of production and consumption that developed during particular stages of the industry’s growth. This provides an opportunity to document foreign game imports and analyze their influence on South Korea’s domestic industry, particularly the country’s development as a cultural exporter between 2002 and 2012.

  Abstract: Let us begin with a cliché: just like Spain has been considered, historically and aesthetically, a place of and for contrasts, full of cultural crossbreeding, the history of Spanish video games is one of imbalances, changing from mystified golden ages to looping crises and—maybe too—great expectations.

Thai players engage console games, computer games, online games, and handheld games, and many organizations and companies are involved in video games in Thailand, yet there are few studies on the subject. Therefore, this chapter will describe the history of video games, the current situation of video games, and explain the behavior of video game players in Thailand.

  Abstract: Ainadamar(“Fountain of Tears,” 2003–05), an opera composed by Osvaldo Golijov in collaboration with librettist David Henry Hwang and director Peter Sellars, initiates the audience into an atmosphere of a bygone era in Spanish history. Over a low electronic drone, murmuring sounds of water are heard, accompanied by a solemn trumpet fanfare that reverberates in the background. Soon, electronic sounds of a galloping horse fill the hall and merge with boisterous rhythms of castanets and cajones (Peruvian drums) played live on stage. When the trumpet fanfare returns, the overture segues to a plaintive ballad sung by the female chorus<br>

The lengthy proportion of the second act of

  Abstract: Mass spectator sport is a prominent feature of modern social and cultural life. Since the late nineteenth century it has provided a mechanism for the creation of powerful and enduring group identities, focussed on neighbourhood and municipality, region and nation, empire and race. Equally importantly, sport has been a means of socializing individuals into what it means to be men and women in a particular society at a particular juncture in history. This potent conjunction of gender, nationality and race makes a study of the relationship between ethnic minorities and sport a particularly rewarding one, because the formation of group<br>

  Abstract: Recent years have seen the rise of widespread interest in cultural and collective memory and their relation to history, power, voice, identity and representation. This interest is shared by family, local and academic history, museums and community projects and increasingly groups that perceive themselves as marginal to mainstream national and public history. The authors of this chapter have over twenty-five years of experience working with people’s history and community memories. These are areas that we will argue are particularly important in multi-ethnic societies like Wales where they are tied to issues of roots, identity and belonging.<br>

  Book Title: Time-A Vocabulary of the Present<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Elias Amy J.<br>
  Abstract: Featuring twenty essays that reveal what we talk about when we talk about time today, especially in the areas of history, measurement, and culture, each essay pairs two keywords to explore the tension and nuances between them, from "past/future" and "anticipation/unexpected" to "extinction/adaptation" and "serial/simultaneous." Moving beyond the truisms of postmodernism, the collection newly theorizes the meanings of temporality in relationship to aesthetic, cultural, technological, and economic developments in the postwar period. This book thus assumes that time-not space, as the postmoderns had it-is central to the contemporary period, and that through it we can come to terms with what contemporaneity can be for human beings caught up in the historical present. In the end,
      Timereveals that the present is a cultural matrix in which overlapping temporalities condition and compete for our attention. Thus each pair of terms presents two temporalities, yielding a generative account of the time, or times, in which we live.<br>

This presentism has been attributed to a traumatized Western collective consciousness confronting WWII as an “event” unprecedented in its history; to the time of the Spectacle that reduces the past to advertising slogans and depoliticized images of material desire; to finance capitalism’s acceleration of time and eradication of spatial distance as it creates a technologized world economy; or to the speed of “real time” technology that makes impossible both deliberation and historical depth.

The same is true of its twin, innovation, the precursor of which is invention.¹ Innovation and obsolescence, at their most general, refer to twinned processes of technological change that play out across most periods of human history. We typically think of these twins as a smoothly forward-moving sequence of technical advances that have improved functionality and efficiency (innovation), displacing and depreciating the use-value of that which came before with the improvements that they create (obsolescence).

  Book Title: Critical Trauma Studies-Understanding Violence, Conflict and Memory in Everyday Life<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Wertheimer Eric<br>
  Abstract: Trauma is a universal human experience. While each person responds differently to trauma, its presence in our lives nonetheless marks a continual thread through human history and prehistory. In
      Critical Trauma Studies, a diverse group of writers, activists, and scholars of sociology, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies reflects on the study of trauma and how multidisciplinary approaches lend richness and a sense of deeper understanding to this burgeoning field of inquiry. The original essays within this collection cover topics such as female suicide bombers from the Chechen Republic, singing prisoners in Iranian prison camps, sexual assault and survivor advocacy, and families facing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. As it proceeds,Critical Trauma Studiesnever loses sight of the way those who study trauma as an academic field, and those who experience, narrate, and remediate trauma as a personal and embodied event, inform one another. Theoretically adventurous and deeply particular, this book aims to advance trauma studies as a discipline that transcends intellectual boundaries, to be mapped but also to be unmoored from conceptual and practical imperatives. Remaining embedded in lived experiences and material realities,Critical Trauma Studiesframes the field as both richly unbounded and yet clearly defined, historical, and evidence-based.<br>

  Abstract: As a temporal disruption, trauma dislocates individuals from the integrated, narrative context of personal memory and collective history.¹ Thrust into the role of survivor, trauma victims often fail to understand and navigate their new position, since trauma initially exists as an absence in the mind.² Following the initial failure to remember, trauma comes to be situated on the margins of consciousness—implicit memory and dreams—as the brain takes on the work of comprehension and meaning making that cannot yet be faced when cognizant.³ Those who emerge into trauma’s

  Book Title: Religion Without Redemption-Social Contradictions and Awakened Dreams in Latin America<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Löwy Michael<br>
  Abstract: The world’s eyes are on Latin America as a place of radical political inspiration and as an alternative to the neoliberal model. Each country in the region deals differently in its method of government, yet there are common cultural themes that tie the continent’s trajectory together. Religion without Redemption looks at the sociology of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas of the continent, in an attempt to show how Western understanding fails to come close to a correct analysis of how and why political and economic characteristics work as they do. Luis Martínez Andrade focuses on how the centrality of religion for the people of Latin America has influenced how they interact with the changes in the modern economic system. Capitalism, for example, has taken on religious characteristics: it has sacred places of worship (the shopping mall) as well as its own prophets. Martínez Andrade discusses how this form of ‘cultural religion’ accompanies many aspects of life in a contradictory manner: not only does it fulfil the role of legitimating oppression, it also can be a powerful source of rebellion, unveiling thus a subversive side to the status quo. Religion Without Redemption advances the ideas of liberation theory into the 21st century, and challenges the provincialism to which many Latin American thinkers are usually consigned.<br>

  Abstract: Like the other social sciences, anthropology has fairly recent origins. It developed as an academic discipline during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, but it has important forerunners in earlier historiography, geography, travel writing, philosophy, comparative linguistics and jurisprudence. There are many ways of writing the history of anthropology, just as there may exist, in any given society, competing versions of national history or origin myths, promoted by groups or individuals with diverging interests. History is not primarily a product of the past itself, but is rather shaped by the concerns of the present. As these concerns change, past<br>

  Abstract: This book is an exploration of sociological and psycho-social theories of the construction of whiteness vis-à-vis perceptions and imaginings of otherness. It has three main aims. First, to introduce the reader to the history and theoretical unfolding of contemporary studies of whiteness in North America and Europe. Second, to explore the structural facilitating factors of these constructions, through such institutions as the state and the media. Finally, the book synthesises a psycho-social perspective to look at the underlying mechanisms which fuel social exclusion and inclusion in society. Theory is never separated from practice and the book makes full use of<br>

  Abstract: ‘Whiteness studies’ in the USA is a broad, nebulous and multidisciplinary field whose development has provoked a good deal of debate, since the early 1990s, on issues such as epistemology, reinterpretations of American history, and the ways in which dominant identities are constructed. In this chapter we provide an outline of the key areas of debate and the principal ways in which whiteness has been conceptualised.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p383">White Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Book Title: Fredrik Barth-An Intellectual Biography<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: Fredrik Barth is one of the towering figures of twentieth-century anthropology. This intellectual history traces the development of Barth’s ideas and explores the substance of his contributions. In an accessible style, Thomas Eriksen’s biographical study reveals the magic of ethnography to professional anthropologists and non-practitioners alike. Exploring his six decade career, it follows Barth from early ecological studies in Pakistan, to political studies in Iran, to groundbreaking fieldwork in Norway, New Guinea, Bali and Bhutan. Eriksen argues that Barth's voracious appetite for fieldwork holds the key to understanding his remarkable intellectual development and the insights it produced. The book raises many of the same questions that emerge from Barth's own work - of unity and diversity, of culture and relativism, of art and science. Thomas Eriksen is himself a major contributor to the study of anthropology, as well as a distinguished educator, and is therefore ideally placed to introduce the life and work of Fredrik Barth. This will surely be the definitive book on its subject for many years to come.<br>

  Abstract: Trends and fashions come and go in the social sciences, but rarely without leaving something useful behind. From Foucault, we have kept concepts about discourse, power and regimes of knowledge; from Bourdieu, habitus, doxa and forms of capital; from Marxism, a sustained critical interest in power and economics; and from structuralism, the acknowledgement that the human mind functions in a particular way, frequently by way of contrasts. Nonetheless, structuralism, in its original form, is all but forgotten today. Few take up the cues left by 1960s and 1970s Marxism. Neither ethnoscience nor ethnomethodology are read as anything but intellectual history<br>

  Book Title: Mexico in Verse-A History of Music, Rhyme, and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): BEEZLEY WILLIAM H.<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mexico is spoken in the voice of ordinary people. In rhymed verse and mariachi song, in letters of romance and whispered words in the cantina, the heart and soul of a nation is revealed in all its intimacy and authenticity.
      Mexico in Verse, edited by Stephen Neufeld and Michael Matthews, examines Mexican history through its poetry and music, the spoken and the written word.Focusing on modern Mexico, from 1840 to the 1980s, this volume examines the cultural venues in which people articulated their understanding of the social, political, and economic change they witnessed taking place during times of tremendous upheaval, such as the Mexican-American War, the Porfiriato, and the Mexican Revolution. The words of diverse peoples-people of the street, of the field, of the cantinas-reveal the development of the modern nation. Neufeld and Matthews have chosen sources so far unexplored by Mexicanist scholars in order to investigate the ways that individuals interpreted-whether resisting or reinforcing-official narratives about formative historical moments.The contributors offer new research that reveals how different social groups interpreted and understood the Mexican experience. The collected essays cover a wide range of topics: military life, railroad accidents, religious upheaval, children's literature, alcohol consumption, and the 1985 earthquake. Each chapter provides a translated song or poem that encourages readers to participate in the interpretive practice of historical research and cultural scholarship. In this regard,Mexico in Verseserves both as a volume of collected essays and as a classroom-ready primary document reader.<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  Book Title: The People beside Paul-The Philippian Assembly and History from Below<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchal Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together an international and interdisciplinary group of scholars with a broad range of expertise and a common interest: Philippi in antiquity. Each essay engages one set of contextual particularities for Paul and the ordinary people of the Philippian assembly, while simultaneously placing them in wider settings. This 'people's history' uses both traditional and more cutting-edge methods to reconsider archaeology and architecture, economy and ethnicity, prisons and priestesses, slavery, syncretism, stereotypes of Jews, the colony of Philippi, and a range of communities. The contributors are Valerie Abrahamsen, Richard S. Ascough, Robert L. Brawley, Noelle Damico, Richard A. Horsley, Joseph A. Marchal, Mark D.

  Author(s) Abrahamsen Valerie<br>
  Abstract: A people’s history of Philippi must, of necessity, include an examination of women. Recent work on Philippi, the region of Macedonia, sociological contexts, and related topics has greatly expanded our knowledge of women in antiquity, their status in the culture, their independence (or lack thereof), their family connections, their contributions, and their limitations. Examination of women at Philippi in the first centuries of the Roman Empire can expand our knowledge of the “people beside Paul.”<br>

  Abstract: The foregoing essays by Valerie Abrahamsen, Peter Oakes, and Eduard Verhoef raise important issues for a project that takes seriously a history from below that does not privilege elite writings and considers carefully the cultural situation at Philippi. All three of the essays focus to some degree on the socioeconomic and religious context of the early Christadherents. Although a full excavation of the site of ancient Philippi is far from complete, the authors use the extant material remains at the site and, by analogy, from elsewhere to construct the social situation of the Philippian Christ-adherents in the first few centuries.<br>

  Abstract: Recent efforts to revisit the interpretation of Philippians, including those from a people’s history approach, retain the consensus interpretation for identifying the targets of Paul’s oppositional polemic in these verses.¹ Even those that focus on the political (i.e., Roman imperial) as well as Greco-Roman polytheistic pagan² social context of the letter overall do not question the traditional view that Paul negatively values the continuation of Jewish identity and Judaism (or Christian Judaism) in his communities as well as in his own life.

  Abstract: A decade ago some historians of Christianity persuaded a few of us in New Testament studies to explore a “people’s history” approach to the early Jesus movements and Christ loyalists. We recognized right away that those who formed the earliest communities and movements (that later developed into what came to be known as Christianity) were subordinated and largely impoverished people. Our exploration of “history from below” entailed a departure from standard procedure in New Testament studies as well as in the related fields of classics and ancient history. In such fields, research has usually been conducted by the modern cultural<br>

In this book such differences play only a minor role, when any at all, and I have no ambitions of continuing or enhancing the old confessional discussions on Luther and Erasmus. Since Oberman, it has become more common to see both the Reformation (Lutheran, Calvinist, Radical) and Counter-Reformation as parts of a major historical and intellectual shift in the history of Europe, and thus to transcend the more narrow-minded apologetics in favor of one side or the other.¹ I even find it necessary to transcend<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

The critical human geography that began to take shape announced the interpretive significance of space and the arrival of ‘a new animating polemic on the theoretical and political agenda, one which rings with significantly different ways of seeing time and space together, the interplay of history and geography’ (Soja, 1989: 11).

  Book Title: Persistent Forms: Explorations in Historical Poetics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Maslov Boris<br>
  Abstract: Since the mid-1980s, attempts to think history and literature together have produced much exciting work in the humanities. Indeed, some form of historicism can be said to inform most of the current scholarship in literary studies, including work in poetics, yet much of this scholarship remains undertheorized. Envisioning a revitalized and more expansive historicism, this volume builds on the tradition of Historical Poetics, pioneered by Alexander Veselovsky (1838-1906) and developed in various fruitful directions by the Russian Formalists, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Olga Freidenberg. The volume includes previously untranslated texts of some of the major scholars in this critical tradition, as well as original contributions which place that tradition in dialogue with other thinkers who have approached literature in a globally comparatist and evolutionary-historical spirit. The contributors seek to challenge and complement a historicism that stresses proximate sociopolitical contexts through an engagement with the longue duree of literary forms and institutions. In particular, Historical Poetics aims to uncover deep-historical stratifications and asynchronicities, in which formal solutions may display elective affinities with other, chronologically distant solutions to analogous social and political problems. By recovering the traditional nexus of philology and history, Persistent Forms seeks to reinvigorate poetics as a theoretical discipline that would respond to such critical and intellectual developments as Marxism, New Historicism, the study of world literature, practices of distant reading, and a renewed attention to ritual, oral poetics, and genre.<br>

Notwithstanding the often tumultuous events of the twentieth century, the war still enjoys a unique status as a watershed in modern British history, and interest in it shows no sign of abating. On the contrary, not least as a result of the continuing growth in family history, interest in grandfather’s war and great-grandfather’s war ensures that it lives on in contemporary society. And yet the Great War has become a part of history in the sense that the passing of the last men<br>

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  Abstract: Lines linking eccentric cities bend through space and time – stretching between St. Petersburg and Rio de Janeiro by curving through and around a European centre and a Eurocentric history. Until recently, these cities were connected only occasionally by actual contact, more consistently by concentric ripples of modern history. They were linked directly by Portuguese navigators, sailors, soldiers and merchants who headed southeast and southwest to establish Portugal’s portals into Old and New Worlds and to secure its hold on empire, but also sailed northeast with goods and skills that helped build Peter the Great’s naval power and port city, Russia’s<br>

  Abstract: If Pushkin’s poema constitutes the cornerstone of the Petersburg text, Gogol’s Petersburg tales fill out the foundation. Yet the fundamental position of both writers’ works is paradoxical, insofar as it does not reflect origin or originality in their usual sense. Rather, it is contingent on their explicit reflection on their status as deviant, deconstructive copies of already-copied Petersburg texts. They represent a fundamental realignment and reification of the citytext, as significant in the domain of Russian literary and cultural history as Catherine’s redrawing of Peter’s blueprint,² resulting in a more dispersed, decentred, eclectic cityscape as well as the solidification of<br>

  Book Title: South African performance and archives of memory-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): HUTCHISON YVETTE<br>
  Abstract: This book explores how South Africa is negotiating its past in and through various modes of performance in contemporary theatre, public events and memorial spaces. It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Abstract: The inherited apartheid archives embody particular narratives of South Africa, especially those that defined separate cultural identities, with their relative worth and histories. The way these archives of memory were constructed and controlled is important (Rokem, 2000), especially insofar as they affected the social structure of the nation, beyond apartheid legislation. This chapter looks at how at moments of political crisis or transition, specific narratives of history, from particular cultural perspectives, have been performed in public spaces to define national identities.

  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Bakiner Onur<br>
  Abstract: Bakiner demonstrates how truth commissions have recovered basic facts about human rights violations, forced societies to rethink the violence and exclusion of nation building, and produced a new dynamic whereby the state seeks to legitimize its central position between history and politics by accepting a high degree of societal penetration into the production and diffusion of official national history. By doing so, truth commissions have challenged and transformed public discourses on memory, truth, justice, reconciliation, recognition, nationalism, and political legitimacy in the contemporary world.<br>

  Author(s): ROOF JUDITH<br>
  Abstract: The modern age is no stranger to the cabinet of curiosities, the freak show, or a drawer full of odds and ends. These collections of oddities engagingly work against the rationality and order of the conventional archive found in a university, a corporation, or a governmental holding. In form, methodology, and content, The Year's Work in the Oddball Archive offers a counterargument to a more reasoned form of storing and recording the avant-garde (or the post-avant-garde), the perverse, the off, the bent, the absurd, the quirky, the weird, and the queer. To do so, it positions itself within the history of mirabilia launched by curiosity cabinets starting in the mid-fifteenth century and continuing to the present day. These archives (or are they counter-archives?) are located in unexpected places-the doorways of Katrina homes, the cavity of a cow, the remnants of extinct animals, an Internet site-and they offer up "alternate modes of knowing" to the traditional archive.<br>

  Abstract: The Oddball Archive is a collection whose full range we are only beginning to explore. Culled from the sidebars of mainstream culture and thought, its holdings document the eccentricities of culture, thought, and archivization alike. There exists a nearly infinite expanse of such material: anomaly, after all, is the perpetual yield of any system. The history of cultural production is replete with abandoned prototypes, rejected models, crackpot theories, and antiquated media; the permutations are endless. We all too often discount the value of this material, however. Though it may be limitless in scope, its idiosyncrasy makes it difficult to take<br>

  Abstract: Tinkerers or pundits, visionaries or eccentrics, oddballs sometimes make their own archives. Surprisingly, the archives of some of history’s most anomalous figures are rarely themselves anomalous but instead come to appear exemplary because their organizing figures have emerged in some way from the pack. Oddball personae collect followings; their followers, in turn, are often the ones left in charge of collecting the oddballs’ life’s work, their leavings. The Kinsey archives, no less than the papers of the Marquis de Sade or the drawings of Adolf Wölfli, may now be managed by professional librarians, but they were once gathered and conserved<br>

  Abstract: Reckoning with the fossil remains of unfamiliar creatures, naturalists in the eighteenth century began to historicize nature. The era’s preeminent naturalist, Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon, articulated the program for this new kind of history by conceptualizing the earth itself as an archive: “As in civil history, one consults titles, one researches medals, one deciphers antique inscriptions to determine the epochs of human revolutions and discover the dates of moral events; similarly, in natural history, one must search the archives of the world, draw old monuments from the bowels of the earth, collect their debris, and assemble in a body<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter examines a range of significant developments and representative events in Canadian culture and history in order to develop an understanding of how time has been constructed socially as a form of power within the nation. In the course of building such an understanding, several conclusions come to light. Normative structures of time such as clock time, the Gregorian calendar system, and the linear notion of progress intertwine with powerful social emphases on punctuality, productivity, acceleration, temporal universality, and particular forms of temporal framing through which shorter durations are often seen as more real than longer durations, and through<br>

  Abstract: Our Bodies Are Selves is a look at what it means to be human in a world where medical technology and emerging ethical insight force us to rethink the boundaries of humanity/spirit and man/machine. This book gives us a fresh look at how our expanding biological views of ourselves and our shared evolutionary history shows us a picture that may not always illumine who and where we are as Christians. Offering up Christian theological views of embodiment, the authors give everyday examples of lives of love, faith, and bodily realities that offer the potential to create new definitions of what it means to be a faith community in an increasingly technological age of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES the Joseon Industrial Exhibition in Seoul in 1915 and how modern Japan developed its “historical” intentions by incorporating Korean architectural traditions. Constructing its history was an important part of Japan’s attempt to achieve a political status on par with the West. In this sense, “Japan as a modern state cannot be found outside the West … Criticism of Japan includes that of the West.¹ In other words, modern Japan – as well as Korea and other modern Asian nations – cannot be considered without recognizing Western influence.<br>

  Abstract: Ekphrasis no longer enjoys the name recognition it once did. In the terminology of classical rhetoric, ekphrasis “was the elaborate ‘delineation’ (έκΦρασις,
                  descriptio, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Abstract: In the decade between 1395 and 1405, Christine de Pizan successfully established herself as a major figure in French literary history. This process necessarily involved a complex coming to terms with the dominant discursive practices of the late-medieval literary tradition: the creation of a new and distinctive voice within the context of this tradition. For Christine, this posed a special set of problems. It was not simply a question of attaining and demonstrating her formal mastery of various established literary genres.

The patristic motif from which he drew his title dominated the first millennium of Christian thought, while objective theories came on the scene in the eleventh century with Anselm of Canterbury.

Meanwhile, the Christian church soon advanced from being a persecuted minority to become the state religion of the Roman Empire, and eventually, in many ways, its successor. Once the age of martyrs gave way to Christendom, the sacralized political order on which Christendom rested would create tensions of its own and these, nine centuries after Irenaeus, provide the setting for the next work to claim our attention, Anselm of Canterbury’s

  Book Title: Quiet Powers of the Possible: Interviews in Contemporary French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): HACKETT W. CHRIS<br>
  Abstract: Quiet Powers of the Possible offers an excellent introduction to contemporary French phenomenology through a series of interviews with its most prominent figures. Guided by rigorous questions that push into the most important aspects of the latest phenomenological research, the book gives readers a comprehensive sense of each thinker's intellectual history, motivations, and philosophical commitments. The book introduces readers to debates that have not previously been accessible to the English-speaking world, such as the growing interest in the phenomenological concept of life in its affective and even vital dimensions, the emerging dialogue with the analytic philosophy of mind and language, and reassessments of the so-called theological turn. The diversity of approaches collected here has its origin in a deeper debate about the conceptual and historical foundations of phenomenology itself. In this way the book offers the most accessible and wide-ranging introduction to French phenomenology to have appeared in the English-speaking world to date.<br>

  Abstract: “Theosemiotic” is a word that I coined more than twenty years ago to serve as a label for Charles Peirce’s distinctive worldview (in which he perceived the world as “God’s great poem”), as well as to identify his philosophical method for addressing religious questions or understanding religious beliefs and experiences.¹ I use the word now, more generally, to identify an ongoing, constructive project in philosophical theology. That project is deeply rooted in the history of ideas, Peirce’s thought and also that of others, and such historical considerations are the focus of my attention here.<br>

  Author(s) BLUM HESTER<br>
  Abstract: The history of the Americas in relation to the West begins with a turn: a wrong turn, as the story is commonly told. Christopher Columbus, the Genoan sailing in search of Cathay on behalf of Spain, encountered unexpected islands that he mistook for the Indies. This landfall came after he decided against returning to Europe when the voyage had proceeded farther than his frightened sailors had thought navigationally possible. In the parlance of quips about his “failure to ask for directions” (as Michelle Burnham glosses it in her contribution to this volume), Columbus took an errant turn, mistaking the Americas<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19rmckz">Local Church, Global Church</a><br>
  Author(s) Roldán Mary<br>
  Abstract: This chapter examines the history and development of Popular Cultural Action (Acción Cultural Popular, or ACPO), the multipronged project of Christian revitalization, local empowerment, and communitybased development whose radio education network, Radio Sutatenza, founded by a Colombian parish priest in 1947 to address rural adult illiteracy, became Latin America’s first Catholic radio network and the model for media-based rural education and community development programs in twenty-four countries throughout Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In nearly a half century of existence, ACPO published and distributed more than six million

  Author(s) Fitzpatrick-Behrens Susan<br>
  Abstract: This chapter explores the development of a Maya cooperative movement in Guatemala from the 1940s through the 1960s. The cooperative movement had powerful economic effects in the country. It enabled Mayas to enter the global market, to bypass ladino intermediaries, and to access new land. These changes contributed to an economic transformation with powerful political implications. Maya cooperative leaders gained knowledge and training that facilitated broader organizing. In 1975 New York Times journalist Alan Riding described the “Indian cooperative movement” as the “first authentic rural movement in Guatemala’s history, so far involving about 20 percent of the 3.5 million Indian<br>

  Abstract: A flawed teleology exists in the historiography of Catholic activism in Latin America. In this narrative the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council was conservative, preservationist, concerned with its institutional interests as opposed to the plight of the poor, and fundamentally antimodern. It was a church in captivity, chained by its own elite-centered interests, ignorant of its call to shepherd the People of God. The history of the church, in essence, was progressing from captivity to liberation: the Second Vatican Council and its Latin American interpretation, the Conference of Latin American Bishops at Medellín in 1968 was the turning<br>

  Book Title: Husserl's Missing Technologies-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): IHDE DON<br>
  Abstract: Husserl's Missing Technologies looks at the early-twentieth-century "classical" phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, both in the light of the philosophy of science of his time, and retrospectively at his philosophy from a contemporary "postphenomenology." Of central interest are his infrequent comments upon technologies and especially scientific instruments such as the telescope and microscope. Together with his analysis of Husserl, Don Ihde ventures through the recent history of technologies of science, reading and writing, and science praxis, calling for modifications to phenomenology by converging it with pragmatism. This fruitful hybridization emphasizes human-technology interrelationships, the role of embodiment and bodily skills, and the inherent multistability of technologies. In a radical argument, Ihde contends that philosophies, in the same way that various technologies contain an ever-shortening obsolescence, ought to have contingent use-lives.<br>

  Abstract: This book is a contribution to hermeneutical theology in the twenty-first century. It offers a critical analysis of this important movement within twentieth-century Protestant theology. The purpose of the analysis is not to assign this movement a place within the history of theology, thus consigning it to the past as theology moves on to face changing issues and new challenges. Rather, it is to make its concerns understandable and to point out their validity for the present. Hermeneutical theology in all of its versions has never attempted to adapt to the trends and fashionable topics of the time, but has<br>

  1  Hermeneutical Theology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t6tc">Radical Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: Everything has its time. Hermeneutical theology had its time—in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. That is a significant duration. In contrast to some other theological movements, it did not simply remain an announcement and an agenda; it actually has a history that is worth remembering. But does it have a present that is worth mentioning? Or any future at all? Are there reasons to continue that which students of Rudolf Bultmann such as Ernst Fuchs, Gerhard Ebeling, and Eberhard Jüngel—and their own students—began two or three generations ago? And what would there be to continue, if one<br>

  Abstract: The differences in understanding theology adumbrated in the foregoing were developed with exemplary, and complementary, one-sidedness by Bultmann and by Barth. The two were in agreement that Protestant theology would become superfluous as a distinct intellectual endeavor if conceived as a history-of-religions theory about Christianity and not as a resonance analysis of revelation. However, while the one developed this resonance analysis as a theology of faith, the other conceived it as a theology of revelation.<br>

  Abstract: In biblical Israel’s narrative, there is a telling of God’s identity that is not finally reducible to a mere expression of “normal” religion’s apprehension of deity. This chapter further explicates Jenson’s understanding of this “telling,” of Israel’s history, and the manner in which this drama makes and shapes the gospel promise. In addition, while aspects of Jenson’s account of the God of Israel’s intimate dealings with this people are relatively conventional, others have attracted considerable criticism. This extrapolation seeks to draw attention to innovation and locate Jenson’s characteristic moves within the conceptual nexus that integrates his system, highlighting their significance<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: God is whoever raised Jesus from the dead, having before raised Israel from Egypt. This trademark sentence of Jenson’s is, as Stanley Hauerwas observes, both “elegantly simple” and “dauntingly deep.”³ At the heart of this dense slogan is the principle that Christian discourse about God intends and is made possible by a specific reality. “God,” as we have seen Jenson argue, is intrinsically specifiable, because God is known by and with a history. The God Jesus addressed as Father and who raised him from the dead was not a previously unknown deity. Rather, as Jenson states, “It is the God<br>

  Abstract: At the heart of modernity lies a diremption between the rational and the historical, the universal and the particular. Reason confidently calls into doubt the historical enterprise, and so the possibility of a historical ground for truth. The unavailability of the historical, near or far, to the rational subject calls into radical doubt narrative forms that give shape to human life. So it is that G. E. Lessing can axiomatically declare that, “

  Abstract: After our initial look at how certain aspects of Hegel’s account of desire might transform the concept of individuality, we turned to possible repercussions for his theories of juridical ordering and the state. Then, a third textual movement attempted an articulation of subjectivity, history and infinity, the foremost aim of which was to show that the Hegelian subject exceeds all egological reductions, analytics of finitude or anthropological limitations. That is to say, Hegel leaves us with a subject sufficiently inclusive to allow for both reflections on models of institutional association, as well as modes of determination or the process of<br>

  Book Title: Nowhere in the Middle Ages-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): LOCHRIE KARMA<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on a range of contemporary scholarship on utopianism and a broad premodern archive, Lochrie charts variant utopian strains in medieval literature and philosophy that diverge from More's work and at the same time plot uncanny connections with it. Examining works such as Macrobius's fifth-century
      Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,Mandeville's Travels, and William Langland'sPiers Plowman, she finds evidence of a number of utopian drives, including the rejection of European centrality, a desire for more egalitarian politics, and a rethinking of the division between animals and humans.Nowhere in the Middle Agesinsists on the relevance and transformative potential of medieval utopias for More's work and positions the sixteenth-century text as one alternative in a broader historical phenomenon of utopian thinking. Tracing medieval utopianisms forward in literary history to reveal their influences on early modern and modern literature and philosophy, Lochrie demonstrates that looking backward, we might extend future horizons of utopian thinking.<br>

  Author(s) SYMONS STÉPHANE<br>

  Abstract: While religious and theological questions have seen a renewed interest within critical theory, metaphysics still remains under suspicion when it is not, as is so often the case in contemporary critical theory, considered a matter of little consequence. Similarly, Walter Benjamin’s drawing upon theological tropes as the conceptual framework for theorizing history and life is no longer met with criticism but rather is widely embraced and harnessed as a theoretical resource for political and ethical thought. However, as obvious as it is that Benjamin’s work is shot through with theological tropes and concepts, it proves more difficult to reflect systematically<br>

Probably the most famous case for such annihilative characterization of the divine occurs in the essay “Critique of Violence.” Yet, the account of divine violence in that essay, with its intimation of active destruction, tempts one to construe the moment of disappearance in terms of catastrophic effects wrought by God on the physical world, on the model of a force that makes visible changes in reality.

  Abstract: The phenomenon of temporary blindness to dim light after exposure to intense illumination is an experience we have come to accept as, in one way or another, common to all people. Yet, despite the familiarity and apparent simplicity of dark adaption, physiologists of vision have shown it to be a highly complex affair. And what is more interesting, the uses and meanings of scotopic vision are so rich that it could well be said to have a cultural history of its own. This paper focuses on dark adaption as a site for early X-ray imaging and cinema.<br>

  Book Title: Early Cinema and the "National"-  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): King Rob<br>
  Abstract: While many studies have been written on national cinemas, Early Cinema and the "National" is the first anthology to focus on the concept of national film culture from a wide methodological spectrum of interests, including not only visual and narrative forms, but also international geopolitics, exhibition and marketing practices, and pressing linkages to national imageries. The essays in this richly illustrated, landmark anthology are devoted to reconsidering the nation as a framing category for writing cinema history. Many of the 34 contributors show that concepts of a national identity played a role in establishing the parameters of cinema's early development, from technological change to discourses of stardom, from emerging genres to intertitling practices. Yet, as others attest, national meanings could often become knotty in other contexts, when concepts of nationhood were contested in relation to colonial/imperial histories and regional configurations. Early Cinema and the "National" takes stock of a formative moment in cinema history, tracing the beginnings of the process whereby nations learned to imagine themselves through moving images.<br>

  Abstract: “Early cinema is a global cinema.” “National cinema only appears later in film history.” I would endorse both these statements as important historical principles, and might restate them, borrowing a phrase from my colleague Michael Raine, one of the finest historians of Japanese cinema, as “cinema was international before it was national”. However, immediately a flurry of problems intervene, mainly dealing with terminology. What do we mean by: “global”, “international” or even “national”?

  Author(s) O’Brien Charles<br>
  Abstract: In the following essay I examine sound-on-disc cinema prior to World War I through a framework of national and urban comparisons. The objective is to explore sound-on-disc’s international diffusion as an example of how the cinema’s uneven global development, its geographical diversity, was conditioned by regional variations in electric power. The focus on sound-on-disc thus involves an argument that bears implications for cinema history as a whole. One aspect of the argument concerns difficulties posed to the established nation-state film historiography by electrification, a sub-or transnational phenomenon more than a national one.<br>

  Abstract: This essay presents a panorama of the evolution of viewing conventions in Istanbul, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (from the 1890s to the 1930s). Within the Ottoman Empire, Westernist, Turkist and Islamist schools of thought were in keen competition when the cinématographe arrived in Istanbul, in 1896. Traces of the discursive space configured by these schools are quite visible in Turkish cultural history, specifically in the history of cinematic spectatorship. A set of binary oppositions – between East and West, between National and International, and, finally, between Islamist and Secular – dominated the framework for reactions to the cinématographe.<br>

  Abstract: The ethnographic use of motion pictures has generally been considered lagging in comparison to the growing worldwide popularity of cinema in the early 20th century.¹ Although largely true, recent studies suggest that the situation in Germany did not follow this pattern. As Martin Taureg has shown, German ethnography’s theoretical focus on material culture combined with the country’s cinema reform movement to produce a notable early interest in the use of motion pictures as both research tool and teaching aid.² Nonetheless, what sounds like another German

  Book Title: The French Exception-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Chafer Tony<br>
  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is deeply embedded in the nation's self-image and in a range of political and academic discourses. Recently, the debate about whether France really is "exceptional" has acquired a critical edge. Against the background of introspection about the nature of "national identity," some proclaim "normalisation" and the end of French exceptionalism, while others point out to the continuing evidence that France remains distinctive at a number of levels, from popular culture to public policy. This book explores the notion of French exceptionalism, places it in its European context, examines its history and evaluate its continuing relevance in a range of fields from politics and public policy to popular culture and sport.<br>

Are all nations not in some respect exceptional?

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw85">Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness</a><br>
  Author(s) Bruner Jerome S.<br>
  Abstract: The usual answer to this question is a kind of doxology delivered in the name of “the scientific method”: Thou shalt not indulge self-delusion, nor utter unverifiable propositions, nor commit contradiction, nor treat mere history as cause, and so on. Story is not the accepted stuff of science and “logic.” If meaning-making were always dedicated to achieving a “scientific” understanding of the world, that would be one thing. But neither the empiricist’s knowledge through the senses, nor the rationalist’s route through necessary truths suffice: neither alone nor both together capture how ordinary people go about assigning meanings to their experiences—<br>

  Author(s) Straub Jürgen<br>
  Abstract: The contemporary discussion of
                  GeschichteandHistorie, of historical consciousness and historical thought, seems infinite.¹ We especially encounter these terms when our collective practice is beset by difficulties, crises, or conflicts over psychosocial or political orientation. In Germany, more than fifty years after the end of the National Socialist dictatorship, there are still very “immediate” reasons for the importance of historical reflection. Whatever may occasion this reflection, historical communication is never simply a “medium” through whichgroupsunderstand themselves—their past, present, and future.Individuals, too, understand themselves, that is, their lives, against the horizon of the history in which<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbw85">Narration, Identity, and Historical Consciousness</a><br>
  Author(s) Gergen Kenneth J.<br>
  Abstract: Two decades ago, inquiry into narrative played but a minor role in scholarly deliberation; the relationship between narrative analysis and historiography was little explored; the term “narrative” had scarcely entered the vocabulary of psychological science. Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them. Each raises different implications for our understanding of history, identity,<br>

  Author(s) Seixas Peter<br>
  Abstract: A common complaint about history education in both North American and European schools is that it consists predominantly of the memorization of factual information. There is thus a huge gap between the practices of school history and the notions of “historical consciousness” that inform this volume. My purpose in this chapter is to articulate a conception of historical consciousness that might be of use in the reform of the practice of history in the schools, in order that pedagogy might serve more purposefully to develop students’ historical consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: School children the world over spend countless hours every year learning about the past. In Western countries, the block of the school day devoted to this study is referred to as “history,” “social studies,” “civics,” “government,” or a host of other names. Yet, despite this variety in nomenclature, in practically every case, students are taught something about what transpired before their births. Despite variations in context, different national traditions and curriculuar customs, students from Tokyo to New York, Auckland to Berlin, and Tel Aviv to Toronto all learn something about a movement known as the Renaissance, an event known as<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968, often ignorantly dismissed as no more than a year of ‘student revolt’, undermined the political certainties that had endured since 1945. In Vietnam, the world’s strongest power was proved vulnerable in face of a national liberation struggle. The Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia marked a definitive end to Moscow’s hegemony over the world’s Communist Parties. In France a general strike of over nine million workers, the biggest general strike in human history, showed that the power of the working class could not be ignored; an anti-Stalinist left that had been confined to the margins of political life<br>

  Author(s) Tak Herman<br>
  Abstract: This collection of studies and essays seeks to address the pitfalls of, and the alternatives to, what has become known as the “cultural turn” (or the “historic turn”) in the social and human sciences. The cultural turn has been a multifarious and pretty pervasive phenomenon in Western universities and modes of social knowledge since the early 1980s, when, in Bill Sewell’s phrasing, a “kind of academic culture mania has set in” (Sewell 1999: 36). It embraced parts of anthropology, sociology, social theory, gender studies, literary studies, various branches of history, and science studies and laid the philosophical groundwork for the<br>

  Chapter One  Microhistorical Anthropology: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxqc">Critical Junctions</a><br>
  Author(s) Handelman Don<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between anthropology and history is one of inequality. This is no less so for the relationship between anthropology and microhistory. History, one of the noble disciplines in the “history” of Western thought, has as an emblem the muse, Clio. Anthropology has anyone who at times is everyone, at times someone, so often nameless and unvoiced. In their relationship, anthropology is the junior partner, a Johnny-come-lately to the professional telling of pastness within intellectual worlds whose denizens believe in the existence and importance of the time-depths of history, probably since these also are perceived as the sources of knowledge.<br>

  Author(s) Rebel Hermann<br>
  Abstract: The danger of transforming consequences into their own causes dogs any attempted history, but particularly one whose final objects of interest are as overwhelming as the orgies of murder that took place in East-Central Europe during the 1940s, altogether constituting those experiences and memories of insane horrors that we have come to call the Holocaust.¹ This has become a more acute logical problem as the historical field where we are currently “free” to look for the Holocaust’s provenances has steadily narrowed, even as it appears, however coincidentally, that the very global corporate and financial entities on which we all depend<br>

  Author(s) Kalb Don<br>
  Abstract: Few serious social researchers would deny the inescapability of pondering the conundrum of class—a conundrum because, while steadily contested, politically compromised, and conceptually inflated, the unsettling suspicion keeps surfacing that class involves inequality, power, culture, exploitation, accumulation, struggle and action, being in history and the making of history, being in place and the making of space, all in the same moment. Class, power, time, and space together form a huge program that has haunted social inquiry since Marx. Disciplined social science, on the other hand, has been a recurrent escape from its embrace, and understandably so, since it is<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxqc">Critical Junctions</a><br>
  Author(s) Musante Patricia<br>
  Abstract: Eric Wolf ’s emphasis on interconnected, global processes in
                  Europe and the People Without History(1982) provides a model for bringing the concerns of history, geography, and anthropology together to study the political economy of globalization, both past and present. To his list of “thingified” concepts I would add the local or thecommunitywhich have been, and continue to be, reified within anthropological discourse and practice. The boundaries of the local or the community—however broadly they may be defined or imagined—are often taken as a given, and hence naturalized. This tendency continues even as anthropologists increasingly broaden<br>

  Chapter Seven  Historical Anthropology through Local-Level Research from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxqc">Critical Junctions</a><br>
  Author(s) Gulliver P. H.<br>
  Abstract: It is a common assumption today that two paradigms typify the growing nexus between history and anthropology. One paradigm, which typifies history, is “a movement away from social history … and towards a new cultural history” (Kalb, Marks, and Tak 1996: 7). In its concern with epochs, mentalities, and collective representations, it uses anthropology as a repository of concepts, methods, and empirical data that historians can raid. The other paradigm, which typifies historical anthropology, is the one through which anthropologists operate in order to do history, using a central method of local-level research¹ and exploring issues related to “autonomy, deviance,<br>

  Author(s) Sider Gerald<br>
  Abstract: 1. The conjunction of history and anthropology (and similarly, the peculiar specialist discipline of “ethnohistory”) remains undeveloped. Much has been written about history and anthropology; indeed, the topic became a fad that is now fortunately coming to an end. Most of the writings on this conjunction have not proved useful analytical bases for understanding or developing strategies against the intensifying expansion of exploitation and domination. Yet the potential of this conjunction may still be significant, but the interweaving of the two disciplines—or better, projects—probably needs to be rebuilt from scratch. And the conjunction, as the title of this<br>

  Author(s) Jenkins Brian<br>
  Abstract: For a long time the writing of French history was profoundly influenced by what are now referred to as ‘grand narratives’, which structured our perceptions of the national past. The concern to tell a convincing and coherent story, to make history intelligible and relevant to the present, led historians from a variety of schools and disciplines to focus on the
                     longue durée, to seek out the underlying processes of change, often linked to notions of social progress, and to invest history with an inherent and unfolding logic.<br>

  Author(s) Reynolds Siân<br>
  Abstract: Is it true, as Pierre Nora claimed in 1984, that memory becomes precious just when it vanishes? ‘On ne parle tant de mémoire que parce qu’il n’y en a plus’. What he seems to mean is not that individuals have forgotten their own past, but that collective repositories of memory – such as the French
                  paysans– have been destroyed or scattered by devastating and rapid change in recent times. Memory as something magical, often tied to physical objects, rituals or sensations, can be contrasted as it is by Nora, with history, which implies critical reflection: memory is poetry, history<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbxwz">Recollections of France</a><br>
  Author(s) Winter Jay<br>
  Abstract: My subject is public history, history outside the academy, linking historians to the broad population interested – sometimes passionately interested – in historical inquiry. Public history is defined by this extension of the domain within which the scholar operates. The audience for historical literature defines the discipline as much as the professional credentials of the practitioner. Public history is thus an attempt to flee from the increasing specialisation and decreasing readership of professional academic work, both in journals and in monograph form. It is also a recognition that historical scholarship is intrinsically tied to concepts of educating the public, and<br>

The termproduits de terroiritself is notoriously difficult to define, but it is perhaps best described as traditional ‘local agricultural products and foodstuffs’ (English official rendering) whose qualities cross time and space and are anchored in a specific place and history.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz63">Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Lüsebrink Hans-jürgen<br>
  Abstract: In the Western cultural and social sciences, one usually considers the existence of a nation from three main angles: 1) that of the existence of a national state, 2) of a community living within some well-defined borders, and 3) through national awareness, in which national history can play a central role. In the case of African history and historiography, it is necessary though to reconsider the question with the help of criteria which differ from those used to study its European counterpart:<br>

  Author(s) Geulen Christian<br>
  Abstract: It has become almost obligatory in recent work on the history of nationalism to insist that this very history has not and, for the time being, will not come to an end. History continues in the conflicts in Eastern Europe, in the Western revival of the nation as an acknowledged cultural category, and also in the ethnic con-flicts of postcolonial societies. Such observations presuppose that nationalism exists as such and that it possesses one single history, despite all evident differences. In contradistinction to phenomena such as Imperialism, Communism or National Socialism, which appear to be fixed in time and space,<br>

  Abstract: By the end of 1977 antitotalitarianism clearly dominated the politics of the noncommunist intellectual Left. Intellectuals, fearing the worst from the parties of the Left in power, found threats of totalitarianism in all but the most impotent political projects. The political logic of their critique of the PCF and of the Union of the Left favored analyses that were focused on ideology and divorced from the concrete realities of contemporary France or Soviet history. While unconsciously drawing on resources within French republican political culture to combat the supposed totalitarian threat, they asserted that the apparent past blindness of French intellectuals<br>

  Author(s) Feldman Allen<br>
  Abstract: At no other time more than in the present day has individual, social and institutional memory come under such concerted pressure, critique and exposure as a fragile foundation for truth and facticity. This current reluctance to authenticate social memory is intimately tied to well-known postmodernist depredations, which profoundly disenchanted the authority of tradition and authenticity, and emptied core institutionalised myths of their temporal and semantic continuity. As institutionalised memory fails to provide overarching master narratives that can win cultural consent, it has also become increasingly disjunctive with previously unnarratable history and experience. Consider the synchronic fictions of recent ethno-histories, the<br>

Certainly this has been my experience as a woman academic. I am confronted with disparities in power. I am obliged to confront my gender because it is made clear to me on a daily basis.

  Book Title: Critical White Studies-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stefancic Jean<br>
  Abstract: No longer content with accepting whiteness as the norm, critical scholars have turned their attention to whiteness itself. In
      Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror, numerous thinkers, including Toni Morrison, Eric Foner, Peggy McIntosh, Andrew Hacker, Ruth Frankenberg, John Howard Griffin, David Roediger, Kathleen Heal Cleaver, Noel Ignatiev, Cherrie Moraga, and Reginald Horsman, attack such questions as:*How was whiteness invented, and why?*How has the category whiteness changed over time?*Why did some immigrant groups, such as the Irish and Jews, start out as nonwhite and later became white?*Can some individual people be both white and nonwhite at different times, and what does it mean to "pass for white"?*At what point does pride in being white cross the line into white power or white supremacy?*What can whites concerned over racial inequity or white privilege do about it?Science and pseudoscience are presented side by side to demonstrate how our views on whiteness often reflect preconception, not fact. For example, most scientists hold that race is not a valid scientific category -- genetic differences between races are insignificant compared to those within them. Yet, the "one drop" rule, whereby those with any nonwhite heritage are classified as nonwhite, persists even today. As the bell curve controversy shows, race concepts die hard, especially when power and prestige lie behind them.A sweeping portrait of the emerging field of whiteness studies,Critical White Studiespresents, for the first time, the best work from sociology, law, history, cultural studies, and literature. Delgado and Stefancic expressly offer critical white studies as the next step in critical race theory. In focusing on whiteness, not only do they ask nonwhites to investigate more closely for what it means for others to be white, but also they invite whites to examine themselves more searchingly and to "look behind the mirror."<br>

Yet for all its monumental proportions, the book cast a curiously slender historiographical shadow. Jordan’s work did not become the centerpiece of a long and fruitful scholarly debate. It sits on our shelves, the proverbial book we read in graduate school. It was Jordan’s singular misfortune to produce a history of racial attitudes at the same time that Americans were beginning to look beyond racism to the political and economic sources of social inequality.

Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

The public function of collective memory, in the form of commemorations or museums, as in the evocation of traumatic memories shared by entire social groups, has become a topic of lively debate in a large number of theoretical areas, ranging from cognitive science to sociology, political theory, history, and other disciplines of social inquiry. It is the singular achievement of the recent work of Paul Ricoeur,

  Abstract: Someone who knows the history of this building is likely to think it appropriate that a symposium entitled Religion and Politics is being held here in the Koepelkerk, or “domed church,” also known as the Round Lutheran Church. The original church here on the Singel was built in 1671. Since then it has twice been destroyed by fire. The first Lutheran church was built in 1633 at Singel 411, on the corner with the Spui. Most of that building is now used by the University of Amsterdam.<br>

  Abstract: Upon hearing the standard disciplinary history of the science of religion (
                  Religionswissenschaft),¹ one might get the impression that, by the second half of the nineteenth century, talk of fetishism should have been all but dead. By then, “fetishism” as a particular type or form of religious belief and practice was supposedly no longer a viable or respectable category in debating the origin, evolution, or morphology of religion. Thus we read in the Victorian chapter of this history about the rise—and usually also the fall—of various theories concerning the origin of religion, such as Edward B. Tylor’s animism theory,<br>

  Book Title: Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Newmark Kevin<br>
  Abstract: What is it about irony--as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity--that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, Soren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.<br>

  Abstract: It is no easy task to determine the proper place of the “political” within the writings of Paul de Man. The difficulties inherent in the question stem not so much from the absence of references to history and politics in his writing—on the contrary; it is a rare text by de Man that does not mention law, politics, economics, social unrest, war, or revolution. The problem arises instead from the way such references can become intelligible only in the context of analyses that are themselves not in the first place either historical or political.

  Abstract: If we look at its history, hermeneutics never was anything but diacritical. In his seminal essay on the origins of hermeneutics (“Die Geburt der Hermeneutik,” 1900), Wilhelm Dilthey argued that hermeneutics was born in Alexandria, in the Hellenistic period. Although according to Dilthey the art of
                  hermēneia(interpretation) was already practiced in classical Greece, it is only with the post-classical Alexandrian school of philology that hermeneutics became a self-standing discipline.

  Book Title: Re-treating Religion: Deconstructing Christianity with Jean-Luc Nancy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nancy Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: One of the most complicated and ambiguous tendencies in contemporary western societies is the phenomenon referred to as the turn to religion.In philosophy, one of the most original thinkers critically questioning this turnis Jean-Luc Nancy. Re-treating Religion is the first volume to analyze his long-term project The Deconstruction of Christianity,especially his major statement of it in Dis-Enclosure.Nancy conceives monotheistic religion and secularization not as opposite worldviews that succeed each other in time but rather as springing from the same history. This history consists in a paradoxical tendency to contest one's own foundations-whether God, truth, origin, humanity, or rationality-as well as to found itself on the void of this contestation. Nancy calls this unique combination of self-contestation and self-foundation the self-deconstructionof the Western world.The book includes discussion with Nancy himself, who contributes a substantial Preambleand a concluding dialogue with the volume editors. The contributions follow Nancy in tracing the complexities of Western culture back to the persistent legacy of monotheism, in order to illuminate the tensions and uncertainties we face in the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: Hidden Intercourse: Eros and Sexuality in the History of Western Esotericism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kripal Jeffrey J.<br>
  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Book Title: Ascent into Heaven in Luke-Acts-New Explorations of Luke's Narrative Hinge<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Pao David W.<br>
  Abstract: In comparison with other aspects of Jesus’ life and ministry, his ascent into heaven has often been overlooked within the history of the church. However, considering its placement at the end of the Gospel and the beginning of Acts—the only narrative depictions of the event in the New Testament—the importance of Jesus’ ascent into heaven is undeniable for Luke’s two-volume work. While select studies have focused on particular aspects of these accounts for Luke’s story, the importance of the ascension calls for renewed attention to the narratological and theological significance of these accounts within their historical and literary contexts. In this volume, leading scholars discuss the ascension narratives within the ancient contexts of biblical, Second Temple Jewish, and Greco-Roman literature; the literary contours of Luke-Acts; and questions of historical and theological significance in the wider milieu of New Testament theology and early Christian historiography. The volume sets out new positions and directions for the next generations of interpreters regarding one of the most important and unique elements of the Lukan writings.<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

It is certain, in any case, that the centuries-old invocation of a

  Book Title: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGrath Brian<br>
  Abstract: Constellations of a Contemporary Romanticism takes its title and point of departure from Walter Benjamin's concept of the historical constellation, which puts both "contemporary" and "romanticism" in play as period designations and critical paradigms. Featuring fascinating and diverse contributions by an international roster of distinguished scholars working in and out of romanticism--from deconstruction to new historicism, from queer theory to postcolonial studies, from visual culture to biopolitics--this volume makes good on a central tenet of Benjamin's conception of history: These critics "grasp the constellation" into which our "own era has formed with a definite earlier one." Each of these essays approaches romanticism as a decisive and unexpired thought experiment that makes demands on and poses questions for our own time: What is the unlived of a contemporary romanticism? What has romanticism's singular untimeliness bequeathed to futurity? What is romanticism's contemporary "redemption value" for painting and politics, philosophy and film?<br>

  Book Title: A Practice of Anthropology-The Thought and Influence of Marshall Sahlins<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KELLY JOHN D.<br>
  Abstract: Marshall Sahlins (b. 1930) is an American anthropologist who played a major role in the development of anthropological theory in the second half of the twentieth century. Over a sixty-year career, he and his colleagues synthesized trends in evolutionary, Marxist, and ecological anthropology, moving them into mainstream thought. Sahlins is considered a critic of reductive theories of human nature, an exponent of culture as a key concept in anthropology, and a politically engaged intellectual opposed to militarism and imperialism. This collection brings together some of the world’s most distinguished anthropologists to explore and advance Sahlins’s legacy. All of the essays are based on original research, most dealing with cultural change - a major theme of Sahlins’s research, especially in the contexts of Fijian and Hawaiian societies. Like Sahlins’s practice of anthropology, these essays display a rigorous, humanistic study of cultural forms, refusing to accept comfort over accuracy, not shirking from the moral implications of their analyses. Contributors include the late Greg Dening, one of the most eminent historians of the Pacific, Martha Kaplan, Patrick Kirch, Webb Keane, Jonathan Friedman, and Joel Robbins, with a preface by the late Claude Levi-Strauss. A unique volume that will complement the many books and articles by Sahlins himself, A Practice of Anthropology is an exciting new addition to the history of anthropological study.<br>

  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

Yes, Moses created the Jews and Judaism by restoring the Father to them alone, through his own person and in the teaching of the one omnipotent God of the universe. Following his death this revelation was repressed in turn, only to reemerge from its state of unconscious latency in the teachings of the prophets, which would become the common patrimony of the entire Jewish people.<br>

  Book Title: Archaeology and Memory-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): Borić Dušan<br>
  Abstract: Memory can be both a horrifying trauma and an empowering resource. From the Ancient Greeks to Nietzsche and Derrida, the dilemma about the relationship between history and memory has filled many pages, with one important question singled out: is the writing of history to memory a remedy or a poison? Recently, a growing interest in and preoccupation with the issue of memory, remembering and forgetting has resulted in a proliferation of published works, in various disciplines, that have memory as their focus. This trend, to which the present volume contributes, has started to occupy the dominant discourses of disciplines such as sociology, philosophy, history, anthropology and archaeology, and has also disseminated into the wider public discourse of society and culture today. Such a condition may perhaps echo the phenomenon of a melancholic experience at the turn of the millennium. Archaeology and Memory seeks to examine the diversity of mnemonic systems and their significance in different past contexts as well as the epistemological and ontological importance of archaeological practice and narratives in constituting the human historical condition. The twelve substantial contributions in this volume cover a diverse set of regional examples and focus on a range of prehistoric and classical case studies in Eurasian regional contexts as well as on the predicaments of memory in examples of the archaeologies of 'contemporary past'. From the Mesolithic and Neolithic burial chambers to the trenches of World War I and the role of materiality in international criminal courts, a number of contributors examine how people in the past have thought about their own pasts, while others reflect on our own present-day sensibilities in dealing with the material testimonies of recent history. Both kinds of papers offer wider theoretical reflections on materiality, archaeological methodologies and the ethical responsibilities of archaeological narration about the past.<br>

  Author(s) Jones Andrew<br>
  Abstract: A number of features characterise mortuary rituals at the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Age in Britain (the period covering approximately 2200–1500 BC). These include the construction of barrows of layered earth and stone cairns of mounded rubble covering the dead; the burial of individuals as inhumations or cremations enclosed in grave cuts, stone cists, or coffins; and the deposition of artefacts in close association with the dead. Outside the mortuary sphere, but necessarily connected with it, this period of prehistory also witnesses the emergence of large scale hoards of artefacts, typically metalwork, typically<br>

  Abstract: Within an imperial framework, individuals and groups invoke memories of the past to denote both their social identity and their placement within the empire. An examination of quotidian mnemonic processes offers an opportunity for us to explore the ways in which local peoples negotiated, influenced, and responded to imperial social climates. The Roman Empire provides a salient framework for exploring memory because it was the iconic ancient empire, inscribing its control over a vast range of territories and peoples, each with its own distinct history and identity. The present work explores two Roman Egyptian houses as touchstones for the complex<br>

  Book Title: Land and People-Papers in Memory of John G. Evans<br>
  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): O’Connor Terry<br>
  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: The nature of the postglacial history of the chalklands has long been recognised to be of ecological significance – its relevance to people and archaeology is obvious and is emphasised by the mystery and myth imbued in the environment created within ancient woodlands. But at a pragmatic level, the presence of woodland and its

  Author(s) Gardiner Julie<br>
  Abstract: The vegetation history, and its relevance to early prehistoric (postglacial) human communities on the chalk downlands of southern England, was essentially clearly proven and defined in broad terms in the 1970s, largely through the work of John Evans (1971a; 1972; 1975; Evans & Jones 1979). It was confirmed and re-affirmed by later workers (eg, Thomas 1982; Scaife 1980a) etc. Although shaken in the late 1980s by the arguments proffered by Bush and Flenley (1986) and Bush (1988), those arguments were fiercely countered by Thomas (Thomas 1989; Bush 1989).

  Abstract: The study of coasts and islands provides many opportunities. Many sites, now on our coast, may be presevered and protected by depositional processes enveloping them in sequences of blown sand, facilitating both exceptional preservation, and potentially great stratigraphic separation of sequences of activity such as at Gwithian, Brean Down, Nornour and Northton for instance. In many cases their costal position today may belie their location in prehistory. Conversely, others may be exposed by coastal erosion making them available for research for a short window of time before they are ultimately lost to us. Islands allow us to examine island communities<br>

  Abstract: Environmental studies undertaken at Roman villas have tended to focus on food items, either seeds or the remains of domestic livestock that provide insights into the local economy. Some pollen analytical studies have also been undertaken, the most useful often being those from off-site locations where longer records may be recovered (Dark & Dark 1997). Such pollen studies have enabled the reconstruction of the vegetational history and the nature of the regional landscape.

This is the so-called ‘argument from evil’ – the term ‘evil’ being used here as shorthand for the existence of pain and suffering. We briefly referred to this argument in Chapter One: the indisputable fact that an innocent child dies of cancer is, so the atheist argues, incompatible with any notion of God as an omnipotent and benevolent being.¹ Any counter theistic attempt to resolve this alleged incompatibility is, to borrow a term from the German philosopher, Gottfried Leibniz (1648-1716), technically known as a<br>

  Book Title: In the Fellowship of His Suffering-A Theological Interpretation of Mental Illness — A Focus on "Schizophrenia"<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Swinton John<br>
  Abstract: Schizophrenia is often considered one of the most destructive forms of mental illness. Elahe Hessamfar’s personal experience with her daughter’s illness has led her to ask some pressing and significant questions about the cause and nature of schizophrenia and the Church’s role in its treatment. With a candid and revealing look at the history of mental illness, In the Fellowship of His Suffering describes schizophrenia as a variation of human expression. Hessamfar uses a deeply theological rather than pathological approach to interpret the schizophrenic experience and the effect it has on both the patients and their families. Effectively drawing on the Bible as a source of knowledge for understanding mental illness, she offers a reflective yet innovative view of whether the Church could or should intervene in such encounters and what such an intervention might look like. Hessamfar’s comprehensive work will provoke powerful responses from anyone interested in the prominent social issue of mental illness. Her portrayal of the raging debate between treating “insanity" either pastorally or medically will enthral readers, be they Christians, medical students or those in the field of psychiatry and social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: The ubiquity of mental illness and its exponential growth in the US has made it the primary “medical disability” of our time. This pervasiveness and the destructive force behind it to destroy human spirit demands an urgent attention not only from medical community and social policy makers, but also from the church. In the history of Christian communities, mental illness has tended to be viewed as some form of malignant manifestation that stands against the will and rule of God. It has thus tended to evoke a response from within the church. Today, for the most part, that response has<br>

Throughout history man has been an enigma, and a paradox, not only in the pages of Scripture, but also to himself and his fellow human beings. Although there have been many studies on every detail of a human’s life concerning his social, psychological, economical, political, physiological, and cultural status in life, one seemingly trivial question that has puzzled philosophers, scientists, and laymen alike, driving the fundamental answer to all aforementioned categories, is

  Abstract: In this study we observed that the experiences of those suffering from mental illness call into question our collective Western understanding of these phenomena. Historically, how the experiences are named determined the types of treatment that were deemed to be appropriate. The church has participated in this process, but laterally, the naming, framing and responding to those experiences have become the terrain of psychiatry. Psychiatry has a questionable history and has been the location for various political, economic, and professional power struggles as the discipline has developed and has sought to offer a rationale for its existence.<br>

  Abstract: Universalism runs like a slender thread through the history of Christian theology. Over the centuries Christian universalism, in one form or another, has been reinvented time and time again. In this book an international team of scholars explore the diverse universalisms of Christian thinkers from the Origen to Moltmann. In the introduction Gregory MacDonald argues that theologies of universal salvation occupy a space between heresy and dogma. The studies in this collection aim, in the first instance, to hear, understand, and explain the eschatological claims of a range of Christians from the third to the twenty-first centuries. They also offer some constructive, critical engagement with those claims.<br>

  Abstract: At the most simple level Christian universalism is the belief that God will (or, in the case of “hopeful universalism,”
                  might) redeem all people through the saving work of Christ. Within the history of Christianity such a belief has been a minority sport, and those who have embraced it have been, with some notable exceptions, not very well known. Indeed, it would probably be true to say that for most of Christian history the majority of Christians have thought that such a belief was outside the bounds of orthodoxy.

  Book Title: Dealing with Dictators-The United States, Hungary, and East Central Europe, 1942-1989<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): VINCZ JASON<br>
  Abstract: Dealing with Dictators explores America's Cold War efforts to make the dictatorships of Eastern Europe less tyrannical and more responsive to the country's international interests. During this period, US policies were a mix of economic and psychological warfare, subversion, cultural and economic penetration, and coercive diplomacy. Through careful examination of American and Hungarian sources, László Borhi assesses why some policies toward Hungary achieved their goals while others were not successful. When George H. W. Bush exclaimed to Mikhail Gorbachev on the day the Soviet Union collapsed, "Together we liberated Eastern Europe and unified Germany," he was hardly doing justice to the complicated history of the era. The story of the process by which the transition from Soviet satellite to independent state occurred in Hungary sheds light on the dynamics of systemic change in international politics at the end of the Cold War.<br>

The biblical text has a rich historical context in the ancient Near East that aids the reader in understanding what the text meant. However, this history is not a static history, locked in the past. Instead, it is a dynamic history of the divine acts of God that can be seen throughout the canonizing process as successive generations interpreted the tradition and text for their situations.

There are compelling reasons for wanting to avoid the complexities associated with achieving reconciliation and repair between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I am not Indigenous. I am an Anglican priest representing an institution with a history of misplaced presumptions and misguided policies in its dealings with Indigenous people. The practice of restorative justice among Indigenous Australians has not been uniformly welcomed or effective. The potential to repeat these mistakes of the past is ever-present.<br>

Other, surprising figures also appear, such as Shakespeare, Washington and Lincoln. How did these figures from history interpret Scripture? What might their diverse approaches teach today’s readers of the Old and New Testaments? What is missing in contemporary biblical interpretation that an awareness of the history of exegesis might complete? Join C.

  Book Title: Returning to Reality-Christian Platonism for our Times<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Tyson Paul<br>
  Abstract: Could it be that we have lost touch with some basic human realities in our day of high-tech efficiency, frenetic competition, and ceaseless consumption? Have we turned from the moral, the spiritual, and even the physical realities that make our lives meaningful? These are metaphysical questions -questions about the nature of reality- but they are not abstract questions. These are very down to earth questions that concern power and the collective frameworks of belief and action governing our daily lives. This book is an introduction to the history, theory, and application of Christian metaphysics. Yet this book is not just an introduction, it is also a passionately argued call for a profound change in the contemporary Christian mind. Paul Tyson argues that as Western culture’s Christian Platonist understanding of reality was replaced by modern pragmatic realism, we turned not just from one outlook on reality to another, but away from reality itself. This book seeks to show that if we can recover this ancient Christian outlook on reality, reframed for our day, then we will be able to recover a way of life that is in harmony with human and divine truth.<br>

  Book Title: The Scarlet Woman and the Red Hand-Evangelical Apocalyptic Belief in the Northern Ireland Troubles<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Searle Joshua T.<br>
  Abstract: This book provides a comprehensive description of how evangelicals in Northern Ireland interpreted the "Troubles" (1966-2007) in the light of how they read the Bible. The rich and diverse landscape of Northern Irish evangelicalism during the "Troubles" is ideally suited to this study of both the light and dark sides of apocalyptic eschatology. Searle demonstrates how the notion of apocalypse shaped evangelical and fundamentalist interpretations of the turbulent events that characterized this dark yet fascinating period in the history of Northern Ireland. The book uses this case study to offer a timely reflection on some of the most pressing issues in contemporary negotiations between culture and religion. Given the current resurgence of religious fundamentalism in the wake of 9/11, together with popular conceptions of a "clash of civilizations" and the so-called War on Terror, this book is not only an engaging academic study; it also resonates with some of the defining cultural issues of our time.<br>

  Abstract: Few questions exert such a great fascination on human conscience as those related to the meaning of life, history, and death. The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

The portrait of humankind painted by the scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam regards the human person as a psycho-somatic unity. Scientific evidence increasingly points to the truth that human beings are fundamentally embodied in nature, contrary to the Greek-influenced mind-body dualism that has reigned for most of Western theological and philosophical history.

  Abstract: In Paul S.

It is a truly international and encompassing tour of the history of hermeneutics both in the West and East Asia. What is particularly refreshing is that this is a comparison of diverse hermeneutical traditions or as the Neo-Confucians would say, the art of reading through the multi-colored<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf16n">The Hermeneutical Self and an Ethical Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: “The end of ideologies” has changed into the end of history,¹ according to Fukuyama: liberal democracy constitutes the end point of humankind’s ideological evolution and the final form of human government; and, finally, liberal democracy forms the end of history.² In the phase of late capitalism embedded within the empire and the end of ideologies, a lifeworld is violated, reified, and colonized by political power, capital dominion, and mass media. In taking issue with this process of colonizing the lifeworld, Habermas’s notion of communicative moral practice becomes a counter proposal to “the end of ideologies” and can be endorsed as<br>

  Abstract: An encounter with the Other is further to be conceptualized in a broader intercivilizational and global-critical spectrum. I am interested in conceptualizing such a reconstruction of hermeneutical self and ethical difference in a Confucian context. Chapter 14 deals with the necessity and purpose of dialogue between civilizations in the aftermath of colonialism. The basic argument of this chapter is to examine the contribution of non-Western culture and civilization as an irregular or subside to Western modernity. Critically scrutinizing Western civilization and modernity, my concern is to emphasize the Confucian contribution together with Latin American, African, and Islamic history.<br>

This new perspective articulates the important task of archeological endeavor in rewriting and re-reading the history of the innocent victim as excluded and silenced. History is not deconstructed in the name of binary oppositions, but to remember, in our current socio-biographical solidarity, those who are fragile and vulnerable, existing in the interstitial zone.

  Book Title: Sacramental Presence after Heidegger-Onto-theology, Sacraments, and the Mother's Smile<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Conor<br>
  Abstract: "Theology after Heidegger must take into account history and language as elements in the pursuit of meaning. Quite often, this prompts a hurried flight from metaphysics to an embrace of an absence at the center of Christian narrativity. Conor Sweeney here explores the “postmodern" critique of presence in the context of sacramental theology, engaging the thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet and Lieven Boeve. Chauvet is an influential postmodern theologian whose critique of the perceived onto-theological constitution of presence in traditional sacramental theology has made big waves, while Boeve is part of a more recent generation of theologians who even more wholeheartedly embrace postmodern consequences for theology. Sweeney considers the extent to which postmodernism à la Heidegger upsets the hermeneutics of sacramentality, asking whether this requires us to renounce the search for a presence that by definition transcends us. Against both the fetishization of presence and absence, Sweeney argues that metaphysics has a properly sacramental basis, and that it is only through this reality that the dialectic of presence and absence can be transcended. The case is made for the full but restless signification of the mother’s smile as the paradigm for genuine sacramental presence."<br>

  2  Sacramental Presence in Louis-Marie Chauvet from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf1rx">Sacramental Presence after Heidegger</a><br>
  Abstract: The theology of Louis-Marie Chauvet is a sustained example of how Heidegger can be made productive in the theology of sacramental presence, and also theology in general. Chauvet moves his theological statements completely outside of the realm of metaphysics understood as a privileged discursive conceptualism; such statements may only be made via a phenomenology and hermeneutics of the ritual dynamic proper to Christian liturgy. In this symbolic mode, as we will see, theological statements, no longer mediated by traditional metaphysics, will be weighted more towards history than ontology, and therefore more towards absence than presence.

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I argued for the viability of a theological engagement with history for the purpose of informing our theology of the atonement with the historical intention of Jesus of Nazareth. The task now is to discuss what can be known of the world of meaning that Jesus constituted for his death and then, in the next chapter, to bring these results to bear on our understanding of Christian atonement. Easy enough perhaps to state, a rather more difficult task in practice. Indeed, the endeavor threatens to become all-consuming; John Meier’s four-volume work is ample evidence of the<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book we have wrestled with the question of how to conceive of sacrament and sacramentality in a way that consists with the postmodern imagination. We have seen that the meaning of the Eucharist, and by extension sacramentality, may be derived from the endless matrix of signification within which it exists. In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather

  Abstract: It is a commonplace that today we live globally—and often locally as well—in a multicultural society where different cultures coexist, oscillating between cooperation and competition. These multicultural settings are the result of various factors, from the migration movements of large groups of people caused by economic necessity, war, oppression, displacement, and the search for better opportunities for shaping one’s life. If one wanted to write a diachronic history of the genesis of most multicultural societies, one would come across the most grievous aspects of modern history, racism, nationalism, ethnic strife, exploitation, and religious oppression, leading to the banishment<br>

  Abstract: Historical research has often focused on how the doctrines of Luther’s theology were used by rulers and kings to legitimize power. However, Luther’s theology provided tools for men of political power and critics alike. The latter aspect needs to be explored in a more sophisticated fashion. In this chapter I will try to do just that. I will present a case from Swedish church history where Luther’s doctrine of the priesthood of all believers seems to have worked as an unexplored precursor of public opinion, and as a new way to legitimize power from below.<br>

  Book Title: The Philokalia and the Inner Life-On Passions and Prayer<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Cook Christopher C.H.<br>
  Abstract: The Philokalia was published in Venice in 1782. It is an anthology of patristic writings from the Eastern Church, spanning the 4th to the 15th Centuries, which has been the subsequent focus of a significant revival in Orthodox spirituality. It presents an understanding of psychopathology and mental life which is significantly different to that usually encountered in western Christianity. It also presents accounts of both mental well-being and the pathologies of the mind or soul that are radically different to contemporary secular accounts and yet also find remarkable points of similarity with contemporary psychotherapeutic approaches, such as cognitive therapy. The book provides an introduction to the history of the Philokalia and the philosophical, anthropological and theological influences that contributed to its information. It presents a critical account of the pathologies of the soul, the remedies for these pathologies, and the therapeutic goals as portrayed by the authors of the Philokalia. It then offers a critical engagement of this material with a contemporary understanding of psychotherapy. Finally, it raises important questions about the relationship between thoughts and prayer.<br>

  Abstract: Theological discourse, whether implicitly or explicitly, is in search of some kind of justification. It was because of its contamination by various intellectual heresies, old and new, that often this justificatory practice rather than letting the discourse flow beyond itself, tended to lead it into the fortress of a regulatory concept, practice or institution or a contingent or illusory foundation. But as history so often witnesses, it is precisely when discourse guards itself most securely that it must face the most formidable objection because it loses its ecstatic character, ceasing thus to reflect the overriding feature of its source.<br>

What does the Tanakh then do with this view of knowing throughout its texts? Stated otherwise, is the epistemological process of Genesis 2–3 unique or normative? We contend below that Scripture recounts Israel’s errors in terms of Genesis 2–3, where knowing is contingent upon which authority is being heeded, and then whether or not the knower participates in the prescribed route to knowledge (e.g., not eating the fruit of prohibition).

This was more than a theological affirmation, for even as the revelation of Christ in the course of the history of God’s saving deeds ushered all of humanity into the Christian dispensation (historically<br>

  Book Title: The Dialogical Spirit-Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Yong Amos<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary proposals for Christian theology from post-liberalism to Radical Orthodoxy and beyond have espoused their own methodological paradigms. Those who have ventured into this domain of theological method, however, have usually had to stake their claims vis-à-vis trends in what may be called the contemporary "post-al" age, whether of the post-modern, post-Christendom, post-Enlightenment, post-Western, or post-colonial varieties. This volume is unique among offerings in this arena in suggesting a way forward that engages on each of these fronts, and does so from a particularistic Christian perspective without giving up on Christian theology's traditional claims to universality. This is accomplished through the articulation of a distinctive dialogical methodology informed by both Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, one rooted in the Christian salvation-history narrative of Incarnation and Pentecost that is yet open to the world in its many and various cultural, ethnic, religious, and disciplinary discourses. Amos Yong here engages with twelve different interlocutors representing different ecumenical, religious, and disciplinary perspectives. 'The Dialogical Spirit' thus not only proffers a model for Christian theological method suitable for the twenty-first century global context but also exemplifies this methodological approach through its interactions across the contemporary scholarly, inter-religious, and theological landscape.<br>

Thus, ecumenical challenges to thefilioqueadded to the creed of Nicea and Constantinople have a well-known history.

In part because of the troubled history of the concept, and partly because of the contemporary use of the term “experience,” originary experience may seem a doubtful starting point. “Experience,” in fact, has been described as the “most deceitful” and “most obscure” of terms.¹ Nevertheless, if by originary experience we mean the engagement of the whole of our being with the whole of reality and with God, who is their innermost and transcendent center, originary experience, despite its difficulties, can<br>

  Book Title: Allegorizing History-The Venerable Bede, Figural Exegesis and Historical Theory<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Furry Timothy J.<br>
  Abstract: What is history? This question can be taken in many ways, including radically skeptical ones, but in 'Allegorizing History' Timothy J. Furry asks the questions not with that axe to grind but because it has become clear to him, through study of Bede and other ancient Christians, that history is not so simple. To be sure, many, if not all scholars, know that thanks to the work of postmodern philosophers and twentieth-century historical theorists like R.G. Collingwood, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Hayden White. In this work, Furry shows that there are competing notions and purposes of historical practice, more specifically between Bede and the scholars who have recently studied him. Moreover, he explaisn why this difference matters and what implications result from such competing notions and practices of history, especially in the exegesis of Scripture as well as how exegesis also influences conceptions of history. Following a tradition of historians and theologians who have sought to blur the lines between theology and other disciplines, Furry explores how, if biblical exegesis was not an isolated discipline for ancient and medieval Christians, then its effects should be seen in other arenas. His argument here is that one of these arenas or disciplines is history.<br>

One of these problems revolves around how language refers in its literal and historical usage. Recall that Bede read the days in Genesis 1 as literal 24-hour days, despite Augustine’s unwillingness to affirm such a reading in his literal commentary on Genesis. For Bede the literal and the allegorical were in tension with each other; when one moves to allegory,<br>

Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  TWO  Antigone and Athenian War-dead: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbg4">Making Memory</a><br>
  Abstract: Biblical texts are not the only ancient texts with a significant interpretative afterlife. Western culture has also had a lengthy relationship of rereading with the literature of ancient Greece and Rome—this is the origin of the “Western philosophical tradition,” which I contrasted with the Jewish tradition of biblical interpretation in chapter one. In this chapter, I will turn to a brief examination of Sophocles’
                  Antigoneand its history of interpretation as a window into the way that discourse over mourning and ownership of the dead has developed. This discussion will provide a framework for the readings of Canadian material<br>

  Book Title: Religion and Violence-A Dialectical Engagement through the Insights of Bernard Lonergan<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Arcamone Dominic<br>
  Abstract: The aim of Religion and Violence is to engage dialectically key symbols of religiously motivated violence through the insights of Bernard Lonergan. Sociologists and psychologists argue the link between religion and violence. Religion is viewed more as part of the problem and not part of the solution to violence. Bernard Lonergan’s insights have helped the author arrive at a number of conclusions regarding the link between religion and violence. He argues that there is a difference between distorted religion and genuine religion, between authenticity and inauthenticity of the subject. Distorted religion has the capacity to shape traditions in ways that justify violence, while genuine religion heals persons, helps them make different moral decisions when confronted with situations of conflict, and aims to explore new ways of understanding themselves as shaping history toward progress. Further, Religion and Violence, while arguing from within the Catholic Christian tradition, nevertheless seeks to provide a number of categories that will speak to people from other cultural traditions. Since many of the examples of religious violence cited by commentators come out of the Islamic tradition, the author has evidenced and explored more authentic aspects of the Islamic tradition that would help provide a solution to violence.<br>

  Abstract: At this point, I want to present a justification for turning to the insights of the Catholic Canadian theologian and philosopher, Bernard Lonergan. While Lonergan’s works do not specifically concern themselves with religiously motivated violence, his insights nevertheless address the problem of violence by examining the performance of the subject as subject and by providing a philosophical analysis of the self-transcending subject. Lonergan postulates a set of foundational categories for discerning how we come to have religious knowledge, an explanatory account of historical progress and breakdown in human history, and a way forward for recovery in history that is achieved<br>

  7  A Dialectical Engagement with Martyrdom from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbhn">Religion and Violence</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I engage dialectically with the idea of martyrdom, the second of Juergensmeyer’s symbols for understanding the link between violence and religion. I critique his claim that religious martyrdom and self-sacrifice are simply ritualized rites of destruction that in the eyes of religious agents leave the impression of a religious heroism that transforms history. Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

The present chapter examines the character of God’s creative activity, as determined by the divine being, in order to disclose the meaning of the first presupposition for the Christian symbol of divine suffering as well as to illumine the basis upon which to analyze this symbol’s second presupposition.

  Abstract: The systematic study of gardens as loci of food production during the Middle Ages has largely been overlooked by agrarian historians. Economic agrarian history is based epistemologically on the idea that human actions can best be understood through their economic foundations and consequences, and methodologically on the idea that the best and most accurate conclusions can be reached from a base of quantifiable and documented evidence. This strong epistemological and methodological base has resulted in a large body of excellent and rigorous work. Its focus on numbers and documents has, however, largely obscured the economic importance of cultivation carried out<br>

  Abstract: Although content analysis is used extensively in the field of communications, it has been applied only sporadically to broadcasting history. Most of the standard works on Canadian radio history are nationalistic in tone and make reference to the threat of American programming without quantifying its impact for assessment. Extensive content analysis of Canadian radio program schedules during the 1930s in Vancouver, Montreal, and Halifax questions some of the long-held historical misconceptions about Canadian radio.

  Abstract: Surprisingly and in repeatedly unexpected ways, historians have continued to debate in recent decades the central question of their craft: how can the past be described and explained? At each stage of the debate, the answers to this question have reflected and contributed to larger epistemological discussions across the disciplines. The following discussion examines selected aspects of the twists and turns of recent historical debate by using the example of research on census enumerations.

Although mentoring is becoming increasingly recognized as a significant aspect of both personal and professional development today, the mentoring-type relationship has existed in all of human history. This is well exemplified in the characters of Mentor and his mentee, Telemachus, in the ancient Greek story of
                  The Odyssey(Daloz, 1999, p. 17). In the past 25 years, there has been an increase in the use of formal mentoring programs in the workplace as well as in academic and professional<br>

  Abstract: This paper offers theoretical considerations of the ways in which literary postcoloniality in the teaching of Canadian literatures constitutes both a continuation of and a departure from the institutionalized history of literature as a key mode of delivery in civic education. To say that postcolonial pedagogy continues and departs from the institutionalization of literary studies is to say something of such obviousness that it would seem not to bear repeating, yet it is precisely to “the obvious” that pedagogy must attend insofar as both pedagogy and the obvious perform so much social—and so much complex—work.

  Author(s) MURRAY HEATHER<br>
  Abstract: Now that the “linguistic turn” has been replaced by an “historical turn,” it may seem unnecessary to argue for literary history as a mode of work. In recent years, English-Canadian literary criticism has been both deepened and enhanced by the wealth of writing (often by innovative junior scholars) on lesser-known authors and texts. (As a graduate student, I would have dated early Canadian literature as predating the Confederation poets; a student of today may well find Renaissance Canadian literature, or early Native discourses, a familiar terrain.) Literary work for English Canada is, by now, and by and large, historical in<br>

  Abstract: Postcolonial concerns are important to understanding the place of children’s literature in pedagogical and extracurricular pursuits. Peter Hulme has described “the classic colonial triangle … [as] the relationship between European, native and land” (qtd. in Bradford 196). In his view, territories, culture, and world-views are appropriated once certain tropes of superiority and dominion over “others” have been established by colonizers. It would be naive not to recognize that realistic animal tales for children were part of the discursive practice of colonialism in Canada’s history. These tales cohere around colonial constructs of dominion, had a significant role in the civilizing or<br>

  Author(s) Walters Gregory J.<br>
  Abstract: Within the history of Western ethics, we find both the teleological approach, exemplified by Aristotle’s ethics of virtues, and the deontological approach, heralded by Kant’s ethics of duty, rule-utilitarianism, and divine will/command conceptions of morality. Usually, we assume that these two approaches are incompatible and we must follow either the “good” or the “right.”¹ In this essay, I am concerned with what I believe is the most significant contemporary manifestation of the virtue-rights debate.

Major figures such as Gadamer and Merleau-Ponty¹ are well-known exponents of this view, and even circumspect and insightful subsequent scholars such as Carr tend to stress the novelty, for example, of the infusion of history into Husserl’s later philosophy² Some treat this ‘novelty’ as a reaction to the historical crisis of the 1930s, and also imply that the proximity and popularity of Heidegger should not be<br>

  Author(s) BANDIA PAUL F.<br>
  Abstract: It can be safely argued that over the last couple of decades the discipline of translation history has broadened its horizon beyond mainly Western traditions to include other histories and historical perspectives, thus ensuring pluralism as a basis for constituting a truly comprehensive history of translation. This has generally been a healthy response to Berman’s (1984) assertion that there can be no truly comprehensive theory of translation without a preliminary study of the many and varied histories of translating languages and cultures. It is therefore interesting to look at some of the ways in which translation history has managed to<br>

  Abstract: There is no doubt that history and translation are bound together. Translation represents not only a central process in historical work, but is, in itself, a historical practice. However, so far these ties have not forged connections across the two disciplines. It must be acknowledged that the difference between the status of translation and history in the research community is such that the use of translation by historians has long been considered “normal” and “natural,” while translators studying the history of their profession (so far of little interest to those who are historians by trade) are in general careful not<br>

For example, it is generally accepted that “the oldest known recorded evidence of legal translation is the Egyptian-Hittite Peace Treaty of 1271 BC” (Sarcevic 1997, 23). It would be both impossible and futile to try to pinpoint the reasons for this lack of interest.

  The Role of Translation in History: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpfkh">Charting the Future of Translation History</a><br>
  Author(s) ROSE MARILYN GADDIS<br>
  Abstract: Indeed, this is the desperation in historiography: whoever records the present may control the past and hence the future as well. How can we learn from history when the records have been falsified? Or erased? Especially when or where historiography as the West extols it is moot? The case of André Malraux (1900–1976) suggests that belles
                     lettres, rather than historiography, may preserve more reliable insights. Further, his translators, who expanded his reading audience, have kept the record accessible.<br>

  Abstract: The traditional history of Hebrew translation, as summarized in the Hebrew Encyclopaedia entry “Translation” (Toury 1980, 1063–1065), presented the progress of translation as an integral part of the revival of the Hebrew language, petrified by centuries of relying on written canonical sources only. It emphasized the vital role of translation in this revival, the different ways in which the translation laboratory<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ckpfkh">Charting the Future of Translation History</a><br>
  Author(s) GAGNON CHANTAL<br>
  Abstract: In Canadian history, many sociopolitical conflicts have arisen from the coexistence of two different peoples in a single land. For instance, one can think of Canada’s Conscription Crisis in 1942, its October Crisis in 1970, or its failure to conclude the Meech Lake Accord in 1990.¹ Rival nationalism is often called upon to explain these conflict situations between French and English Canadians. According to sociologists Bourque and Duchastel (1996, 315), until 1960 two nationalisms clashed with one another: that of the French community, based on the French-Canadian “race” and the Roman Catholic faith, and that of the English community, based<br>

  Book Title: Northrop Frye-New Directions from Old<br>
  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

  Abstract: I have a relatively clear memory of my first encounter with
                  Anatomy of Criticism. Browsing the shelves of the University of Chicago bookstore in the early 1960s, I picked up a copy of the book, not because anyone had recommended it but because it looked interesting. I had decided by then that I would be doing my degree in the history and theory of criticism, and leafing through this book made me think it worth looking into, though I did not actually read it until a couple of years later.

  Abstract: In “Averroes’ Search” Borges imaginatively reconstructs the effort of the greatest of the Western Muslim philosophers to deal with the
                  Poeticsof Aristotle.¹ Averroes’ commentaries on Aristotle were a powerful influence on Scholasticism, which means, of course, on the history of Western philosophy in general. But Averroes was dealing with an Aristotle in translation, an Aristotle, in fact, twice removed from Arabic, for Aristotle was first translated into Syriac by Christian Syrians and then into Arabic from the Syriac.² Knowing neither Greek nor Syriac, this monumental scholar, whom the Schoolmen honoured simply as the “the Commentator,” was twice removed from<br>

  CHAPTER 1  Kant’s Transcendental Problematic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6r4p">Apperception, Knowledge, and Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: A traditional way of introducing Kant to an audience somewhat familiar with the history of philosophy is to view him as attempting to synthesize the primary insights of Continental rationalism and British empiricism. Although this approach tends to downplay Kant’s genuine originality as a thinker, its virtue lies in the ready access it provides to many of the more technically difficult themes of Kant’s epistemology. And that is why I shall employ it in these brief introductory remarks.<br>

  Author(s): REID JENNIFER<br>
  Abstract: From the time of the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, people of British origin have shared the area of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, traditionally called Acadia, with Eastern Canada's Algonkian-speaking peoples, the Mi'kmaq. This historical analysis of colonial Acadia from the perspective of symbolic and mythic existence will be useful to those interested in Canadian history, native Canadian history, religion in Canada, and history of religion.<br>

  CONCLUSION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6rz3">Myth, Symbol, and Colonial Encounter</a><br>
  Abstract: I began this inquiry by noting that one or another form of alienation appears to have been the experience of all Acadia’s peoples. The bulk of this work has concerned itself with a search for the historical roots of alienation, but it may not have constituted a historical analysis in any familiar sense of the term, since it has consciously focussed upon human religiosity as that which gives meaning to history. History, like religion, is very much a product of the scholar’s own historical context as well as of the scholar’s purpose for writing. In that sense, this historical work<br>

  Abstract: Ingarden’s life and career spanned not only one of the greatest eras of European intellectual and cultural history but also the last chapters of one of the most tragic periods of the turbulent history of Poland, much of which revolved around Krakow, the city of his birth. Throughout the eighteenth century, Krakow had been repeatedly attacked, occupied, and plundered by the armies of Sweden, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and by the end of the century Poland had formally ceased to exist.

While on occasion he showed his awareness of political and social influences on the topic under discussion, it is clear throughout his work that his predominant focus was the influence of ideas and intellectual/spiritual movements in history.

(His writings about North American native religions came later and within the context of the ecological crisis.) Within the field of world religions he remained primarily a cultural historian, interested in the ideas and events that shaped human culture.

  Abstract: Theories of natural moral law have deep roots in our culture. They have emerged again and again in our western tradition, not, however, without important variations. They are less appealing in times of social and political stability than in times of social crisis. In times when man turns against man, voices are always raised to remind us that man by virtue of his very humanity has certain inalienable rights and certain absolute correlative obligations to his fellow man. Like Antigone, we appeal to moral laws that transcend an ethnocentric “closed morality” of social pressure. In our recent history, liberalism, both<br>

  Abstract: The context of this examination of history and/as intertext is what I see as the paradoxes, not to say contradictions, of what we seem to want to call “postmodernism” in both artistic practice and theoretical discourse. Postmodernism in both areas is fundamentally paradoxical: in both, we find masterful denials of mastery, totalizing negations of totalization. The conventions of discourse are used and abused, inscribed and subverted, asserted and denied. This is the context in which I want to look at what I see as the literary equivalent of postmodern architecture. What we usually label as postmodernist in literature today, though,<br>

Strauss of Tübingen a century and a half ago were largely accepted by jesus researchers and New Testament scholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. First, Strauss argued that the Jesus of history must be divorced from the Christ of faith. Second, given some irreconcilable differences between the synoptics and John, and the three-against-one reality, one must choose between the Synoptics<br>

  Abstract: Both narrative analysis as practiced by paul ricoeur (1983–1985) and the new approach to history as seen in Hayden White (1999) have emphasized the decisive hermeneutical role of plot in the construction of a story. In particular, the shaping of the plot in historiographical works allows the narrator to structure and contextualize the story and place it in a certain perspective (Bauckham 2007a; Luz 2009; Schmeller 2009). The creation of the plot is a central moment in the creation of meaning.<br>

  Abstract: Discussion of the Fourth Gospel, Jesus, and history invariably incorporates consideration of the temple incident. In general, the Synoptic Gospel version of the positioning of the incident has been given priority over that of the Fourth Gospel. In effect, we have an either/or discussion, a choice between the Fourth Gospel and the Synoptic Gospels as

  Abstract: It is the aim of the John, Jesus and History Project to reinvestigate the historical value of the Fourth Gospel and to question the allegedly critical consensus by which Johannine interpretation has been “dehistoricized” while the quest for the historical Jesus has been “de-johannified” (Anderson 2006b, 43– 100; 2007a, 3). A new search for elements of historical value in John appears warranted in view of the history of research, at least since the beginning of the twentieth century.

It has generated magisterial pronouncements, fulminated controversies that have fractured Christendom, and pitted religious orders against each other. Moreover, no commentator in whatever era can say anything meaningful about the subject without appealing to metaphysics, which finds little sympathy in today’s agnosticism about universal truth claims. The question thus arises: how is it currently possible for someone to address the<br>

  Abstract: The question of how and why readers would attribute an ethos to literary characters, narrators, or authors is part of the more general issue of how people make meaning from and with texts. Within the humanities, such issues are traditionally the province of hermeneutics, which encompasses the theory, the method (or the “art”), and the practice of interpreting texts. Alternately, interpretations and their underlying processes are studied from the perspective of literary and aesthetic phenomenology, the sociology of literature, discourse analysis, the reception history of literary works (

  Abstract: Structuralism, whatever that term may mean over a decade into the twenty-first century, is overdue for reassessment. The death of Claude Lévi-Strauss in 2009 provides the obligation as well as the opportunity to engage in such an exercise of historical retrospect. Lévi-Strauss moved with characteristic creative aplomb across a remarkable range of potential disciplinary homes, but anthropology remained his home base, the place of comfort from which to discomfit other disciplines. The history of anthropology therefore has a particular claim to the movement he founded and popularized beyond its origins in Saussurean linguistics despite the fact that French structuralism has<br>

  Abstract: Claude Lévi-Strauss is often accused of paying too little regard for history and human agency.

Indeed, both Burroughs (1837–1921) and Eiseley (1907–77) belong to a long list of writers who imaginatively delve into environmental explorations, forging connections to ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

  Author(s) Whiteley Peter M.<br>
  Abstract: In Hopi discourse, important ideas and processes involving cultural and historical order are localized and commemorated in the landscape and are indexed by place-names. Events happened at particular places: in Hopi oral history, knowing
                  wheresomething happened is an important part of knowingthatit happened. As texts, some named places are interconnected, while others are more independent (on related Pueblo geographic sensibilities, see, e.g., Harrington 1916; Ortiz 1969, 1972; Silko 1999). Some texts are sociological, others historical, some mythological, others political, economic, religious, or ecological (cf. Thornton 2008 on Tlingit place-names).

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

  Book Title: Phantom Past, Indigenous Presence-Native Ghosts in North American Culture and History<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska Paperback<br>
  Author(s): Thrush Coll<br>
  Abstract: Phantom Past, Indigenous Presenceexplores the importance of ancestral spirits and historic places in Indigenous and settler communities as they relate to territory and history-in particular cultural, political, social, historical, and environmental contexts. From examinations of how individuals reacted to historical cases of "hauntings," to how Native phantoms have functioned in the literature of North Americans, to interdisciplinary studies of how such beliefs and narratives allowed European settlers and Indigenous people to make sense of the legacies of colonialism and conquest, these essays show how the past and the present are intertwined through these stories.<br>

Can a single place be home to a certain kind of history, persistent and cohesive, even across boundaries of time and cultural regime? Can the nonhuman, in the form of organisms, climate, or other entities, define the shape of a place and even its meaning? Can remnants of past societies—ruins, ecological footprints, artifacts—“speak” in active ways for the histories they represent? And can we include<br>

  Book Title: Slavery's Capitalism-A New History of American Economic Development<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Rockman Seth<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the expertise of sixteen scholars who are at the forefront of rewriting the history of American economic development,
         Slavery's Capitalismidentifies slavery as the primary force driving key innovations in entrepreneurship, finance, accounting, management, and political economy that are too often attributed to the so-called free market. Approaching the study of slavery as the originating catalyst for the Industrial Revolution and modern capitalism casts new light on American credit markets, practices of offshore investment, and understandings of human capital. Rather than seeing slavery as outside the institutional structures of capitalism, the essayists recover slavery's importance to the American economic past and prompt enduring questions about the relationship of market freedom to human freedom.<br>

  Author(s) SCHERMERHORN CALVIN<br>
  Abstract: What is a slave ship? Such vessels are among the most emblematic features of slavery’s Atlantic history. Transatlantic slaving vessels were floating dungeons whose names evoke a “way of death,” illustrated by the iconic
                  Brooks, theZongmassacre, and theAmistaduprising. That “vast machine” was a race-making technology, a site of demonic cruelty, and an instrument of violence. Yet the slave ship looks different when viewed in its coastal U.S. configuration. Like their transatlantic and riverine counter parts, U.S. coastal slave ships were “floating engines of capitalism,” but in the 1810s and 1820s most ships plying the domestic saltwater<br>

While much has been said about these "geographies of pain," violence in the private sphere, particularly gendered violence, receives little attention. This book fills that void. It is a critical addition to the study of African and Caribbean women's literatures at a time when women from these regions are actively engaged in articulating the ways in which colonial and postcolonial violence impact women.<br>

Physical violence manifests itself in the enslavement and killing of Africans and in the dispossession of their continent; in the fights between masters and slaves, between colonized and colonizers, and among colonizers themselves; in abolitionist struggles; and in several postcolonial revolutionary wars (Corzani 15).

  Book Title: The Rhizomatic West-Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Tatum Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, Neil Campbell shows how the West (or west-ness) continually breaks away from a mainstream notion of American "rootedness" and renews and transforms itself in various cultural forms. A region long traversed by various transient peoples (from tribes and conquerors to immigrants, traders, and trappers), the West reflects a mythic quest for settlement, permanence, and synthesis-even notions of a national or global identity-at odds with its rootless history, culture, and nature. Crossing the concept of "roots" with "routes," this book shows how notions of the West-in representations ranging from literature and film to photography, music, and architectural theory-give expression to ideas about identity, nationhood, and belonging in a world increasingly defined by movement across time and borders.
      The Rhizomatic Westoffers a new vision of the American West as a hybrid, performative space, a staging place for myriad intersecting and constantly changing identities.<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

  Abstract: Speaking about writing, especially Chinese writing, entails thinking about the ways in which writing speaks to us through a variety of media and forms. Whether it be a consideration of the written character or its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing always appears in its multifarious guises to be much more than an embodiment of textuality. To reflect on this and related features of writing is the goal of this volume, as we consider a fundamental problem: What is the relationship of writing to materiality over the course of China’s literary history?

  Abstract: Jin Ping Mei cihua金瓶梅詞話 (hereafter,Jin Ping Mei), a late Ming novel about the rise and fall of the merchant Ximen, marks several important changes in the history of the Chinese novel.¹ First, it forged a new kind of narrative focused on a comprehensive range of quotidian experience, which had until then barely been treated on its own terms in the vernacular novel. Second, despite the novefs overall structural unity, the narrative often seems to take on the features of the experience it recounts, becoming just as detailed, kaleidoscopic, and fragmentary.

  Abstract: In 2004, during the rushed archeological work prior to the planned flooding of the Three Gorges region on the Yangzi River, excavators discovered a stele dated 173 ce and dedicated to a local prefect who had otherwise disappeared from history (Figure 1). In language common for such gravestones from the later years of the Han dynasty (202 bce–220 ce), the two-meter-high slab lavishly praised the administration of this minor official, named Jing Yun 景雲 (d. 103 ce).

  Book Title: Ancestral Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: Ancestral ritual in early China was an orchestrated dance between what was present (the offerings and the living) and what was absent (the ancestors). The interconnections among the tangible elements of the sacrifice were overt and almost mechanical, but extending those connections to the invisible guests required a medium that was itself invisible. Thus in early China, ancestral sacrifice was associated with focused thinking about the ancestors, with a structured mental effort by the living to reach out to the absent forebears and to give them shape and existence. Thinking about the ancestors—about those who had become distant—required active deliberation and meditation, qualities that had to be nurtured and learned. This study is a history of the early Chinese ancestral cult, particularly its cognitive aspects. Its goals are to excavate the cult’s color and vitality and to quell assumptions that it was no more than a simplistic and uninspired exchange of food for longevity, of prayers for prosperity. Ancestor worship was not, the author contends, merely mechanical and thoughtless. Rather, it was an idea system that aroused serious debates about the nature of postmortem existence, served as the religious backbone to Confucianism, and may even have been the forerunner of Daoist and Buddhist meditation practices.<br>

  Abstract: Based on a decade's work in Ginzburg's archives, the book discusses previously unknown manuscripts and uncovers a wealth of new information about the author's life, focusing on Ginzburg's quest for a new kind of writing adequate to her times. She writes of universal experiences-frustrated love, professional failures, remorse, aging-and explores the modern fragmentation of identity in the context of war, terror, and an oppressive state. Searching for a new concept of the self, and deeming the psychological novel (a beloved academic specialty) inadequate to express this concept, Ginzburg turned to fragmentary narratives that blur the lines between history, autobiography, and fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

  Author(s) ARZYUTOV DMITRY V.<br>
  Abstract: There are two reasons why a volume dedicated to the memory of George W. Stocking Jr. is, in our opinion, the most appropriate venue for this chapter. First, its American author studied with George at the University of Chicago and developed a strong interest in the history of anthropology under his influence.¹ It was Stocking who encouraged him to take advantage of his knowledge of Russian and explore the history of the relationship between Boas and his Russian colleagues, such as Vladimir Bogoraz and Lev Shternberg.

  Author(s) Haase Donald<br>
  Abstract: It’s about time. Time , that is, for a collection of essays like this. Time for scholars of folktales and fairy tales to acknowledge the role that teaching plays in their work. The study of folktales and fairy tales has a long history that took a radical turn in the 1970s and ’80s, a turn that reinvented, revitalized, and expanded the field across disciplines. That burgeoning interest generated new university courses on fairy tales that over the last thirty years have introduced countless students to a new, critical understanding of the fairy tale and to a host of new tales,<br>

  Abstract: One of my German students once stumbled upon several fairy-tale film adaptations by the
                  Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft(DEFA), the stateowned film studio of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), and inquired: “Are these movies very different from the Grimms’ original fairy tales?” This question inspired me to design a German fairy-tale class that ties students’ interest in fairy tales and films to a significant and fascinating part of Germany’s recent history. Although the Grimms’Märchen(fairy tales) are firmly embedded in courses and syllabi in German language, literature, folklore, culture, history, narrative theory, and fairy-tale studies, they are rarely discussed in<br>

  Abstract: First,

  Abstract: One of many debts of gratitude that biblical scholars owe Jim Flanagan is for the time and energy he has spent organizing us to think seriously about space in the same critical way we have become accustomed to thinking about history and society. My own interests are less systematically theoretical than Flanagan’s. Not only do I like my theory heavily applied; I do not even mind if an application skews someone’s theoretical system a bit. In the end, for me, heuristic possibility counts for more than theoretical purity. I have no doubt that some impurity will taint my neophyte venture<br>

Neither can they be reduced to a set of concepts that one would be able to define and use elsewhere. This is because in his theory of the arts there are no transhistorical constants that give sense to the history of forms.

  Author(s) Iso Naoki<br>
  Abstract: In this essay, we examine the history of the Japanese reception of Pierre Bourdieu’s works generally, and his essays on Japan specifically, from the viewpoints of the principle of differentiation and the concept of capital, both regarding international knowledge transfer (Robbins 2012).¹ The Japanese modernization and industrialization processes are always embedded within a unique knowledge transfer process. Japanese modernization processes, especially during the Meiji era, are often identified as

Take, for example, the “Southern Hospitality Experience” program developed in 2006 by

  Book Title: Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Abstract: Read, glossed, cited, and paraphrased, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s
                  Royal Commentaries(1609) have enjoyed enormous acclaim from readers since their first appearance at the beginning of the seventeenth century.¹ The existence of numerous translations into most modern languages proves their success in Europe. Several factors explain this fact: the socioethnic background of the author, the literary quality of the work, the nature of the sources consulted for its composition, and the fact that until late into the nineteenth century it would remain the only published text solely dedicated to the topic of Incan history.

  Author(s) Leiva Wendy P.<br>

Up to the late nineteenth century, Garcilaso’s account had been taken as the most accomplished historical depiction of the Inca, but the discovery of new written and archeological sources and the emergence of modern historiography source criticism led historians and anthropologists to challenge its truthfulness. As a result, Garcilaso’shistorylost credibility. At the same time, thenarrativewas hailed as possessing the<br>

  Abstract: Even a superficial reading of the Gospels will suffice to convince the reader that incarnation is the alpha and—as resurrection of the flesh—the omega of Christian faith. And with the body, involvement in the human world and its history is part of God’s self-revelation in his Word through the Spirit. The Christian community, whose faith is corporeal, communicative, communitarian, and sacramental, participates in this involvement. None of its activities is possible in the ether of incorporeal ghosts or spirits. All prophecies and fulfillments are facts of language; the entire liturgy is visible, tactile, and resounding; rituals have the<br>

In contrast to those of his colleagues in theology and philosophy who proclaim at every turn that the human mind cannot know God, let alone prove his existence, Hegel agrees with Anselm that genuine faith not merely pennits but requires the believer to seek to understand what he believes. 2. According to Hegel, Anselm’s proof of the existence of God, presented in<br>

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

  Abstract: Style has been a feature of the study of the Fourth Gospel for a long time. It has rarely been examined on its own terms, however; primarily, it has been used in a supporting function within source-critical research. This application of style focuses upon identifying and demarcating sources in and behind the text in its current form. The idea is that some parts of the Fourth Gospel exhibit a style that is inconsistent with the prevalent style of the Fourth Evangelist. In the history of source criticism, stylistic features have thus been used to prove (or, by critics, to disprove)<br>

It is probably the only representation in all of European prehistory which shows a woman actually giving birth — a mind-boggling fact when one considers, as Mark Twain remarked, that being born is one of the few universal human experiences.

  Book Title: Assia Djebar-Out of Algeria<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FORSDICK CHARLES<br>
  Abstract: For more than fifty years, Assia Djebar, former Silver Chair of French at New York University and winner of the Neustadt Prize for Contribution to World Literature, used the tools of poetry, fiction, drama and film to vividly portray the world of Muslim women in all its complexity. In the process, she became one of the most important figures in North African literature. In
      Assia Djebar, Jane Hiddleston traces Djebar's development as a writer against the backdrop of North Africa's tumultuous history. Whereas Djebar's early writings were largely an attempt to delineate clearly the experience of being a woman, an intellectual, and an Algerian embedded in that often violent history, she had in her more recent work evinced a growing sense that the influence of French culture on Algerian letters may make such a project impossible. The first book-length study of this significant writer,Assia Djebarwill be of tremendous interest to anyone studying post-colonial literature, women's studies or Francophone culture in general.<br>

  Abstract: Assia Djebar: Out of Algeriais a book about expatriation, and the constant, necessary revisiting that follows. Algeria remains a focus, an object of desire throughout Djebar’s corpus, but it is also a point of departure, and excludes the writer more often than it grounds or defines her. Her only locus of identification or belonging, Algeria is at the same time figured as broken, war-torn, unfamiliar and irrevocably lost. A potential symbol of difference in contradistinction to colonial influence, Djebar’s Algeria is also diverse, divided and ultimately destroyed. Driven by the urge to recover her country’s history, Djebar repeatedly returns<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  The Early Years from:

  Abstract: Assia Djebar wrote four novels during the first phase of her career between 1957 and 1967. After leaving the Ecole normale supérieure at Sèvres during the war of independence, she worked for the national newspaper
                  El moudjahidconducting interviews with Algerian refugees in Tunis and Morocco, before going on to teach history in Rabat and later in Algiers. The novels consist at this stage in a form of experimentation, and the period can be seen as one of apprenticeship in the strategies and techniques of writing. At times highly naive and a little self-indulgent, Djebar’s early novels set out to<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Feminism and Women’s Identity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6bp9">Assia Djebar</a><br>
  Abstract: The notion of womanhood or femininity occupies a fraught position in Djebar’s work. She is on the one hand clearly preoccupied with Algerian women’s particular experiences, narrating numerous scenes of female oppression and liberation occurring at different moments in the history of the country. She sets out to retrieve suppressed feminine voices as she reflects on the relation between women and writing, and on the importance of creating a sense of agency through self-expression. On the other hand, however, Djebar also unsettles the very category of femininity, dissociating herself from women’s writing movements and contesting the validity of any specified<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: Djebar’s trajectory and development as a writer can be conceived as a gradual movement away from any specific form of identification with Algeria towards a new configuration of her native land as severed, diverse and haunted by its past. The lingering traces of a search for the specific in the earlier works give way, by the time of
                  La Femme sans sépultureandLa Disparition, to a depiction of Algeria’s culture, language and history as intractable or spectral – present but impossible to grasp. It is in this sense that her writing constitutes a hesitant ‘expatriation’, a movement outside the<br>

  Abstract: The relationship with the past is one of the most fraught aspects in the negotiation of a postcolonial identity, and indeed history is frequently figured in postcolonial writing as a restraining or a restrictive force. For Joyce’s Stephen Dedalus history, famously, is the nightmare from which he wants to awake, while Salman Rushdie’s Saleem Sinai describes himself as being ‘handcuffed to history’ on the opening page of
                  Midnight’s Children. Such images of entrapment or restraint testify to the oppressive ‘presentness’ of the past in the postcolonial imaginary. As we have already seen, in the context of the Caribbean – where<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gn6dst">Patrick Modiano</a><br>
  Abstract: Modiano is still best known for writing novels set in the Occupation. His apparent obsession, especially in his earlier works, with this dark period of French history has been the main concern of his critics and reviewers. It is certainly a controversial subject: it was one of the main causes for the impact that Modiano’s first novels had on the public, instantly creating a reputation for the young author.¹ We may wonder, however, whether there was more to this reaction than that of simple choice of subject matter. What is the nature of Modiano’s treatment of the subject? Is it<br>

  Book Title: At the Limits of Memory-Legacies of Slavery in the Francophone World<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hodgson Kate<br>
  Abstract: Recent years have seen a growing body of literature dedicated to memories of slavery in the Anglophone world, yet little has been done to approach this subject from Francophone perspectives. This collection responds to the urgent need to contribute to current research on slavery and memory studies by focusing specifically on the Francophone world. Featuring the scholarship of leading academics in France, Britain, the United States and Canada, the collection reflects upon contemporary commemorative practices that relate to the history of slavery and the slave trade, and questions how they function in relationship to other, less memorialized histories of exploitation, such as indentured and forced labour. The volume is set against the context of France’s growing body of memory legislation, as well as its close cultural and political connections to its former empire, all of which make it an influential player in how slavery continues to be memorialized and conceptualized in the public sphere. Contributors retrace and redraw the narrative map of slavery and its legacies in the Francophone world through a comparative understanding of how these different, but interconnected forms of labour exploitation have been remembered and/or forgotten from European, West African, Indian Ocean and Caribbean perspectives.<br>

  Multiple Memories: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1gpcb4p">At the Limits of Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Ravi Srilata<br>
  Abstract: The history of Mauritius, an island with no indigenous populations, is the history of sequential colonialisms and successive immigrations. The Portuguese are credited with the discovery of Mauritius in the early sixteenth century, but they showed little interest in colonizing the island. The Dutch came later, but were unsuccessful in their efforts to found a colony. After their withdrawal in 1710, French colonists, adventurers and merchants transformed the island into a prosperous and flourishing sugarcane-producing colony with the help of slaves who came mainly from Madagascar and East Africa (Addison and Hazareesingh, 1999: 25). General Decaen’s capitulation in 1810 transformed<br>

  Author(s) Griffiths Claire<br>
  Abstract: As memories of slavery re-emerge in recent historiographies of the transatlantic slave trade, contemporary visual culture from Francophone Africa is participating in this reassessment of the past as part of an on-going discussion of ‘development’ in present-day Africa. By engaging with the history of the slave trade and exploring its connections with the use of African labour in contemporary modes of production in West Africa, recent art works from the region that once formed the heartland of the French slave trade can be seen to offer a discursive platform on which to foreground ‘alternative memorial practices and forms of memory-making’<br>

  Author(s) Vergès Françoise<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1960s in Martinique, French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Réunion, and since 1998 in metropolitan France, memories of the slave trade and colonial slavery have mobilized associations, artists and scholars. After a long period of marginalization in French history and culture, colonial slavery has become a point of reference for the women, children and men who identify with those who were enslaved in the French colonies. It has been used to question the French national narrative and its pervasive inequalities, to explore the role and place of racial thinking in the making of French society and culture, and to analyse<br>

  Abstract: Although often overlooked, a passage from Marx’s

In this work, a theoretical perspective is opened, which I define as the “contingency of antagonism” – an Adornian concept. I will argue: (a) that this is an original perspective, irreducible to any previous philosophical positions, (b) that Marx’s intuition finds a more sophisticated reformulation in Adorno, and (c) that the idea of a contingent antagonism can provide a key to overcome the apparently antinomical outcome of negative dialectic.

  Abstract: The idea of the tragic has permeated Western culture for millennia, and has been expressed theatrically since the time of the ancient Greeks. However, it was in the Europe of the twentieth century – one of the most violent periods of human history – that the tragic form significantly developed. ‘Modern European Tragedy’ examines the consciousness of this era, drawing a picture of the development of the tragic through an in-depth analysis of some of the twentieth century’s most outstanding texts.<br>

  Abstract: Human liberation has been a key concern with humanity from the dawn of history, and in the contemporary moment, it manifests before us as an epochal challenge, as the prevalent guarantors of liberation in modernity – liberalism and socialism – have left us alone in the street. The dead end at which our familiar projects of social emancipation and human freedom are at present urges us to rethink liberation as part of a new seeking, striving, and experimental subjectivity at the level of both self and society.

  Abstract: The concept of rationality has been subjected to numerous critiques in the history of modernity, and all these critiques have been helpful in opening rationality to crosscultural translations and examinations. Despite numerous anthropological critiques of a Eurocentric notion of rationality which looks at other people such as the tribal people having a primitive mind, a modernistic and West-centric view of rationality is still very much on the throne. This situation seems to be slightly altering in the realm of philosophical discourse with some recent foundational interrogations of rationality offered by thinkers such as alasdair macIntyre and Stephen Toulmin, who urge<br>

And what potential contribution can intellectuals make to it? This last question is the one that I would like to address here, taking Bourdieu’s own answers to it as my starting point.

On the one hand, while the era of the Communist politics of history seems to be over forever, this is precisely why the monument’s megalomaniac attempt to reinterpret the national past may seem familiar to us.

  Abstract: A vital factor in any attempt to interpret Pg as a whole is the question of its nature or genre.¹ However, how exactly to describe the nature of the Priestly material (Pg) has proven to be an elusive task. The Priestly material has been described in various ways; it has been described as “

  Book Title: Light and Death-Figuration in Spenser, Kepler, Donne, Milton<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Anderson Judith H.<br>
  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

In manner, the chapter is historical, analytical, and abstract, in effect a further shift. These changes threaten to confirm the very chasm between science and the humanities against which I argue. Yet my first three chapters have treated matters that relevantly recur in this one, such as physical and intellectual vision, body and mind, imagination, knowledge, figurative illumination, and Neoplatonism. More importantly, the argument of this chapter enables a theorized broadening<br>

  Abstract: There are idealist views of philosophy that see it as an affirmation of the autonomy of a thinking subject. As the primary instrument of this absolute subject, philosophy shares in its autonomy and therefore is a discipline that rises above the determinations of history and everyday life. The distinguishing characteristics of Afro-Caribbean philosophy do not support this view. Here we find a tradition of philosophy so indelibly marked by the forces of an imperial history, and by its intertextual relations with neighboring discourses, that it is necessary to begin with a general characterization of philosophy that is more appropriate to<br>

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of keywords in and contributors to this volume, please go to: http://ow.ly/4mZZxV<br>

Perhaps the animal is too close to us to be recognized: animals may be “good to think” (Levi-Strauss 1991, 89), but the immediacy of their energy seems to make them difficult to think
                     about. Reading animals into the history of energy might require us to begin at a distance, asking first when and how we have used animal energy, before we can see what it is and what it means to us.<br>

But in the field of psychology, the term has a more turbulent history. Often thought in a tandem with kinesthetics, innervation can be found in early psychological studies of the articular, tendinous, and muscular complexes (Baldwin 1960, 549). Since its inception, innervation has generally been regarded as a mode of energy transfer or conversion—and therefore a process of stimulation, in stark distinction to its current neurophysiological definition<br>

Solar energy is imagined as fundamentally heterogeneous, characterized by how it precipitates complex transactions and conversions that nonetheless preserve homeostatic LIMITS.

Stemming from this sense of closure, its disgruntled tone suggests an insubordination later elaborated in Caliban’s plan to murder Prospero and burn his books. Such acts of defiance have made Caliban, as Jonathan Goldberg says, “a byword for anticolonial riposte” (2004, ix). But what of the wood? This question may seem slight when weighed against empire and resistance to it, but Caliban uncovers the indispensability<br>

  Book Title: Supper at Emmaus-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): OLSEN GLENN W.<br>
  Abstract: Supper at Emmaus traces various important intellectual topics from the ancient world to the modern period. Generally, as in its treatment of the question of whether the long-standing contrast between cyclical and linear views of history is helpful, it introduces important thinkers who have considered the question. A preoccupation of the book is the appearance and reappearance across the centuries of patterns used to organize temporal and cultural experience. After an opening essay on transcendental truth and cultural relativism, the second chapter traces a distinction, common in historical writings during the past two centuries, between an alleged ancient classical "cyclic" view of time and history, used to describe the claimed repetitiveness of and similarities between historical events ("nothing is new under the sun"), and a contrasting Jewish-Christian linear view, sometimes described as providential in that it moves through a series of unique events to some end intended by God. In the latter, history is "about something," the education of the human race or the redemption of humankind. As in each of the remaining essays, the book then attempts to draw out the limitations of what the current consensus on this topic has become. It does this for such things as our current understanding of religious toleration, humanism, natural law, and teleology. Some of the essays, such as those on debate about Augustine's understanding of marriage or the concluding illustrated essay on the baroque city of Lecce, are published for the first time. Others are based on previously published contributions to the scholarly literature, though generally each of these chapters concludes with a postscript that engages with current scholarly debate on the subject.<br>

  Abstract: That marvelous venture in cross-cultural study,
                  Eranos, devoted its 1951 meeting to the theme “Man and Time.”¹ When the papers given at this meeting were translated and published in English, they were introduced by a short essay, “The Time of Eranos,” by Henry Corbin.² In a few pages Corbin launched a frontal assault on some of the most cherished assumptions of the history profession—indeed, on the very idea of “explanation” as it occurs across the sciences today. His analysis seems to me so correct and freighted with such significance that I would like to devote this chapter to explaining,<br>

  FIVE  Setting Boundaries: from:

  Abstract: The history of toleration has no beginning. Tolerance and intolerance, the instincts to welcome and to exclude, have been practiced by each individual and every people. From its beginnings Judaism regarded itself as the religion of a chosen people that drew lines of separation between itself and others (especially in the matter of purity) while also welcoming the stranger. Christianity and Islam acted similarly. This chapter explores particular ways in which Judaism’s approach to the problem of tolerating those with whom it could not comfortably live a shared life influenced its daughter faiths, especially Christianity.<br>

Essentially at first a narrative to explain the gloriousness of the Glorious Revolution of 1688—that is, the triumph of Protestantism and parliamentarianism over Catholicism and monarchy—the narrative has been quite adaptive and has been a carrier of a tale of progress built around the desirability of commerce, money-making, science, technology, and democracy.

Why do we do anthropology? In this chapter we shall consider human nature from the standpoint of history: what different philosophies and religions have said of the human being. G. K.

That human sociality has been considered throughout the history of anthropology as something deeply ambivalent, however, is undeniable. In this chapter we shall attempt to describe certain moments of this history of the reality and ambivalence of the social condition. Then we shall consider how the fact of human sociality and its dynamism may be interpreted in the light of faith in order to understand its origin, purpose, and inner meaning.

  Abstract: The problem is, surely, how to address redress with adequate justice. Redress assumes, not a saving intervention that might prevent acts of violence and expropriation in the present, but an address to the past from which we are disjoined by the very history of which effective violence is a constitutive part. In relation to the violence of the past, we seem helpless, impotent to set right the injustice that has so forcefully shaped the very times that we inhabit.

The death of Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork, on October 25, 1920, the seventy-fourth day of his hunger strike in England’s Brixton prison, spurred an unprecedented level of collective mourning in the Irish diaspora; as such, it remains a unique event in Irish and Irish American history.

  Abstract: One of Ireland’s earliest texts is the
                  Book of Invasions, which records a genealogy of incursion and settlement for early Ireland. Already present is a mixing of history—telling itas it happened—and fiction—telling itas if it happened: for in those ancient times the boundary between empirical fact and cultural imagination was often blurred. When a manuscript begins with the words “In Illo tempore,” “In the Old days,” “Fado Fado,” one is already encountering a particular narrative take on the legacy of the past.

Its system, buildings, and sites comprise a challenging representational struggle between erasure and reconstruction in remembrance. Workhouses took years to build, employed thousands in the building process, subsequently housed hundreds of thousands from 1840s onward and yet remain a quiet aspect of Famine memory in visual and material culture.¹ The absence of extensively conserved workhouses is a consequence of life going on after the Famine, as some sites became utilized for different purposes and others succumbed to politically motivated destruction.² Workhouses have<br>

  Abstract: Since the 1994 paramilitary ceasefires, the Irish peace process has stimulated a flowering of practices of history-making, remembrance, and commemoration concerned with the legacy of the Troubles in “post-conflict” Northern Ireland.¹ Much of this work has taken the form of oral-history and life-history narrative that enables personal reflection on the significance of violent conflict in the recent past and reassessment of its impact upon individuals, families, and local areas.

The word that sparks this essay is “retained” rather than the inherently grander claims of Brodsky’s statement, claims that one can only fully understand and relate to the traditions of Russian poetry, instead of the slightly more moderate preoccupations of contemporary poetry in English.

However, if Stephen’s consciousness of the nightmare denotes a degree of agency and alludes to the potential for emancipation through awakening, Leerssen’s description evokes the feeling of utter powerlessness symptomatic of trauma (see Herman<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-Diaspora and Memory Practices, Volume 2<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: In the second volume of a series that will ultimately include four, the authors consider Irish diasporic memory and memory practices. While the Irish diaspora has become the subject of a wide range of scholar­ship, there has been little work focused on its relationship to memory. The first half of the volume asks how diasporic memory functions in dif­ferent places and times, and what forms it takes on. As an island nation with a history of emigration, Ireland has developed a rich diasporic cultural memory, one that draws on multiple traditions and his­toriographies of both "home" and "away." Native traditions are not imported wholesale, but instead develop their own curious hybridity, reflecting the nature of emigrant memory that absorbs new ways of thinking about home. How do immigrants remember their homeland? How do descendants of immigrants "remem­ber" a land they rarely visit? How does diasporic memory pass through families, and how is it represented in cultural forms such as literature, festivals, and souvenirs?<br>

  Author(s) BROWN KATIE<br>
  Abstract: Ireland, with its reputation as the “Land of Song,” is the only country in the world to have a musical instrument as its national symbol. It is thus not surprising that music is so intimately involved in the collective remembering of events in Irish history. When in the eighteenth century a decline in the numbers of Irish speakers occurred, the Irish language could no longer serve to transmit cultural memory as it once had; during this period, music became central to national expression. Charles Hamilton Teeling, a member of the United Irishmen, noted that throughout the time surrounding the 1798<br>

  Author(s) COLEMAN STEVE<br>
  Abstract: “Sound,” the American composer Morton Feldman wrote, “does not know its history” (2000, 22). Feldman’s statement captures a particularly modernist approach to the material aspect of art: in the case of music, sound is to be encountered as a thing in itself, without any immediate connection to exterior meaning or reality. The desire for the experience of pure artistic form implies its converse, also desired, in which art is experienced as an object in time, linked to tradition and occasion. To set these two aspects of artistic experience against one another is the hallmark of the modern sensibility. Modernity, as<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: James Joyce’s relation to “cultural memory” is inordinately complex. Joyce’s texts have come to be seen as embodying and somehow representing both memory and history, particularly in an Irish context, but also in an international one. When considered individually but especially as a collective, Joyce’s works function as narratives of the gigantic, in Susan Stewart’s phrase (Stewart 1994), that have consumed not just the particular periods in which they are set, not only whole swathes of Irish history and culture, but have come to function as digestives of world histories, languages, cultures: so that what we confront is the notion<br>

  Author(s) PLATT LEN<br>
  Abstract: Joyce scholars have always been interested in situating Joyce in historical context, but only since the late 1980s has the “Joyce and History” formulation become central. In part, this turn toward “history” has been philosophical. Less concerned with Joyce as a historical subject, the American academy in the 1980s and early 1990s produced a Joyce engaged with the subject of history—that is with history as historiography. Such critics as Robert Spoo and James Fairhall, then, constructed a Joyce preoccupied with history as ideological formation, particularly in relation to the orthodoxies of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historiography (Fairhall 1993;<br>

  Author(s) JONES ELLEN CAROL<br>
  Abstract: Borrowing and disjoining the language of the past, James Joyce’s work both parodies that past and bears witness to its truth.¹ To bear witness to the past is to comprehend its spectral repetition in the present. Indeed, even if acts of historical retrieval are intended to serve also as gestures of psychic restitution, the net effect of such reiterative reworkings of history is a repetition of the same in nightmarish, spectral,

The burden of being a Trocmé, however, was not Paul Trocmé’s invention, for he had a father (Eugène) who in turn had a father (Jean-Pierre Eugène), and each one laid that burden of family reputation on the next. It seemed to them all that being a Trocmé involved a responsibility to history as well as to family. For hundreds of years, Trocmé fathers had been laying down expectations for their sons, and it was no different<br>

  Book Title: Memory Ireland-History and Modernity, Volume 1<br>
  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frawley Oona<br>
  Abstract: Despite the ease with which scholars have used the term "memory" in recent decades, its definition remains enigmatic. Does cultural memory rely on the memories of individuals, or does it take shape beyond the borders of the individual mind? Cultural memory has garnered particular attention within Irish studies. With its trauma-filled history and sizable global diaspora, Ireland presents an ideal subject for work in this vein. What do stereotypes of Irish memory—as extensive, unforgiving, begrudging, but also blank on particular, usually traumatic, subjects—reveal about the ways in which cultural remembrance works in contemporary Irish culture and in Irish diasporic culture? How do icons of Irishness—from the harp to the cottage, from the Celtic cross to a figure like James Joyce—function in cultural memory? This collection seeks to address these questions as it maps a landscape of cultural memory in Ireland through theoretical, historical, literary, and cultural explorations by top scholars in the field of Irish studies. In a series that will ultimately include four volumes, the sixteen essays in this first volume explore remembrance and forgetting throughout history, from early modern Ireland to contemporary multicultural Ireland. Among the many subjects addressed: Guy Beiner disentangles "collective" from "folk" memory in "Remembering and Forgetting the Irish Rebellion of 1798," and Anne Dolan looks at local memory of the civil war in "Embodying the Memory of War and Civil War." The volume concludes with Alan Titley’s "The Great Forgetting," a compelling argument for viewing modern Irish culture as an artifact of the Europeanization of Ireland and for bringing into focus the urgent need for further, wide-ranging Irishlanguage scholarship.<br>

  Author(s) FRAWLEY OONA<br>
  Abstract: While terms like “memory,” “cultural memory,” and their variants frequently occur in the discourses of Irish literature, culture, and history, “memory” has remained largely undefined, addressed laterally. That the field of Irish studies has thus far failed adequately to define memory is hardly surprising, since those who have made memory their lifework experience similar problems. Memory, as the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio points out, is particularly elusive. “We are not conscious,” he writes, “of which memories we store and which memories we do not; of how we store memories; of how we classify and organize them; of how we interrelate memories<br>

  Abstract: The harp image encompasses distinct and sometimes conflicting iconographical histories and cultural “memories” that influenced the complex formation of Irish identity.

The Great Rebellion of 1798, which was the bloodiest outburst of violence in late-modern Irish history and inflicted lingering traumas, stands out in the commemorative culture of modern Ireland as a landmark that cast long shadows. Although the leadership of the United Irishmen, the revolutionary secret society behind the Rebellion, were lionized as the iconic founding fathers of Irish republicanism, militant republicans did not have a monopoly on the interpretation of the historical events.

  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  Book Title: Disability Rhetoric-  Publisher: Syracuse University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolmage Jay Timothy<br>
  Abstract: Disability Rhetoric is the first book to view rhetorical theory and history through the lens of disability studies. Traditionally, the body has been seen as, at best, a rhetorical distraction; at worst, those whose bodies do not conform to a narrow range of norms are disqualified from speaking. Yet, Dolmage argues that communication has always been obsessed with the meaning of the body and that bodily difference is always highly rhetorical. Following from this rewriting of rhetorical history, he outlines the development of a new theory, affirming the ideas that all communication is embodied, that the body plays a central role in all expression, and that greater attention to a range of bodies is therefore essential to a better understanding of rhetorical histories, theories, and possibilities.<br>

All share a number of common features. They are collective movements, drawing people together in a common belief and often a common cause. They depend on what are known as millennial or millenarian beliefs-the idea that the world<br>

  19  The Double Love Command and the Ethics of Religious Pluralism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jktq08">Love and Christian Ethics</a><br>
  Author(s) GREGORY ERIC<br>
  Abstract: It would be impossible to tell the history of modern Christian ethics without paying attention to the ways in which the realities of diversity have shaped its concerns. In a theological register, responses to these realities have run the gamut from lamenting an existential threat to celebrating a providential gift. Biblical narratives, from Babel to Pentecost, are marshaled for each approach (cf., e.g., Gen. 11; Rom. 12; 1 Cor. 12; Rev. 7). What cannot be denied is the extent to which recognition of diversity has sponsored and determined much of the intellectual agenda of the discipline known as “Christian ethics.”<br>

  3  Finding Jesus in the Old Testament: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv00">The Crucifixion of the Warrior God</a><br>
  Abstract: Although the individual authors of the NT display a range of perspectives on Jesus, we saw in the previous chapter that the NT as a whole understands Jesus to be the supreme revelation of God that culminates and supersedes all others.³ While most Bible interpreters throughout church history have acknowledged this and have thus held that all Scripture bears witness to Christ, it is my conviction that this insight has not been applied in a thorough and consistent manner. And, as I mentioned in the introduction, the primary evidence of this is that after the fifth century, no attempts have<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv00">The Crucifixion of the Warrior God</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the previous two chapters, I have argued that the NT as well as the church throughout history has to one degree or another advocated for a Christocentric approach to the OT. While the entire Bible is “God- breathed,” it is not to be interpreted in a flat way (viz. as if every part of it was equally authoritative for us). Rather, since Jesus culminates and supersedes all previous divine revelations, the OT must be interpreted in the light of him, never placed alongside of him as though it was a supplementary revelation. Indeed, I have argued that if we<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv00">The Crucifixion of the Warrior God</a><br>
  Abstract: The problem of relating the Old and New Testaments is as old as the church itself, and the incongruity of the OT’s violent divine portraits with the nonviolent, self-sacrificial, enemy-embracing agape -love of God revealed in the crucified Christ represents the apex of this challenge. The various responses to this problem that theologians have proposed throughout history can be broadly grouped into three categories. The first proposal, to be addressed in this chapter, was put forth by a second-century preacher named Marcion. He was uniformly branded a heretic by the proto-orthodox theologians of the time because he solved the problem<br>

  Book Title: Memories of Asaph-Mnemohistory and the Psalms of Asaph<br>
  Publisher: Fortress Press<br>
  Author(s): Jacobson Karl N.<br>
  Abstract: Although the Psalms of Asaph (Pss. 50, 73‒83) contain a concentration of historical referents unparalleled in the Psalter, they have rarely attracted sustained historical interest. Karl N. Jacobson identifies these Psalms as containing cultic historiography, historical narratives written for recitation in worship, and explores them through mnemohistory, attending to how the past is remembered and to the rhetorical function of recitation in the cultic setting. Asaph “remembers" the past as a movement from henotheism to Yahwism as the core memory that informs a new historical situation for worship participants.<br>

  1  Introduction and History of Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv1h">Memories of Asaph</a><br>
  Abstract: The biblical psalms attributed to Asaph (Psalms 50, 73–83) exhibit the most concentrated collection of historical referents in the Psalter. These historical referents, embodied in the Asaphite collection, serve as the marshals of Israel’s historical memory and establish a cultic framework in which Israel’s memory is formed, its history represented, and its identity shaped. My contention is that the historical material in these psalms, paired as it is with a broad vocabulary of remembrance, is a form of cultic historiography that is principally attested in Asaph and is distinctive of the Psalter.<br>

  Book Title: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrative-  Publisher: Ohio State University Press<br>
  Author(s): RICHARDSON BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativeoffers a collection of foundational essays introducing the reader to the full scope of unnatural narrative theory: its meaning, its goals, its extent, its paradoxes. This volume brings together a distinguished group of international critics, scholars, and historians that includes several of the world's leading narrative theorists. Together, they survey many basic areas of narrative studies from an unnatural perspective: story, time, space, voice, minds, narrative levels, "realism," nonfiction, hyperfiction, and narrative poetry. Rarely have these fundamental concepts been subjected to such an original and thoroughgoing reconceptualization. Much of the book is directed toward an investigation of experimental and antirealist work. Each essay focuses on texts and episodes that narrative theory has tended to neglect, and each provides theoretical formulations that are commensurate with such exceptional, albeit neglected, works.A Poetics of Unnatural Narrativearticulates and delineates the newest and most radical movement in narrative studies. This anthology will be of great interest to students and scholars of narrative studies and of the history and theory of modern fiction.<br>

  Book Title: Postclassical Narratology-Approaches and Analyses<br>
  Publisher: Ohio State University Press<br>
  Author(s): FLUDERNIK MONIKA<br>
  Abstract: Postclassical narratology has reached a new phase of consolidation but also continued diversification. This collection therefore discriminates between what one could call a critical but frame-abiding and a more radical frame-transcending or frame-shattering handling of the structuralist paradigm. Postclassical Narratology: Approaches and Analyses discusses a large variety of different aspects of narrative, such as extensions of classical narratology, new generic applications (autobiography, oral narratives, poetry, painting, and film), the history of narratology, the issue of fictionality, the role of cognition, and questions of authorship and authority, as well as thematic matters related to ethics, gender, and queering. Additionally, it uses a wide spectrum of critical approaches, including feminism, psychoanalysis, media studies, the rhetorical theory of narrative, unnatural narratology, and cognitive studies. In this manner the essays manage to produce new insights into many key issues in narratology.<br>

  7  Sapphic Dialogics: from:

  Author(s) LANSER SUSAN S.<br>
  Abstract: Literary critics have long acknowledged that form is (a kind of) content and, as such, socially meaningful. Even scholars whose focus is hermeneutic rather than poetic cannot wholly escape attending to the formal elements that shape—and arguably
                  are—the text. It would seem, then, that narratologists and interpreters of narrative would acknowledge considerable common ground. Yet the relationship between narratology and studies of the novel—to take one example—still remains something of a standoff, and nowhere more vividly than on the turf of history. As Monika Fludernik observes, narratologists have demonstrated “comparatively little interest on a theoretical level<br>

  Author(s) Schloesser Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Although it has been twenty-five years since Linda Schlafer investigated the seminal importance of Flannery O’Connor’s encounter with the work of Léon Bloy (1846–1917), scholars have been slow to follow her lead.² Yet Bloy’s literary style, indelibly marked by rhetorical violence and vitriolic humor, sounds much like characterizations of O’Connor’s own “language of apocalypse” and “imagination of extremity.”³ Moreover, Bloy’s privileging of “suffering” as redemption apparently responded to O’Connor’s felt need for what Ralph Wood has called a “darker reading of human misery, a more startling revelation of transcendent hope.”⁴ Perhaps most important, Bloy’s symbolist vision of history—the<br>

  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

  Abstract: In company with other Southern writers, notably the Agrarians, who aspire to embrace a lost tradition and look on history as a repository of value, Flannery O’Connor seems a curious anomaly. She wrote of herself: “I am a Catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness, that Jung describes as unhistorical, solitary, and guilty.” Likewise her characters comprise a gallery of misfits isolated in a present and sentenced to a lifetime of exile from the human community. In O’Connor’s fiction, the past neither justifies nor even explains what is happening. If she believed, for example, in the importance of the past<br>

  Author(s) Estévez-Saá Margarita<br>
  Abstract: The history of Ireland and of the Irish is full of stories of deprival, to the extent that they were, for a long time, divested of houses, estates, land, country, and nation, and forced to emigrate. Irish literature, inevitably, has bore witness to this history of deprivation recreating it once and again in an attempt to overcome that trauma, by means of the transformation, reorientation, or re-evaluation of the experience of loss (Balaev, 2008: 164). Recent examples by representative writers of the Irish literary scene are, among others, Joseph O’Connor (

  Abstract: There is a history of Irish empathy for black people. It can be argued that a key component in the construction of Irish political and cultural identity is the practice of emotion of ‘feeling with’ and standing in the same place with black Others. From the end of the eighteenth century we can see the articulation of Irish national identity being formulated (at least partially if not centrally) in terms of an ability to share in and hence represent the political and cultural sufferings and triumphs of the racialised Other. The location and ethnic identity of these Others fluctuates over<br>

  Book Title: The humanities and the Irish university-Anomalies and opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Sullivan Michael<br>
  Abstract: This is the first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university. Ireland was a deeply religious country throughout the twentieth century but the colleges of its National University never established a religion or theology department. The official first language of Ireland is Irish but the vast majority of teaching in the arts and humanities is in English. These are two of the anomalies that long constrained humanities education in Ireland. This book charts a history of responses to humanities education in the Irish context. Reading the work of John Henry Newman, Padraig Pearse, Sean O Tuama, Denis Donoghue, Declan Kiberd, Richard Kearney and others, it looks for an Irish humanities ethos. It compares humanities models in the US, France and Asia with those in Ireland in light of work by Immanuel Kant, Pierre Bourdieu and Jacques Derrida. It should appeal to those interested in Irish education and history.The first book-length study of the humanities and the Irish university<br>

  Book Title: Sanctity as literature in late medieval Britain-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERNAU ANKE<br>
  Abstract: Explores how sanctity and questions of literariness are intertwined across a range of medieval genres.This collection explores some of the many ways in which sanctity was closely intertwined with the development of literary strategies across a range of writings in late medieval Britain. Rather than looking for clues in religious practices in order to explain such changes, or reading literature for information about sanctity, these essays consider the ways in which sanctity - as concept and as theme - allowed writers to articulate and to develop further their 'craft' in specific ways. While scholars in recent years have turned once more to questions of literary form and technique, the kinds of writings considered in this collection - writings that were immensely popular in their own time - have not attracted the same amount of attention as more secular forms. The collection as a whole offers new insights for scholars interested in form, style, poetics, literary history and aesthetics, by considering sanctity first and foremost as literature<br>

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Book Title: Sin and Evil-Moral Values in Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): PAULSON RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The confusion of sin and evil, or religious and moral transgression, is the subject of Ronald Paulson's latest book. He calls attention to the important distinction between sin and Evil (with a capital E) that in our times is largely ignored, and to the further confusion caused by the term "moral values." Ranging widely through the history of Western literature, Paulson focuses particularly on American and English works of the eighteenth through twentieth centuries to discover how questions of evil and sin-and evil and sinful behavior-have been discussed and represented.The breadth of Paulson's discussion is enormous, taking the reader from Greek and Roman tragedy, to Christian satire in the work of Swift and Hogarth, to Hawthorne's and Melville's novels, and finally to twentieth-century studies of good and evil by such authors as James, Conrad, Faulkner, Greene, Heller, Vonnegut, and O'Brien. Where does evil come from? What are "moral values"? If evil is a cultural construct, what does that imply? Paulson's literary tour of sin and evil over the past two hundred years provides not only a historical perspective but also new ways of thinking about important issues that characterize our own era of violence, intolerance, and war.<br>

  Abstract: In its global approach the book is part of the new shift toward "big history," in which traditional period divisions are challenged in favor of looking at the entire past of the world from start to end.

This book will inform the work of historians of all periods and at all levels, and contributes to the current reconsideration of traditional period divisions (such as Modernity and Postmodernity), which the author finds outmoded.<br>

  Abstract: To situate history in the long term entails having a view upon time. Its dynamic force provides the unfolding framework within which things both continue from the past and also change. Time’s three perspectival states of past, present, and potential future remain fixed in their successive sequencing. Yet the eras to which they apply are always being updated. As that happens, more history is generated daily for humans to consider.<br>

  Abstract: Shaping and reshaping history is a retrospective art, performed after the event. Communal and individual interpretations of the vast and complex past are, however, perennially open to debate – which has spawned the intriguing thought of sending not merely the mind travelling to other epochs but living people to do likewise. If such voyages were to become feasible, then the shape of history could be viewed from both far away and close at hand. And epoch jumpers could not only witness past events to provide a trans-time commentary but they might even, so it is speculated, be able to change things<br>

  CHAPTER 2  Deep Continuities from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Persistence or continuity in history is an underrated and often overlooked factor. It lacks the high drama of mutability, and it is at variance with the everyday awareness of diurnal changes – from day to night, and on to day again. In the phraseology of Henri Bergson, the fertile French philosopher—psychologist who probed the human sense of temporal flux: ‘Being is always Becoming’ and ‘Becoming is infinitely varied.’¹ Yet to be able to measure change, whether at macro-or micro-level, there must be some constant factors to act as benchmarks.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Micro-change from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9c3">Time and the Shape of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Restless ‘change’ accompanies and intrudes upon continuity, which it helps to define by offering a contrast. However, it is misleading to think solely in terms of a binary divide between two forces. While history is often said to contain a mixture of ‘continuity and change’, the formulation needs radical amendment to recognise significantly different sorts of ‘change’. Otherwise the breadth of just one concept of non-continuity is so great that it loses any real explanatory force.<br>

  Abstract: Thinking of history as travelling along a line, rather than round in a completed circle, is an alternative way of interpreting the experience of time. The seasons go round; but each spring is a new one, not an old spring revived. Life is viewed as a journey from youth to old age, which is halted only at the ‘journey’s end’ by death. ‘An individual is a four-dimensional object of greatly elongated form. In ordinary language, we say that he [or she] has considerable extension in time and insignificant extension in space,’ explained physicist Arthur Eddington kindly. Not all, of course,<br>

  Abstract: Drama, novelty, friction, irregularity, upheaval, radical discontinuity, abrupt metamorphosis, revolutionary transformations – these also occur, in nature as well as in human affairs. For that reason, the old twofold distinction between ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ is inadequate to ‘shape’ the whole of history. Instead, the different forms of transformation need to be assessed separately. ‘Change’, which sounds unitary, is in reality highly diversified, as the previous chapter has argued. There are many forms of transformation, from the micro-changes that form ‘evolution’ to the macro-changes that form ‘revolution’.<br>

  Abstract: Paramount among the cataclysmic surprises that history might spring is the possibility of the imminent end of the world. After all, stylistically, an abrupt, transformational finale to any story remains one of the leading alternatives to the slow, gradual fade-out.¹ So perhaps the world will conclude not with a whimper after all, but instead with a bang. Fears and hopes about cosmic endings lead some to intense experiences of ‘time anxiety’ – although for all who worry there are others who scoff at the prospect and others still who just decide to wait and see.<br>

  Abstract: This book is the first major account of political thought in twentieth-century Europe, both West and East, to appear since the end of the Cold War. Skillfully blending intellectual, political, and cultural history, Jan-Werner Müller elucidates the ideas that shaped the period of ideological extremes before 1945 and the liberalization of West European politics after the Second World War. He also offers vivid portraits of famous as well as unjustly forgotten political thinkers and the movements and institutions they inspired.Müller pays particular attention to ideas advanced to justify fascism and how they relate to the special kind of liberal democracy that was created in postwar Western Europe. He also explains the impact of the 1960s and neoliberalism, ending with a critical assessment of today's self-consciously post-ideological age.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np9jh">Contesting Democracy</a><br>
  Abstract: The historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin once observed: ‘I have lived through most of the twentieth century without, I must add, suffering personal hardship. I remember it only as the most terrible century in Western history.’¹ The century was also one in which political ideas seemed to play an exceptionally important role – so much so that contemporaries connected them directly to the catastrophes and cataclysms through which they were living. This belief in the vast influence of ideas did not depend on political allegiance: the Polish poet (and anti-Communist) Czesław Miłosz pointed out that during the mid-twentieth century ‘the<br>

  CHAPTER 4  Reconstruction Thought: from:

  Abstract: Post-war reconstruction in Europe presented formidable, in fact unprecedented, tasks. They were, above all, material. But the challenges were also moral and symbolic. While the Holocaust was to remain marginal to thinking about the war at least until the 1960s, the meaning of mass violence and atrocity was immediately debated by political thinkers across the continent. After all, from the late 1930s to the late 1940s more people had been ‘killed by their fellow human beings than ever before in the history of humankind’.¹<br>

  Book Title: The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): DUPRÉ LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: The Enlightenment's critique of tradition was a necessary consequence of the fundamental modern principle that we humans are solely responsible for the course of history. Hence we can accept no belief, no authority, no institutions that are not in some way justified. This foundation, for better or for worse, determined the course of the following centuries. Despite contemporary reactions against it, the Enlightenment continues to shape our own time and still distinguishes Western culture from any other.<br>

  7  The New Science of History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npfbd">The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: The writing of history has always been inspired by the belief that the knowledge of the past sheds light on the present. Yet the nature of this knowledge has varied from one period to another. Ancient writers, both classical and biblical, assumed that the essential patterns of life remained identical and therefore that history provided lasting models for instruction and imitation. Hence the search for historical prototypes of current customs and institutions. Legendary founders of cities, ancestors of existing professions, prehistorical legislators, and establishers of rituals were believed to grant them legitimacy. This belief in tradition persisted among Christians, even<br>

  Book Title: Simplexity-Simplifying Principles for a Complex World'<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weiss Giselle<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the history of living organisms may be summed up by their remarkable ability to find solutions that avoid the world's complexity by imposing on it their own rules and functions. Evolution has resolved the problem of complexity not by simplifying but by finding solutions whose processes-though they can sometimes be complex-allow us to act in the midst of complexity and of uncertainty. Nature can inspire us by making us realize that simplification is never simple and requires instead that we choose, refuse, connect, and imagine, in order to act in the best possible manner. Such solutions are already being applied in design and engineering and are significant in biology, medicine, economics, and the behavioral sciences.<br>

  Abstract: The word “theory” has a complicated etymological history that I won’t linger over except to point out what can make its meaning confusing. The way the word has actually been used at certain periods has made it mean something like what we call “practice,” whereas at other periods it has meant something very different from practice: a concept to which practice can appeal.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npkg4">Theory of Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: In the first lecture we discussed the reasons why literary theory in the twentieth century is shadowed by skepticism, but as we were talking about that we actually introduced another issue that isn’t quite the same as skepticism—namely,
                  determinism. In the course of intellectual history, we said, first you encounter concern about the distance between the perceiver and the perceived, a concern that gives rise to skepticism about whether we can know things as they really are. But then as an outgrowth of this concern in figures like Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, you get the further question, not just<br>

  Abstract: In this lecture we begin a series of approaches to twentieth-century “formalism.” That’s a big word, and has often been a pejorative one. At the end of our series of discussions, I hope it won’t seem quite as daunting and that its varied settings and implications will have been made clear to you. The topic we take up now belongs as much to the history of criticism as to literary theory. I’ve said there’s a difference between the history of criticism and theory of literature, one difference being that the history of criticism involves literary evaluation: the question of why<br>

                  aftera poem was composed may well be relevant to the overall structure of the poem and should not be avoided owing simply to a scruple about intention.” Thatshouldbe truly shocking to hear, not just for anyone with a scruple about intention, but for anyone simply wondering what counts as evidence.

I’ll return to what may have seemed at times the missing link, literature, in a minute. In the meantime, I just wanted to point out something I’m sure you’ve noticed even when I haven’t mentioned it: namely, that each of these approaches to identity has a history in two chapters. Each history arrives at a second chapter that is something like a deconstructive moment, signifying on theory itself, on the<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Early Christians-Selected Essays<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): SNYDER H. GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: A central figure in the reconception of early Christian history over the last three decades, Wayne A. Meeks offers here a selection of his most influential writings on the New Testament and early Christianity. His essays illustrate recent changes in our thinking about the early Christian movement and pose provocative questions regarding the history of this period.Meeks explores a fascinating range of topics, from the figure of the androgyne in antiquity to the timeless matter of God's reliability, from Paul's ethical rhetoric to New Testament pictures of Christianity's separation from Jewish communities. Meeks' introduction offers a retrospective on New Testament studies of the past thirty years and explains the intersection of these studies with a variety of exploratory and revisionist movements in the humanities, embracing social theory, history, anthropology, and literature. In an epilogue the author reflects on future directions for New Testament scholarship.<br>

  EQUAL TO GOD from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn08">In Search of the Early Christians</a><br>
  Abstract: John 5:18 says that the plot to have Jesus killed began because Jesus was “making himself equal to God.” This assertion can hardly be historical, so we must seek an explanation for it in the history of the Johannine circle. It was not only the Johannine Christians who made such connections, of course. Already in Mark hostility against Jesus is first aroused by his claim to exercise a prerogative—to forgive sins—that is God’s alone (Mark 2:7), and the actual plot against his life springs, as in John, from a Sabbath healing (3:6). Christians prior to John had appropriated<br>

  Abstract: In Helmut Koester’s enormous contribution to the history of early Christianity, one of the things of which he has never tired of reminding us is the exuberance of Jesus’ followers that created, in the first decades of the movement’s existence, the wildest diversity of mythic portraits of him.¹ Students of the New Testament had often been blinded to this diversity by confusing the church’s canon with the canon of the historian. However, we do not have to look beyond the canonical documents to see one of these developments that is among the most astonishing of all: the subject of this<br>

  BREAKING AWAY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1npn08">In Search of the Early Christians</a><br>
  Abstract: We have now become accustomed to say that earliest Christianity was a sect of Judaism. This is useful language: it helps us avoid some kinds of anachronism, and it may assist Christians to approach the painful history of Jewish-Christian relations with appropriate humility. Moreover, there is ancient support for this terminology. It was Josephus who depicted the “Jewish philosophy” as made up of three or four “sects” (αìρέσεις,
                  Ant.13.171;Vit.10–12;B.J.2.162; their members αìρετισταì,B.J.2.119, 124; cf.Ant.18.11, Φιλ0σ0Φíαι, “philosophies”). And the book of Acts, which like Josephus speaks of Pharisees and Sadducees as<br>

  Abstract: The essays collected here illustrate some of the tasks that my generation of New Testament scholars have found before us: the retrieval of the ordinary out of the silence imposed by centuries, exploring the dialectic between surviving fragments of ancient language and the other social forms in which they were once embedded, discovering the ways by which emerging communities invented moral practice and moral intuition, understanding the multifaceted Jewishness of the early Christian movement.

  Abstract: Recent progress in neuroscience and its integration in dynamic evolutionary processes, which include culture and its history, prompt us to rethink certain central philosophical questions, such as the significance of death. Death is an essential biological phenomenon directly related to the evolution of species. It has taken on a special dimension in the history of humanity. Buff on rightly said that “death is as natural as life.” Many philosophical and religious fundamentals, which emphasize the sacred character of life, maintain the balance by doing the same for its interruption by death.

  Abstract: THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION is inescapably ritualistic (one is received into the church by a solemn washing with water), uncompromisingly moral (“be ye perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect,” said Jesus), and unapologetically intellectual (be ready to give a “reason for the hope that is in you,” in the words of I Peter). Like all the major religions of the world, Christianity is more than a set of devotional practices and a moral code: it is also a way of thinking about God, about human beings, about the world and history.

As a young priest he had studied the epistles of Saint Paul, and as a bishop he preached a series of sermons on the Gospel of John, on the first epistle of John and on the Psalms.

  Book Title: Frontiers of History-Historical Inquiry in the Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: This book, the third volume of Donald Kelley's monumental survey of Western historiography, covers the twentieth century, especially Europe. As in the first two volumes, the author discusses historical methods and ideas of all sorts to provide a detailed map of historical learning. Here he carries the survey forward to our own times, confronting directly the challenges of postmodernism and historical narrative. Kelley offers highly original discussions of historians of the last half century (including friends and mentors), the "linguistic turn," the "end of history," the philosophy of history, and various new methods of histories.The book focuses first on the state of the art of history in France, Germany, Britain, and the United States on the eve of World War I. Kelley then traces every important historiographical issue and development historians have encountered in the twentieth century. With the completion of this trilogy, Kelley presents the only comprehensive modern survey of historical writing. He provides an unparalleled portrait of the rich variety of historical method along with an insider's view of the challenges of capturing history on the written page.<br>

  Abstract: The first volume of this narrative began with the conceit of these two faces, those of Herodotus and Thucydides—cultural history and political history, anachronistically speaking—and added a third, a Livian (or Eusebian) national (or confessional) and by imperial extension universal history from a European and ethnocentric center; and these forebears still haunt historiographical practice. What Momigliano suggests is that Herodotus, in a world still being explored and charted, would have continued going about satisfying his curiosity and seeking local meanings, while Thucydides would have thrown up his hands at the unanalyzable chaos which his posterity has brought.

  Abstract: Historians have always, though not always ostensibly, sought a “usable past”; and reviewing historiographical practice around the world and back over two and a half millennia, one cannot be surprised that ideas of objectivity, a single “big story,” and other “noble dreams” have given way to even older notions of history as the product of social creation or authorial imagination. “Representation” has become a watchword of contemporary historical writing; and the upshot, Foucauldian warnings about the tyranny of the subject notwithstanding, is to restore the “point of view” as sovereign, whether or not the historical viewer is in full command<br>

  Abstract: The notion of the film medium has played a central role in the intellectual history of cinema. It has been a major focus of film theory from early in the twentieth century through the writings of Christian Metz. In a great number of cases, the idea has performed a legitimizing function. The case for film as art was made by arguing that film is a distinctive medium, one with its own range of properties and effects such that it warrants a place of its own in the system of the arts. Film, in other words, was not merely theater in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1nps8x">Engaging the Moving Image</a><br>
  Abstract: Almost since the inception of moving pictures, those pictures have often featured dance. The obvious reason for this is that the natural subject of moving pictures is movement. And dances—along with hurtling locomotives, car chases, cattle stampedes, tennis matches, intergalactic dog-fights, and the like—move. Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement. Many moving-picture makers have devoted admirable amounts of effort and imagination to portraying dance in or through media as diverse as film, video, and computer animation.

  Abstract: Sin, I wish to argue, has a history. As we saw in the previous chapter, the Old Testament contains a number of metaphors for sin, the most pre - dominant being that of sin as a burden. This concept changed dramatically, however, during the Second Temple period, an era in which some of the youngest books of the Old Testament were written, as well as a number of nonbiblical books. During this time the metaphor of sin as a burden was replaced by that of sin as a debt.¹ Although there is little evidence in the Hebrew texts of the<br>

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

The eclecticism of the group stems from the eclectic texture of Freud’s writing: while always maintaining a base in medical science and therapeutic technique, Freud’s work comes to include an array of essays in interpretation and several monumental theories of history and culture.

But at the same time, if we employ psychoanalysis in its most pristine state, its most traditional form, we run the risk of eliminating history in the name of studying it.” The eclectic essays in this part all point to both the “worth” and the “risk” of a psychoanalytically inflected historiography. Such an enterprise can move toward one of two extremes. On one hand, “psychohistory” has sometimes devolved into the simplified analysis of historically<br>

  Abstract: In this essay I wish to discuss my work not as applied psychoanalysis—that term still has some of the aura of early psychoanalytic imperialism, Freud’s talk about “conquering” various spheres of thought—but rather in connection with psychoanalysis as its source. My work in psychohistorical areas begins with psychoanalytic influence, and never loses that influence, but it does evolve in its own way in certain additional directions. There is a real paradox here, important to keep in mind particularly in historical and cultural studies: without psychoanalysis, we don’t have a psychology worthy of address to history and society or<br>

  Abstract: It is by now a truism that “wisdom thinks resolutely within the framework of a theology of creation.”¹ That now common assumption among interpreters, however, has not always been obvious. It is, rather, a hard-won consensus that emerged in a season of scholarship preoccupied with “history,” in which theological interpretation of the Old Testament was dominated by the programmatic slogan “God acts in history.” The connection between wisdom and creation has permitted interpretation to move outside “history” and to challenge the fear of “natural theology” that pertained in Barthian circles of interpretation. Once that consensus judgment was reached about creation<br>

  Abstract: The book of Jeremiah offers a clear test case and model for the shift in scholarly paradigms in Old Testament study. In the “history of traditions” perspective dominated by Gerhard von Rad, the tradition of Jeremiah is firmly situated in the exodus and Sinai-covenant traditions of Moses, but with some engagement with the Davidic-messianic traditions as well.¹ This entire phase of scholarship has resulted in a lopsided emphasis upon the traditio-historical background of the book.<br>

I have chosen to begin my own story about Wingren in a way that focuses on his ideas, contextualized though they may be, and at the same time in a way that from the very beginning emphasizes Wingren’s obvious affinity with the academic context and public.<br>

When we remind ourselves about something from the past, it means, necessarily, that we must exclude so much more. To tell a story means inevitably to remove the largest part. Each memory that we retrieve requires simultaneously a great deal of forgetting. Therefore, there is always already another story waiting to be told before each story begins.

  7  Systematic Theology Turned Critique of Civilization from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1p5f1x6">Becoming Human Again</a><br>
  Abstract: The same process of modernization and industrialization that successfully transformed the entire world by materializing the project of the Enlightenment has always co-existed with a tradition of critique of civilization that aims to disclose a darker reality beneath the surface of this success story. One does not need to use words such as
                  Wideraufklärung, expressions of a sort of anti-Enlightenment, in order to recognize that every civilization in history tends to be blind to its own barbarism; it is sufficient to state that the Enlightenment has always been imbued with a sort of Romanticism.

  Abstract: Strange as it may seem, beauty still needs to be defended. In the history of the West, beauty has played the role of Cinderella to her sisters, goodness and truth. I don’t mean to say that beauty in art or nature hasn’t been appreciated throughout history—though there have been times when beauty has been the subject of frontal assaults—but simply that when we start getting official, when we get theological or philosophical, beauty becomes a hot potato.<br>

  Abstract: History is written by the victors, so the saying goes. It would be pleasant to believe that the history of literature (or the arts in general) might prove an exception to this rule, that artistic merit will always be recognized in its own time, regardless of fashion or ideology. But we know that’s not true. Artists who consciously or unconsciously spurn the dominant institutions and trends of their culture always struggle to gain recognition.<br>

  Abstract: Having in the last chapter treated “information” in its technical sense, this chapter will treat the more colloquial use of the word by examining a mega-novel subgenre drawing on a different type of reference work, the encyclopedic novel. That term has been frequently used over the past six decades to refer to mega-novels that incorporate substantial specialized information from the sciences, the arts, and history.¹ Most famously Edward Mendelson defined encyclopedic narratives as those that “attempt to render the full range of knowledge and beliefs of a national culture,” echoing Northrop Frye’s earlier claim that encyclopedic fiction presents “a total<br>

  Book Title: The Art of Visual Exegesis-Rhetoric, Texts, Images<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Jeal Roy R.<br>
  Abstract: With a special focus on biblical texts and images, this book nurtures new developments in biblical studies and art history during the last two or three decades. Analysis and interpretation of specific works of art introduce guidelines for students and teachers who are interested in the relation of verbal presentation to visual production. The essays provide models for research in the humanities that move beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries erected in previous centuries. In particular, the volume merges recent developments in rhetorical interpretation and cognitive studies with art historical visual exegesis. Readers will master the tools necessary for integrating multiple approaches both to biblical and artistic interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Art history is a discipline of images, but more than that it is a discipline that relies on the flexibility of the term
                  image. Images are the vital essence at the center of art history, the essential constituent that distinguishes the field from aesthetics. Most art historians study pictures or sculptures, concrete instances of cultural production, items that index the agency of some person, group, or force that created—or even simply chose to frame or set apart—some object. yet over the last hundred years or so, art history has developed into an increasingly promiscuous field of inquiry that<br>

  Author(s) Clifton James<br>
  Abstract: In a lecture of January 7, 1668, to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, Philippe de Champaigne famously criticized Nicolas Poussin for his failure to adhere faithfully to sacred history in his painting of

  Book Title: Bearing Witness-Perspectives on War and Peace from the Arts and Humanities<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Johnstone Tiffany<br>
  Abstract: As the centenary of the Great War approaches, citizens worldwide are reflecting on the history, trauma, and losses of a war-torn twentieth century. It is in remembering past wars that we are at once confronted with the profound horror and suffering of armed conflict and the increasing elusiveness of peace. The contributors to Bearing Witness do not presume to resolve these troubling questions, but provoke new kinds of reflection. They explore literature, the arts, history, language, and popular culture to move beyond the language of rhetoric and commemoration provided by politicians and the military. Adding nuance to discussions of war and peace, this collection probes the understanding and insight created in the works of musicians, dramatists, poets, painters, photographers, and novelists, to provide a complex view of the ways in which war is waged, witnessed, and remembered. A compelling and informative collection, Bearing Witness sheds new light on the impact of war and the power of suffering, heroism and memory, to expose the human roots of violence and compassion. Contributors include Heribert Adam (Simon Fraser University), Laura Brandon (Carleton University), Mireille Calle-Gruber (Université La Sorbonne Nouvelle), Janet Danielson (Simon Fraser University), Sandra Djwa (emeritus, Simon Fraser University), Alan Filewod (University of Guelph), Sherrill Grace (University of British Columbia), Patrick Imbert (University of Ottawa), Tiffany Johnstone (PhD Candidate, University of British Columbia), Martin Löschnigg (Graz University), Lauren Lydic (PhD, University of Toronto), Conny Steenman Marcusse (Netherlands), Jonathan Vance (University of Western Ontario), Aritha van Herk (University of Calgary), Peter C. van Wyck (Concordia University), Christl Verduyn (Mount Allison University), and Anne Wheeler (filmmaker).<br>

  Author(s) ROSS CHRISTINE<br>
  Abstract: Since its emergence in the field of art history in the 1980s, visuality – a notion that refers to the visible condition of art, to the fact that art is, partially at least, a matter of vision (in its production, exhibition, circulation, and reception) – has been key to the decentring of both the artist and the viewing subject in its relation to the image. Vision came to be systematically understood as an act conditioned by culture, social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and geography. The fruitfulness of poststructuralist art historical research in this area of study is clearly noticeable in its manifold<br>

  Abstract: In an essay (translated here for the first time in English) that has been pivotal to the understanding of the history of electronic arts, Raymond Bellour shows how video art’s specific contribution to the realm of moving images lies in its unique deployment of the self-portrait. With video, argues Bellour, the image becomes a site of representation and interpellation of the self – but a self whose identity is more a question or an open-ended project than a definition or a clear determination. The relevance of this text to precarious visuality is indisputable: it discloses a visual writing of the “I”<br>

  Abstract: What role do painted or sculpted images play in human reproduction? Put this way, the question seems to be concerned more with the history of embryology and reproduction than with the history of art. Yet such an interrogation appears central to Western art and its history if we take into consideration the extent to which theories of art, from the Hellenistic period up to the nineteenth century, have accorded importance to the notion of an “ideal of beauty” capable of guiding the human species to its total perfection – towards its “physical and moral perfection,” as the men of the eighteenth<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the history of molecular biology and its central notion of “genetic code” from a semiotic perspective. By contrasting different semiotic perspectives, I contemplate a variety of constituent pseudo-evidences in current discourse on the destiny of the human race, at the dawn of wide scale technical and cultural transformations made possible by the manifest possibility of human cloning in the relative short term. From these pseudo-evidences, the tropes “genetic code” and its “decrypting” appear fundamental to me.<br>

  Abstract: During the 1960s the structuralists had declared Sartre, as well as the paradigm of existential phenomenology he represented, obsolete, or “passé.” However, May 1968 signified a resounding vindication of Sartre’s doctrine of human freedom, for May demonstrated that “events” happened, that history was more than the opaque, frozen landscape the structuralists had made it out to be. Thereafter, Sartre’s concerted involvement with the Maoists—at one point, he served as the titular editor of no fewer than three Maoist publications (

  Abstract: The striking thing about September 11, 2001, and the War on Terror that followed is the way in which a spectacular event was momentarily rendered invisible, placed beyond the seeable either by reason of its traumatic visibility or by responses to the political history of images inherited from previous conflicts—especially the Vietnam War.

Yet the conversation for constructive theology doesn’t end within the sphere of theology. Starting with its emphasis on philosophy, social sciences, and culture, constructive theology has been in conversation with other academic disciplines throughout its history. That is to say constructive theology is inherently interdisciplinary. In its effort to be an actionable, relevant form of theology, it has always, from the proto-constructive theologies of Ten Broeke and Meland, through the Workgroup’s textbooks and today, maintained the importance of incorporating insights from other disciplines into<br>

  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Struck Peter T.<br>
  Abstract: Divination and Human Naturecasts a new perspective on the rich tradition of ancient divination-the reading of divine signs in oracles, omens, and dreams. Popular attitudes during classical antiquity saw these readings as signs from the gods while modern scholars have treated such beliefs as primitive superstitions. In this book, Peter Struck reveals instead that such phenomena provoked an entirely different accounting from the ancient philosophers. These philosophers produced subtle studies into what was an odd but observable fact-that humans could sometimes have uncanny insights-and their work signifies an early chapter in the cognitive history of intuition.<br>

Although her life cannot be verified by any historical source, we are sure she existed, if only because Mary, the mother of Jesus, had to have had a mother herself. Her Hebrew name, Hannah, is probably derived from identification with the prophetess Hannah, and the foundation for the rest of her rich and complex history is found in the

  Author(s) URQUHART JANE<br>
  Abstract: If looking at
                  Midnight’s Childrenas historiographic metafiction brings into focus the complex relationship between history, textuality, and authorial location, looking atMidnight’s Childrenas magic realism produces a quasi-religious comic novel in which the nature of language itself is problematized in the service of readerly responsibility. The presence of nonrational, magical elements in an otherwise apparently realistic, rational world serves as a rejection of the overwhelmingly scientific, rational approach to life which has been characterized as the dominant Western post-Enlightenment view (Harrison,Rushdie55).

  Abstract: Medicine has not been a unique or homogeneous task throughout history. What we call medicine is a diverse set of ideas, methods, procedures, and practices that has been changing continuously from the beginning of human culture until now. The only point in common throughout history has been the goal of helping people overcome disease and promote health. But if we try to analyze the contents proper of those two terms, “health” and “disease,” we realize that over time their meaning has changed; a canonical or paradigmatic concept cannot be found for them.

  Abstract: Defining medicine as a discipline and as a profession, requires a recognition that it comprises theory, and not merely practice.¹ The conceptualization of suffering and disease in secular terms, for example, has been one of the most pervasive theoretical aims of medicine throughout history. In addition, as a proto-paradigmatic discipline, medicine has been influenced by the science of the positivistic era, which may be said to have the inherent goal of reproducing itself and achieving autonomy as a techno-scientific enterprise. Therefore, as a scientific discipline, modern medicine shares with the sciences the goals of innovation and invention, aside from its<br>

  Abstract: Physician education is an interweaving of the three common themes of all professional education: theory, practice, and history.¹ In medicine, the role of history has been the least understood of this triad. For musicians, history is the story of the music that helps in the understanding of theory and the interpretation that guides performance. For a lawyer, history primarily means precedents: prior rulings upon which a new case can be constructed. Neither law nor music, however, shares with medicine the constant pressure of a rapidly developing scientific knowledge base that requires doctors to maintain an awareness of the most current<br>

Through research in art history, religious studies, philosophy, medical anthropology, and feminism, I first show how members of an international movement devoted to birth and art are actively using religious, secular, and re-sacralized art imagery in the visualization of labour and birth and as a ritualistic part of birth as a rite of passage.

  Abstract: Mothers and the experience of motherhood have been historically overwritten by patriarchal practices that accord some lives and certain life stories greater value. Fiction and non-fiction stories by and about mothers—particularly the stories of poor women, working women, and women of colour—have gone largely unrecorded. What remains are patriarchal daughter-centred stories of young women who move from one male protector to another: father to husband to son.

  SIX  RED LEGACIES IN FICTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1sq5t95">Red Legacies in China</a><br>
  Author(s) Wang David Der-wei<br>
  Abstract: Amid a mixture of euphoria and controversy, the Chinese writer Mo Yan 莫言 (1955–) was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. Readers and critics in Chinese and Sinophone communities welcomed the news because since the mid-1980s, Mo Yan has proven to be a most eloquent and poignant storyteller of modern Chinese history, a writer, in the words of the Nobel Prize Committee, “who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary.”¹ The Chinese government took Mo Yan’s honor most favorably, treating it as a belated recognition of Chinese socialist literature at its finest.

  Author(s) Barmé Geremie R.<br>
  Abstract: This chapter discusses a few areas in which I believe we can find traces of the abiding, and beguiling, heritage of the Maoist era and state socialism in today’s China.¹ In a number of interconnected spheres, a nuanced understanding of what have been called “red legacies” in China, as well as more broadly, can continue to enliven discussions of contemporary history, thought, culture, and politics. In the following I will focus on recent events before offering, in turn, some observations on history, the Maoist legacy, and academic engagement with the People’s Republic.<br>

  Abstract: Although slightly older than the commonly-supposed professionalising Arnoldian origin, the discipline of English studies is relatively young, having come into being as “English language and literature” in 1828 at the University of London (now UCL rather than the federated research university that currently takes the name University of London).¹ Over the course of the discipline’s short history, however, a range of aspects has remained ever-present and unsatisfactorily resolved under the heading of ‘value’. As John Hartley traces it, these debates can be subdivided into three phases (simplifying for reasons of comprehensibility). The first is to chart the lineage of Matthew<br>

  Book Title: Love and its Critics-From the Song of Songs to Shakespeare and Milton’s Eden<br>
  Publisher: Open Book Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Movsesian Arpi<br>
  Abstract: This book is a history of love and the challenge love offers to the laws and customs of its times and places, as told through poetry from the Song of Songs to John Milton’s Paradise Lost. It is also an account of the critical reception afforded to such literature, and the ways in which criticism has attempted to stifle this challenge. Bryson and Movsesian argue that the poetry they explore celebrates and reinvents the love the troubadour poets of the eleventh and twelfth centuries called fin’amor: love as an end in itself, mutual and freely chosen even in the face of social, religious, or political retribution. Neither eros nor agape, neither exclusively of the body, nor solely of the spirit, this love is a middle path. Alongside this tradition has grown a critical movement that employs a 'hermeneutics of suspicion', in Paul Ricoeur’s phrase, to claim that passionate love poetry is not what it seems, and should be properly understood as worship of God, subordination to Empire, or an entanglement with the structures of language itself – in short, the very things it resists. The book engages with some of the seminal literature of the Western canon, including the Bible, the poetry of Ovid, and works by English authors such as William Shakespeare and John Donne, and with criticism that stretches from the earliest readings of the Song of Songs to contemporary academic literature. Lively and enjoyable in its style, it attempts to restore a sense of pleasure to the reading of poetry, and to puncture critical insistence that literature must be outwitted. It will be of value to professional, graduate, and advanced undergraduate scholars of literature, and to the educated general reader interested in treatments of love in poetry throughout history.<br>

They range far and wide throughout history, from Plato and the Neoplatonists, to the Rabbinic and Christian interpreters of the Song of Songs, from the clerics behind the savage Albigensian Crusade, to the seventeenth-century English Puritan author William Prynne, who never met a joy he failed to condemn. Love has never lacked for those who try to tame it for “higher” purposes, or those who would argue that “the worst evils have been committed in the name of love”.¹ At the same time, love has always had its passionate defenders, though these have more<br>

  Book Title: Zhou Zuoren and an Alternative Chinese Response to Modernity-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Daruvala Susan<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the issues of nation and modernity in China by focusing on the work of Zhou Zuoren (1885-1967), one of the most controversial of modern Chinese intellectuals and brother of the writer Lu Xun. Zhou was radically at odds with many of his contemporaries and opposed their nation-building and modernization projects. Through his literary and aesthetic practice as an essayist, Zhou espoused a way of constructing the individual and affirming the individual’s importance in opposition to the normative national subject of most May Fourth reformers. Zhou’s work presents an alternative vision of the nation and questions the monolithic claims of modernity by promoting traditional aesthetic categories, the locality rather than the nation, and a literary history that values openness and individualism.<br>

  Book Title: The Qing Formation in World-Historical Time-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Struve Lynn A.<br>
  Abstract: For many years, the Ming and Qing dynasties have been grouped as “late imperial China," a temporal framework that allows scholars to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of Ming rule that imparted a particular character to state and society throughout the Qing and into the twentieth century. This paradigm asserts the autonomous character of social change in China and has allowed historians to create a “China-centered history." Recently, however, many scholars have begun emphasizing the singular qualities of the Qing. Among the eight contributors to this volume on the formation of the Qing, those who emphasize the Manchu ethos of the Qing tend to see it as part of an early modernity and stress parallel and sometimes mutually reinforcing patterns of political consolidation and cultural integration across Eurasia. Other contributors who examine the Qing formation from the perspective of those who lived through the dynastic transition see the advent of Qing rule as prompting attempts by the Chinese subjects of the new empire to make sense of what they perceived as a historical disjuncture and to rework these understandings into an accommodation to foreign rule. In contrast to the late imperial paradigm, the new ways of configuring the Qing in historical time in both groups of essays assert the singular qualities of the Qing formation.<br>

  Author(s) von Glahn Richard<br>
  Abstract: For three decades, historians of China have situated the Qing dynasty within a “late-imperial” epoch of Chinese history stretching from the midsixteenth to the early twentieth century. The late-imperial paradigm was conceived in reaction to the long-dominant characterization of China before the Opium War as caught in a repetitive “dynastic cycle” that reproduced an essentially inert “traditional” society until China was fully exposed to the forces of modernization issuing from the Western world. The late-imperial framework instead sought to identify and evaluate indigenous patterns of social, economic, and cultural change initiated in the last century of the Ming dynasty that<br>

  Author(s) Perdue Peter C.<br>
  Abstract: How can we place the first century of the Qing dynasty in worldhistorical time? Earlier generations of historians could not even conceive of this question. For Hegel and Marx, China until the nineteenth century was the land of eternal stagnation, embalmed in an airless coffin, never an active participant in the formation of the only progressive civilization, that of the West. Later historians, supporting nationalist and modernization movements, altered the vision slightly to include “change within tradition,” but they still cut off nearly all of imperial China’s history from the modern world. Today, no one can ignore the spectacular rise<br>

  Author(s) Millward James A.<br>
  Abstract: This volume, and the conference that produced it, have come at an apt historiographical moment. New data and new interpretations have led in recent years to something of a paradigm shift in how the Qing is viewed by historians of China (Rawski 1996). At the same time, the developing field of world history has been seeking new approaches to the last few centuries of accelerated global communication and integration, approaches that avoid “the West and the rest” dichotomies. Working China into such approaches has not been simple: while comparativists labor to relate China to frameworks based on European historical experience,¹<br>

  Abstract: In the study of world and comparative history for early-modern times, we have come to a new appreciation of the importance of different shapes of state-building. The European pattern of territoriality, citizenship, and multiple centers of competitive, mobilizing state-building activity, sometimes called “mercantilist,” is seen as building on continuities in political culture reaching back to the ancient Mediterranean. In the “gunpowder empires” of the Islamic world, which figure along with the Ming and Qing as the great early-modern “agrarian empires,” growth of trade and population can be seen openir.. g the way to inchoate regional state-building efforts that challenged the<br>

  Abstract: Words are just words, but they bedevil our efforts to write a meaningful history of the world when they limit our discourse and therefore our understanding of patterns and trends. I would like to suggest that we are missing a word for the opposite of “crisis.” The trends that we commonly encounter in comparative and global histories are growth, stagnation, stability, and crisis. Yet this vocabulary is stunted, and it is biased in ways that have made it difficult to recognize the dynamics of premodern societies.<br>

  Abstract: Not long ago it was common in Western scholarship to portray Qing China as one of the modern West’s several contrasting Others, on the assumption that the Chinese were imprisoned in their own past, from which they would be rescued by the forces of modernization or Westernization. After World War II, this version of the Qing “story” was updated within the framework of a concept of “later Chinese history,” which evolved into the more specific “late-imperial China.” This revision gave the Qing period a new and more sympathetic image as the historical moment when Chinese society and culture contended with<br>

  Abstract: This chapter deals with a specific type of ghost story, “the historical ghost tale.” By historical ghost tale, I mean a ghost story about a traumatic historical event rather than a problem of individual mortality. The event is usually of a political nature, especially dynastic fall and conquest. I am inspired here by Paul Ricoeur’s concept of “historical time,” which mediates between the lived time of the individual and the cosmic time of the universe.¹ Although the ghost story about history is most effective when it centers on one or more individualized ghost characters as “sufferers” or victims of history,²<br>

Moreover, the motifs of ghosts and monsters, gods and omens, can be durable, recurring with relatively little change across the course of history. On the other hand, one of the oldest justifications for recording anomalous events was to read them as omens of historical change: like their predecessors, the<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

  Book Title: A Patterned Past-Form and Thought in Early Chinese Historiography<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Schaberg David<br>
  Abstract: In this comprehensive study of the rhetoric, narrative patterns, and intellectual content of the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, David Schaberg reads these two collections of historical anecdotes as traces of a historiographical practice that flourished around the fourth century BCE among the followers of Confucius. He contends that the coherent view of early China found in these texts is an effect of their origins and the habits of reading they impose. Rather than being totally accurate accounts, they represent the efforts of a group of officials and ministers to argue for a moralizing interpretation of the events of early Chinese history and for their own value as skilled interpreters of events and advisers to the rulers of the day.<br>

  Abstract: The doctrine of divine simplicity has a long history involving complex accounts that interweave philosophy, scripture, and theology. Without a doubt, there is no single doctrine of divine simplicity that remained perfectly unaltered throughout the Christian tradition. Perhaps this is because, as Christopher Stead argues, throughout the early church various senses of divine simplicity were used to speak about God without ever clarifying which sense was in use. In other words, “we must not think that simplicity is itself a simple notion.”¹ However, the simplistic versions of divine simplicity represented in much contemporary theology—primarily from critics—might lead others<br>

As with other synoptic material, Bultmann argued, the discourses in Mark are composites of various traditions that came to the evangelist only after a complex history of development. Though the core of some of these traditions may go back to the historical Jesus, their final forms are the results of years of hard use by the church that completely reshaped them into the voice of the church.

  Abstract: Religia jako fenomen o zasięgu uniwersalnym w sensie historycznym i geograficznym zawsze budziła zainteresowanie człowieka i była początkowo przedmiotem przednaukowej refl eksji. Ponieważ zawsze stanowiła oczywisty fakt, w zasadzie nie stawiano pytań teoretycznych, dotyczących istoty i genezy religii czy też funkcji, jakie pełni; religia była i jest faktem naocznym, związanym w sposób istotny z życiem ludzkim i stanowiącym jego podstawowy wymiar.<br>

  Author(s) SOCHOÑ KS. JAN<br>
  Abstract: Podejmując się nauczania filozofii religii, wychodzę od zarysowania trudności, jakie wiążą się z faktem istnienia religii. Wyznacza ona bowiem zawiły krąg zagadnień natury historycznej, metodologicznej, światopoglądowej i zgoła metafizycznej. Nie ma przecież takiego oglądu religii, który byłby całkowicie autonomiczny, pozbawiony związków z określonym i już ukształtowanym rozpoznaniem dotyczącym świata oraz człowieka. Wypada przyjąć, że każde rozumienie czegokolwiek poprzedzone bywa przez swoiste przedrozumienie, co oznacza, że zanim przystąpimy do filozoficznej refleksji nad religią (religiami?), dysponujemy już własnym rozumieniem świata i poglądami na to, co przychodzi nam interpretować. Po prostu metoda przyjęta w badaniach musi, chcąc nie chcąc, w pewien sposób determinować<br>

  Abstract: „Habent sua fata libelli...” I książki mają swoje losy. Również książki filozoficzne mają swe własne losy, swe przeznaczenie. Z jednej strony chcą uchwycić prawdę, która jest ponadczasowa, wiecznie ważna, niezmienna i jako taka wymyka się nieustannej zmienności czasu, zmienności historycznych uwarunkowań i kulturowych mód. Z drugiej jednak strony dzieła fi lozofi czne są zawsze zakorzenione w jakiejś chwili, w jakimś momencie, w jakiejś historycznej sytuacji, w jakiejś kulturowej i narodowej swoistości, a nawet w osobistym życiorysie autora.

  Abstract: Arthur Nole, Tahltan Indigenous elder and storyteller, died on January 3, 2015, after breaking his leg while chopping wood. He lived a life indicative of the complexities of Indigenous lives and, particularly, the meshing of traditional activities and wage work. He was a dedicated moose hunter and passionate hunting guide, and he was tremendously interested in the telling and recording of Tahltan history. His later life was dominated by family activities and motivated by teaching young people the traditional skills of camping, hunting, and life on the land.<br>

  Abstract: The question of god’s Creation and its purpose is a perennial one that has both stumped exegetes of the Qurʾān and caused theologians to be embroiled in intense debates over the centuries. In offering a reflection on this topic, it is important to connect scriptural reflections on specific verses in the Qurʾān to their theological implications throughout Islamic intellectual history. To this extent, personal reflections on verses of the Qurʾān will be tethered to the more technical theological inquiries they contributed to. More specifically, these inquiries are (1) What does the mere presence of creation reveal about God’s nature? (2)<br>

  Book Title: The Film Museum Practice and Film Historiography-The Case of the Nederlands Filmmuseum (1946-2000)<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAMERIS BREGT<br>
  Abstract: Rich in detail, this is a study of the interrelationships between film historical discourse and archival practices. Exploring the history of several important collections from the EYE Film Museum in Amsterdam, Bregt Lameris shows how archival films and collections always carry the historical traces of selection policies, restoration philosophies, and exhibition strategies. The result is a compelling argument that film archives can never be viewed simply as innocent or neutral sources of film history.<br>

  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur explains in
                  Memory, History, Forgettingthat the interpretation of history does not begin with the historian but with the archivist. The decisions made by archivists on what should and should not be included in a collection are the first step in the process of interpreting historical facts; all the succeeding choices the historian makes depend on the composition and structure of the archive. As a consequence, the archive is not only the ‘starting point’ of historical research, it is also part of the historiographical discourse.¹ Furthermore, the act of collecting documents and objects always implies a change in<br>

  CHAPTER 6  Reconstructions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xssp">The Film Museum Practice and Film Historiography</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘ The current discourse of film restorers is a model for history making because it makes transparent the ways that a history is spliced together’ (Jones, 2012: 138). This comment clearly summarises the focus of this chapter: the reconstruction of films and the consolidation of a film museum editing structure, literally ‘ splicing’ the fragments of film history together. As with the activities of acquisition and collection, reconstruction is a matter of selection: the curator chooses which film clips will end up in the final restoration print. As a result, the reconstruction is generally aimed at ‘ completing’ a film,<br>

  CHAPTER 9  Performances from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xssp">The Film Museum Practice and Film Historiography</a><br>
  Abstract: Each film museum is embedded in a history of performances. Sometimes they attempt to deny this history, showing their films in screening rooms stripped of any historical reference. In other cases, however, they choose to show films in a ‘historically accurate’ way, which often results in hybrid forms of display, a mixture of historical reconstruction and modern experimentation. What seems central to the choice of display at the Filmmuseum is the way it defined its films – as individual works of art, to be displayed and viewed in isolation, or as examples of the way films were presented in the past<br>

  History and Genre from:

  Abstract: I call this paper “History and Genre” though history is a genre and genre has a history. It is this interweaving between history and genre that I seek to describe. In
                  The Political UnconsciousFredric Jameson wrote that genre criticism has been “thoroughly discredited by modern literary theory and practice.”¹ There are at least three reasons for this. First, the very notion that texts compose classes has been questioned. Secondly, the assumption that members of a genre share a common trait or traits has been questioned, and thirdly, the function of a genre as an interpretative guide has been questioned.<br>

  Abstract: Genres exist in nonverbal activities no less than in verbal. There are history paintings, portrait paintings, abstract paintings, as there are kinds of architecture and music genres. But if we wish to describe or explain or interpret these genres we use language—descriptive explanations and interpretation are themselves genres. I make this acknowledgment in order to indicate the range of this paper: I limit myself to our statements about speech and written genres.

  Innovation and Variation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xtv6">Genre Theory and Historical Change</a><br>
  Abstract: The study of literary history inevitably involves the study of literary change, and any explanation of change must distinguish among the types of change that are possible. These include changes within the work of a single writer, changes among different writers who share common ends, like the Scriblerus group (this can include, as well, changes in what are called “schools,” “movements,” and “periods”), changes in the forms of genres, changes in style, changes in critical interpretation. It is apparent that the term “change” identified with these many different literary situations—and they are not all that one can name—needs<br>

  Some Thoughts on the Problems of Literary Change 1750–1800 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xtv6">Genre Theory and Historical Change</a><br>
  Abstract: Literary change is intertwined with problems of individual change and social change. Human beings undergo physiological as well as cultural changes just as societies undergo institutional, political, religious, and technological changes. Although in our time concern with all types of change has become common because of the increased rapidity of social and technological changes, the desire, even need, to understand change in the Western world has a long philosophical history, as can be seen from the remarks of Heraclitus and Parmenides.<br>

  Abstract: The ambition of this study has been to explore the diversity of ways in which the popular has been conceptualised and materialised in France. Whereas domestic and external accounts of French culture have spontaneously identified it with élite culture, we have argued that any rigorous analysis of it must integrate and engage with majority cultural practices. The relationship between state, national institutions and cultural production takes very particular forms in France, closely enmeshed as this relationship has been with a specific political history, and with the exceptionally strong presence of linguistic and literary tradition as a prized element of national<br>

  Book Title: Undoing Art-  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Delville Michel<br>
  Abstract: What do Stéphane Mallarmé, Antonin Artaud, Meret Oppenheim, Asger Jorn, Yoko Ono, Tom Phillips and Martin Arnold have in common? Whereas a wealth of critics have diagnosed contemporary art’s preoccupations with madness, depression and self-abuse as well as its tendency to cultivate an (anti-)aesthetics of the negative, the excremental and the abject (say, from the Vienna Action Group to Serrano, McCarthy or Delvoye), much less attention has been paid to how modern and contemporary artists and public have thrived on the destruction, disfiguration and obliteration of work by the artists and/or by that of others. From Artaud’s «terminal» notebooks to the recent upsurge in «erasure poetics», the history of «undoing» art deserves to be recounted in a positive mode and rescued from popular narratives of the decline and death of the avant-garde.<br>

  Abstract: M.D.: And then, of course, there are acts of disowning, refusal and obliteration perpetrated by artists upon the works of other artists. Among these, the success story of erasure poetics deserves our attention, if only because it has been ignored or relegated to the margins of literary and art history. Erasurism is rooted as much in contemporary philosophy’s deconstructionist turn as in Duchampian found objects and Situationist détournements, of which many of the examples examined below constitute both an extension and a critique. Recent and current developments in erasure art are closely associated with visual artists and writers (many of<br>

  Abstract: M.D.: Walker’s installation is about how art seeks to remediate history’s tragic flaws by revisiting some of its cardinal sins and canonical objects. Likewise, the canonical status enjoyed by Mallarmé and Proust looms large in Broodthaers’s and Bennequin’s erasure experiments. Like Broodthaers’s «IMAGE»,

  Book Title: Negative Cosmopolitanism-Cultures and Politics of World Citizenship after Globalization<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): TOMSKY TERRI<br>
  Abstract: From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective. In the twentieth century the world sought solutions through formal institutions of international governance such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank, but present-day responses to global realities are often more provisional, improvisational, and contingent. Tracing this uneven history in order to identify principal actors, contesting ideologies, and competing rhetoric, Negative Cosmopolitanism challenges the Kantian ideal of cosmopolitanism as the precondition for a perpetual global peace. Uniting literary scholars with researchers working on contemporary problems and those studying related issues of the past – including slavery, industrial capitalism, and corporate imperialism – essays in this volume scrutinize the entanglement of cosmopolitanism within expanding networks of trade and global capital from the eighteenth century to the present. By doing so, the contributors pinpoint the ways in which whole populations have been unwillingly caught up in a capitalist reality that has little in common with the earlier ideals of cosmopolitanism. A model for provoking new and necessary questions about neoliberalism, biopolitics, colonialism, citizenship, and xenophobia, Negative Cosmopolitanism establishes a fresh take on the representation of globalization and modern life in history and literature. Contributors Include Timothy Brennan (University of Minnesota), Juliane Collard (University of British Columbia), Mike Dillon (California State University, Fullerton), Sneja Gunew (University of British Columbia), Dina Gusejnova (University of Sheffield), Heather Latimer (University of British Columbia), Pamela McCallum (University of Calgary), Geordie Miller (Dalhousie University), Dennis Mischke (Universität Stuttgart), Peter Nyers (McMaster University), Liam O’Loughlin (Pacific Lutheran University), Crystal Parikh (New York University), Mark Simpson (University of Alberta), Melissa Stephens (Vancouver Island University), and Paul Ugor (Illinois State University).From climate change, debt, and refugee crises to energy security, environmental disasters, and terrorism, the events that lead nightly newscasts and drive public policy demand a global perspective.

  Abstract: Postcolonial theory has helped us understand the ways in which imperial cultures have claimed a version of cosmopolitanism as intrinsic to their civilizing missions. While consideration of the treatment of indigenous groups and the history of slavery have enabled a consistent critique of such claims, less attention has been paid to the ways in which other groups have been positioned in these dynamics, particularly in the settler colonies. The debates in neo-cosmopolitanism over the last decade have attempted to position such groups more centrally.

  Abstract: The writing of history is a fundamental theme in Michel de Certeau. However, it is not solely a methodological and epistemological issue. Indeed, we cannot understand Certeau’s contribution to the epistemology of history if we do not link it to the most original aspects of his perspective, which are to be found in what I would call the field of historical ontology. I will therefore first deal with his conception of historiography as a writing practice which produces ontological and political effects.

  Book Title: The History Problem-The Politics of War Commemoration in East Asia<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawai'i Press<br>
  Author(s): Saito Hiro<br>
  Abstract: Seventy years have passed since the end of the Asia-Pacific War, yet Japan remains embroiled in controversy with its neighbors over the war’s commemoration. Among the many points of contention between Japan, China, and South Korea are interpretations of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, apologies and compensation for foreign victims of Japanese aggression, prime ministerial visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, and the war’s portrayal in textbooks. Collectively, these controversies have come to be called the “history problem." But why has the problem become so intractable? Can it ever be resolved, and if so, how? To answer these questions, Hiro Saito mobilizes the sociology of collective memory and social movements, political theories of apology and reconciliation, psychological research on intergroup conflict, and philosophical reflections on memory and history.<br>

  Abstract: The focus of the history problem, the Asia-Pacific War, was not a single, clearly bounded event. Instead, it evolved through a series of armed conflicts between Japan and China that began with the Mukden Incident in September 1931 and eventually led to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in July 1937. Japan then proceeded to war with the United States and other Allied powers in December 1941 and quickly advanced to the Pacific and Southeast Asia. But the tide of war began to turn at the Battle of Midway in June 1942, and Japan was increasingly overwhelmed by the<br>

  Abstract: The Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform (JSHTR), launched in January 1997, attacked postwar history education for forcing Japanese citizens to lose national pride: “Especially the modern historiography treats the Japanese people as if they were criminals who must continue to atone and apologize forever. This masochistic tendency became even stronger after the Cold War ended. Right now, history textbooks in Japan present the propagandas of the former enemy countries as historical facts.”¹ JSHTR members also met with Minister of Education Kosugi Takashi, trying to persuade him to reject masochistic tendencies— the increased descriptions of Japan’s past wrongdoings—in history<br>

These actors included the government, political parties, and NGOs in Japan; the governments, NGOs, and victims of Japan’s past wrongdoings in South Korea and China; and historians and educators from the three countries.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0r56">The History Problem</a><br>
  Abstract: At first glance, historians may not look like the best candidates for facilitating a resolution of the history problem. This is because historians have traditionally used the nation as a primary unit of analysis, helping to naturalize it as a primordial entity. They have also created professional associations and delimited their membership along national borders, consistent with the nationalist logic of self-determination; for example, when Japanese historians write about the history of Japan, they often talk among themselves without consulting with foreign historians who study Japan. This nationally bounded content focus and membership reinforces the logic of nationalism that divides<br>

In light of the field analysis of the history problem, my answer is cautiously affirmative—yes, it can be resolved if the governments and citizens in Japan, South Korea, and China find a way to unleash the potential of the historians’ debate to promote the cosmopolitan logic of commemoration. My affirmative answer is cautious because nationalist commemorations, focusing on the suffering of conationals without sufficient regard for foreign others, persist in the region, overwhelm historians’<br>

  Book Title: Encounter with the Plumed Serpent-Drama and Power in the Heart of Mesoamerica<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): Jiménez Gabina Aurora Pérez<br>
  Abstract: The Mixtec, or the people of Savi ("Nation of the Rain God"), one of the major civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica, made their home in the highlands of Oaxaca, where they resisted both Aztec military expansion and the Spanish conquest. This book presents and interprets the sacred histories narrated in the Mixtec codices, the largest surviving collection of pre-Columbian manuscripts in existence. In these screenfold books, ancient painter-historians chronicled the politics of the Mixtec from approximately a.d. 900 to 1521, portraying the royal families, rituals, wars, alliances, and ideology of the times. By analyzing and cross-referencing the codices, which have been fragmented and dispersed in far-flung archives, the authors attempt to reconstruct Mixtec history. Adding useful interpretation and commentary, Jansen and Perez Jimenez synthesize the large body of surviving documents into the first unified narrative of Mixtec sacred history.<br>

  Abstract: “Just as religious convictions determined social ethos and the way Native Americans behaved toward nature, ideology provided the frame for the recording and interpretation of history itself. . . . We see this reflected in the archetypal king of the archetypal civilized kingdom: Quetzalcoatl of Tollan.” So writes Maarten Jansen and Gabina Aurora Pérez Jiménez at the end of the first chapter in the long-awaited, innovative, and significant

  Chapter Three  DESCENT of the PLUMED SERPENT from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1wn0rc9">Encounter with the Plumed Serpent</a><br>
  Abstract: Human history, according to the Mesoamerican worldview, started with the First Sunrise. Before, there was darkness, a mysterious time of origins. The most impressive and complete expression of this concept is found in the Popol Vuh, the sacred book of the Quiché in Guatemala. The story begins in darkness and night (
                  chi quecum chi acab). The divine plan of creation is to bring about germination and dawn (ta chauaxoc, ta zaquiroc), connecting and even identifying the natural cycle of fertility with the cycle of day and night. Humanity, which exists within these cycles, is referred to as “people of light”<br>

  Abstract: The history of the lineages begins with the warmth and energy of the first rising of Lord Sun (Iya Ndicandii), who, with his rays of life-giving power and his call to work and glory, created a human world of knowledge and seeing while the past became a time of darkness and mystery, solid and cold as stone. The

  Abstract: To appraise Irish theatre of the recent past is an ominous task; to attempt to predict what might be remembered in the future a treacherous one. From 1990 to mid-2006 the Irish Playography database lists 842 plays, devised pieces and adaptations produced in Ireland by Irish theatre companies and other commercial bodies. Since 1990 critical interest in Irish theatre has grown rapidly, spurred on in part by the Abbey Theatre centenary in 2004 and reassessments of its history, in part by the emergence of a vibrant new generation of playwrights and the international success of a handful of Irish directors<br>

  Abstract: Though the topic has received little scholarly attention, Levinas’s
                  Otherwise Than Beingcontains the strongest recent defense of sincerity.¹ Despite this neglect, Levinas’s preference for sincerity over its typically better-esteemed alternative, authenticity, marks one of the most intriguing moments in the history of self-congruence. As the last chapter demonstrates, Levinas goes so far as to champion sincerity as a virtual synonym for both responsibility and subjectivity. In words taken from hisHumanism of the Other(1972), ”Sincerity . . . is the very responsibility for others” (HO69); ”Is subjectivity not sincerity—putting oneself out in the open, which is<br>

  Book Title: The Illiberal Imagination-Class and the Rise of the U.S. Novel<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): Shapiro Joe<br>
  Abstract: Through close readings of the works of foundational U.S. novelists, including Charles Brockden Brown, Hugh Henry Brackenridge, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, James Fenimore Cooper, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joe Shapiro demonstrates that while voices of economic egalitarianism and working-class protest find their ways into a variety of early U.S. novels, these novels are anything but radically dialogic; instead, he argues, they push back against emergent forms of class consciousness by working to naturalize class inequality among whites.

  Book Title: Holocaust Monuments and National Memory-France and Germany since 1989<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Carrier Peter<br>
  Abstract: Since 1989, two sites of memory with respect to the deportation and persecution of Jews in France and Germany during the Second World War have received intense public attention: the Vélo d'Hiver (Winter Velodrome) in Paris and the Monument for the Murdered Jews of Europe or Holocaust Monument in Berlin. Why is this so? Both monuments, the author argues, are unique in the history of memorial projects. Although they are genuine "sites of memory", neither monument celebrates history, but rather serve as platforms for the deliberation, negotiation and promotion of social consensus over the memorial status of war crimes in France and Germany. The debates over these monuments indicate that it is the communication among members of the public via the mass media, rather than qualities inherent in the sites themselves, which transformed these sites into symbols beyond traditional conceptions of heritage and patriotism.<br>

Following the renaming of streets and the removal or modification of monuments in the eastern sector of the city from 1989, and parallel to negotiations over the possible reconstruction of the Hohenzollern Palace, the debate over the planned Holocaust Monument exemplified the problematical cultural and symbolic transformation of this city prior to and following<br>

  Abstract: Without denying the importance of the postmodernist approach to the narrative form and rhetorical strategies of historiography, the author, one of Germany's most prominent cultural historians, argues here in favor of reason and methodical rationality in history. He presents a broad variety of aspects, factors and developments of historical thinking from the 18th century to the present, thus continuing, in exemplary fashion, the tradition of critical self-reflection in the humanities and looking at historical studies as an important factor of cultural orientation in practical life.<br>

  Abstract: Current discussions on the theory of history stress the poetical and rhetorical character of historiography; yet it is precisely this character that is generally neglected in the self-awareness and self-understanding of most professional historians. There is a good deal of postmodernism in the quest for rhetoric and aesthetics in modern historiography because the modernism of historiography is defined by it’s academic or, in a broader sense of the word, its scientific character. The widespread and deeply rooted opinion of academic historians, as well as of postmodernist theorists of history, is that this scientific character stands in opposition to rhetoric and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1x76fc2">History</a><br>
  Abstract: “Narrativity” and “objectivity” seem to be contradictory characterizations of historical studies. The category of narrativity brings historical studies close to literature; it discloses the literary character of historiography, and the linguistic procedures and principles which constitute “history” as a meaningful and sensible representation of the past in the cultural practices of historical memory. Objectivity, on the other hand, is a category that discloses a certain kind of historical knowledge, gained through the methodically-ruled procedures of research and that has furnished it with a solid validity jutting over the field of arbitrary meaning.<br>

  Abstract: Most works on historiography have been done within the framework of a national history.² A broader perspective is related to European or Western historiography³, or to the historiography of non-Western cultures. The latter mainly deals with a single country or a single culture such as China⁴ or India.⁵ Comparative studies have been rare so far.⁶ There are a lot of reasons for this but I will only mention two: the difficulty of combining the competences of research in different historical cultures, and the dominance of Western historical thinking in historical studies even in non-Western countries.

  Abstract: Historical studies as an academic discipline is under discussion, which treats its roots, functions and principles in a way that render them at the same time satisfactory and uncomfortable. The satisfaction may result from the new attention history has got in the realm of the humanities. One of the most dominating issues here is memory and its role in human culture. “Memory” covers the entire field of dealing with the past, thus including the realm of history as a subject matter and as a mode of recalling the past into life of its representation in the cultural framework of human<br>

They extended their protests to what they considered the pleasure-denying restraints of bourgeois society and desired “to liberate man from all the repressions of social life.”¹ Repression meant not just police but a wide spectrum of social activities—wage labor, sexual restraint, industrial hierarchy, and academic discipline. As in other Western nations, universities became the launching pad of their assaults. The most liberal institution provided cover for adversaries of the dominant social/political order<br>

  Abstract: Wage earners took advantage of the momentary weakness of state power in the middle of May to initiate the largest strike wave in French history. The fact that student radicals looked to workers to make the revolution was less important in sparking strikes than the divisions among political elites. What has been called the “political opportunity structure” encouraged the extension of the unrest to wage earners.¹ Even some members of the Gaullist majority wavered in support for the government. As in 1789, 1848, and 1871, cleavages within ruling groups promoted popular revolt. Both student and worker actions were parts of<br>

Like their counterparts throughout the world, they felt that morality and history were on their side. Revolutionary artists reflected this sentiment in posters, such as “May 68: The Beginning of a Long Struggle” (see figure 15). Several books published at the end of 1968 carried the title

  Book Title: Chinese Landscape Painting as Western Art History-  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Purtle Jennifer<br>
  Abstract: This is a provocative essay of reflections on traditional mainstream scholarship on Chinese art as done by towering figures in the field such as James Cahill and Wen Fong. James Elkins offers an engaging and accessible survey of his personal journey encountering and interpreting Chinese art through Western scholars' writings. He argues that the search for optimal comparisons is itself a modern, Western interest, and that art history as a discipline is inherently Western in several identifiable senses. Although he concentrates on art history in this book, and on Chinese painting in particular, these issues bear implications for Sinology in general, and for wider questions about humanistic inquiry and historical writing. Jennifer Purtle's Foreword provides a useful counterpoint from the perspective of a Chinese art specialist, anticipating and responding to other specialists’ likely reactions to Elkins's hypotheses.<br>

The European “dark ages” is the exemplary case, though its darkness is now widely contested and redistributed among a number of different cultures. The mid-third millennium BC in the Middle East, the founding centuries of Rome, and “Dynasty 0” in Egypt are also examples of periods whose sequences may always be inadequately known. Elsewhere and further back in history the gaps grow wider, and the known objects fewer and farther between.

While an autobiography is an account of the life of an individual written by that individual, utopian narrative offers a vision of an ideal place and social system for a collective. In fact, according to Robert F. Sayre, autobiography and utopia indicate polarities: between experience and prophecy, self and society, private and public or emotional unity and rational order (Sayre 1972, 21, 23). Both forms have firmly marked their presence in the culture and history of Australia. Autobiography, as Joy Hooton writes, has always been a prolific genre<br>

It is precisely Homer’s originarity—the fact that he precedes even the beginnings of historiography—that attracts the attention of both philosophers in relation to the event that he translates into verse. The reason is clear: The poem does not deal with just one event in Western history, though this is indeed remarkable in itself. Rather, it deals with the

An initial interpretative template is provided by the fissuring of temporality and history—or at least by their noncoincidence—that is present in different ways in all three of the aforementioned authors.

  Abstract: With Simone Weil, we confront a different scenario. For her, origin does not collapse under the weight of historical catastrophe. But this is not so because history—in particular, modern history—is conceived in more positive terms. On the contrary, we could say that in many ways Weil emphasizes origin’s negative characteristics. It is merely that, unlike Arendt, the negative in Weil does not affect origin from the outside principally because it is already embroiled in it. The modern therefore is not ailing because it betrays origin, but precisely because it fulfills it in all its unbearably antinomic features. Origin<br>

  Book Title: Sexual Disorientations-Queer Temporalities, Affects, Theologies<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): MOORE STEPHEN D.<br>
  Abstract: Sexual Disorientations brings some of the most recent and significant works of queer theory into conversation with the overlapping fields of biblical, theological and religious studies to explore the deep theological resonances of questions about the social and cultural construction of time, memory, and futurity. Apocalyptic, eschatological and apophatic languages, frameworks, and orientations pervade both queer theorizing and theologizing about time, affect, history and desire. The volume fosters a more explicit engagement between theories of queer temporality and affectivity and religious texts and discourses.<br>

  Abstract: Taking on himself the oppositions that generate the discourse of literary history, Hart Crane assumes a sacrificial role in American poetry. Just as Emily Dickinson dissects Christian and transcendental poetics, Crane plays against each other his two major influences—an Eliotic formalism with its roots in French Symbolism, and a Whitmanic organicism.¹ Crane has been repeatedly judged a failure on the grounds that his Symbolist and Whitmanic visions are incompatible; less often, he has been defended on the same grounds. For example, Sherman Paul sees that the “‘confusion’ in Crane’s work is not inadvertent, as Tate and others believe, but<br>

  Book Title: Return from Exile - Rückkehr aus dem Exil-Exiles, Returnees and Their Impact in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Verlag der österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften<br>
  Author(s): PRISCHING MANFRED<br>
  Abstract: The tremendous loss to the humanities and social sciences in the 20th century resulting from the expulsion of thousands of scholars and artists from Austria and Central Europe has been well documented. The present collection of articles deals with a related but under-researched aspect – it combines analyses of the complex bureaucratic and the ideological obstacles which exiled scholars from a wide range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences and creative artists faced when they were willing to return and specific essays documenting the varying opportunities for individual returnees to influence the development of their different disciplines after the end of the Nazi tyranny. The 27 essays highlight the roles of a number of returnees as generous mentors for younger scholars and their encouragement of modernization and internationalization in an atmosphere of stagnation and provincialism in the universities. Eminent experts in history, philosophy or political science who had returned were hampered by the denial of full academic appointments despite their highly stimulating initiatives, while theatre directors had a relatively strong impact on the programs in the theaters and the other media. The volume also illustrates personal factors, including the understandable hesitation of prominent intellectuals such as Oskar Morgenstern or Ernst Krenek to give up the advantages of US American citizenship for academic positions, especially in a country exposed to political threats in the Cold War; but the essays also bring out the fact that quite a few of the émigrés remained exiles on both sides of the Atlantic. A particular strength of the volume is the detailed consideration of the fortunes and the influence of the impressive array of exiled Austrian economists. Many of them returned from Britain, helping to shape economic theory and Austrian economic policy, even though necessarily mainly from outside the universities, while transatlantic exiles largely remained in the USA.<br>

  Abstract: The year 2015 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the closure of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). The council, which broadly aimed at aligning the Church with the modern world, is considered the most significant event in the history of contemporary Roman Catholicism. The impact of the council on women religious, who engaged with the reforms with unprecedented enthusiasm, far exceeded the changes expected by the hierarchy of the Church. The decline of religious life is often blamed on the Second Vatican Council, but this book documents and demonstrates the greater complexity of the issues involved.<br>

  Book Title: The Ambiguous Allure of the West-Traces of the Colonial in Thailand<br>
  Publisher: Hong Kong University Press, HKU<br>
  Author(s): Chakrabarty Dipesh<br>
  Abstract: The book brings studies of modern Thai history and culture into dialogue with debates in comparative intellectual history, Asian cultural studies, and postcolonial studies. It takes Thai Studies in new directions through case studies of the cultural hybridity and ambivalences that have emerged from the manifold interactions between Siam/Thailand and the West from 1850 to the present day. Central aims of The Ambiguous Allure of the West are to critique notions of Thai "uniqueness" or "exceptionalism" and locate Thai Studies in a broader, comparative perspective by arguing that modern Siam/Thailand needs to be understood as a semicolonial society. In contrast to conservative nationalist and royalist accounts of Thai history and culture, which resist comparing the country to its once-colonized Asian neighbours, this book's contributors highlight the value of postcolonial analysis in understanding the complexly ambiguous, interstitial, liminal and hybrid character of Thai/Western cultural interrelationships. At the same time, by pointing to the distinctive position of semicolonial societies in the Western-dominated world order, the chapters in this book make significant contributions to developing the critical theoretical perspectives of international cultural studies. The contributors demonstrate how the disciplines of history, anthropology, political science, film and cultural studies all enhance these contestations in intersecting ways, and across different historical moments. Each of the chapters raises manifold themes and questions regarding the nature of intercultural exchange, interrogated through theoretically critical lenses. This book directs its discussions at those studying not only in the fields of Thai and Southeast Asian studies but also in colonial and postcolonial studies, Asian cultural studies, film studies and comparative critical theory.<br>

                  modern South Asia. Surprising, because Thai history provides an obvious, and almost text-book, study in contrast to South Asian history of the modern period. Thailand is another and proximate Asian country that has experienced the gravitational pull of Europe over all its questions and agitations to do with becoming “modern”. Yet, unlike India, it was never formally colonized. Thai and Indian nationalisms, while showing some shared tensions over cultural domination by the West, have some significant differences that should engage<br>

  Abstract: While Siamese/Thai culture, both historically and today, is widely recognized, at times even eulogized, for its pervasive syncretism, theories of cultural hybridity have rarely been used to analyse the patterns of cultural borrowing and fusion in the country. This is largely because accounts of cultural hybridity have emerged from and remain closely identified with postcolonial studies. As Marwan Kraidy notes, “Standing on the shoulders of the disciplines that debated syncretism, 
                  mestizaje, and creolization, postcolonial theory repopularized the term ‘hybridity’ to explicate cultural fusion” (Kraidy 2005, 57). As I noted in my earlier chapter, Siam/Thailand’s lack of a colonial history means<br>

  Abstract: It is generally recognized that “liturgical theology,” as a notion or a discipline, owes its existence to the great Orthodox theologian of the last century, Fr. Alexander Schmemann. Liturgical theology, as Fr. Alexander understood it, is distinct from liturgiology, the study of the history and development of liturgical rites through (primarily) liturgical texts, and from a theology of liturgy, understood as a fundamental dimension of theology of worship. Both these disciplines are impor tant—indeed liturgical theology depends upon them—but liturgical theology, as Fr.

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

  Abstract: There are four things that follow upon revelation, that keep revelation present and complete it—completion in a sense other than its completion at the death of the last apostle. Revelation is first communicated by the words and deeds that make salvation history and which culminate in the Paschal Mystery. “The things we have heard from our fathers,” however, “we will not hide from their children, but tell them to the next generation, the children yet to be born” (Ps 78: 3–4).

  Abstract: God speaks to us, and his speaking demands an answer; he accomplishes our salvation in history, and that accomplishment commands a response. The first answer is the prayer of the Church in praise and thanksgiving, in words first taught to us by God in the Psalms; the first response is a re-actualization of the work of salvation in the liturgy, especially in Baptism and the Eucharist. A second response is the repetition of the word of God in evangelizing and catechesis and preaching, and the extension of God’s salvation of us in the works of love we do for others.<br>

  Abstract: Despite their pronounced differences, dickinson and Whitman are looking-glass reflections of each other and of America; although, as in facing mirrors, each one’s work is also the inverse of the other. One crux of this mutual reflection is their shared figural traditions of American culture. These originate in the biblical typologies that promised to align not only spiritual and mundane worlds, but the extensions of these into self, community, history, and God. Each practices and also tests this habit of figural alignment. The poetry of each is figurally complex, in ways often overlooked in Whitman (who can seem like the<br>

  Abstract: There is a long, if somewhat sporadic, history of scholarship acknowledging both Whitman and Dickinson as humorists.¹ Still, these poets’ exaggerated or hyperbolic claims are often read seriously, making Whitman seem egotistical and Dickinson depressed or without self-esteem. In this essay, we argue that the figure of hyperbole is both intrinsically linked with humor and a key element in what makes both poets’ work at once colloquially familiar and radically disorienting. For Whitman and Dickinson the use of hyperbole extends other features of their work that defamiliarize and disorient readers’ values, perceptions, and cognitive processes, while simultaneously creating the effect<br>

  Book Title: The Spirit of God-Short Writings on the Holy Spirit<br>
  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Clifford Catherine E.<br>
  Abstract: Yves Congar was the most significant voice in Catholic pneumatology in the twentieth century. This new collection of short pieces makes his thought accessible to a broad range of readers - scholars, teachers, ecumenists and laity - and thus helps to ensure that an important theological voice, one that influenced many of the documents of the Second Vatican Council, continues to be heard.
      The Spirit of Godbrings together for the first time eight of Yves Congar's previously untranslated writings on the Holy Spirit composed after Vatican II (from 1969 to 1985). Two of these selections offer general overviews of Congar's pneumatology, a pneumatology based upon Scripture and the Tradition of the Church, but articulated in conversation with philosophers, ecumenical partners and non-believers. Other articles make clear the historical context of Vatican II's pneumatology and the Holy Spirit's crucial influence upon the unfolding of history and upon the moral life, the efficacy of the sacraments and, especially, upon ecclesial life.The writings inThe Spirit of Godhave been translated and edited by a team of scholars familiar with the work of the French Dominican theologian. An introduction situates each of the writings historically and highlights its theological significance. A bibliography lists Congar's publications on the Holy Spirit, the major articles and books written about his pneumatology, and the major scholarly resources to which Congar made reference in the notes that accompanied these writings. An index of biblical references and of personal names is also included.<br>

First, it had deep psychological roots in a confrontation with aspects of his own nature; overcoming Dostoevsky, for Gorky, was a process of self-overcoming. Second, this process of self-overcoming became linked with a central effort of Gorky’s literary and cultural writings—the task of overcoming Russian history, the painful legacy of violence and disorder in Russian man and life, all that he once called “our most implacable enemy—our past.”² And third, this overcoming ultimately took on the dimensions of a struggle between worldviews,<br>

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

  Abstract: This book singles out translation as a way of talking about literary history and theory, philosophy, and interpretation. Vladimir Nabokov is its case study. The advantage of making Nabokov a case study for an investigation of questions of translation is obvious. It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps as no other place, first in the USSR and now Russia, Moscow’s Exhibition of Achievements of the People’s Economy, known widely as the VDNKh, has always operated as a sensitive seismograph of the country’s ambitions and failures. An expansive complex to the north of Moscow’s center, it has lived through several stages of construction throughout its history, each reflecting a particular moment in the developments of Soviet and post-Soviet economy, science, culture, and, most remarkably, ideology. The park opened in its initial form in 1939, with major additions during the first half of the 1950s.¹ In subsequent years the<br>

  Book Title: Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHOTT ROBIN MAY<br>
  Abstract: Any glance at the contemporary history of the world shows that the problem of evil is a central concern for people everywhere. In the last few years, terrorist attacks, suicide bombings, and ethnic and religious wars have only emphasized humanity's seemingly insatiable capacity for violence. In Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil, Robin May Schott brings an international group of contemporary feminist philosophers into debates on evil and terrorism. The invaluable essays collected here consider gender-specific evils such as the Salem witch trials, women's suffering during the Holocaust, mass rape in Bosnia, and repression under the Taliban, as well as more generalized acts of violence such as the 9/11 bombings, the Madrid train station bombings, and violence against political prisoners. Readers of this sobering volume will find resources for understanding the vulnerability of human existence and what is at stake in the problem of evil.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0w2">Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil</a><br>
  Author(s) Schott Robin May<br>
  Abstract: If anyone should think that evil is a problem of the past and not of the present, a glance at the history of the twentieth century proves otherwise. In that century, the atrocities of war escalated dramatically; between 1900 and 1990, there were over four times as many war deaths as in the preceding four hundred years. In 1990 battlefields included Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Mozambique, Peru, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Tibet (Vickers 1993, 2). To these one must add the battles of the Gulf War and the genocides in<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0w2">Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil</a><br>
  Author(s) Denike Margaret<br>
  Abstract: In part, this chapter takes up a challenge that Michel Foucault (1989) posed in an interview and that he himself had entertained throughout his genealogical histories of madness and sexuality. The challenge, specifically, is “to write a political history of truth,” a history—or histories—that ascertain the kinds of power relations that are implicated in the production and circulation of knowledge, and particularly, in the “official discourses” that are accepted as “true.” Such a genealogical approach, as Foucault defined it in the context of this interview (1989, 137–39), concerns the truth games played with “sex” and “sexuality,” though<br>

  Abstract: In the course of his intellectual career, Yuri M. Lotman has applied his mind to a wide range of disciplines: aesthetics, poetics, semiotic theory, the history of culture, mythology, and cinema, in addition to the principle themes of the history of Russian literature of which he is Professor at the University of Tartu in Estonia.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0xk">Reading Eco</a><br>
  Author(s) Capozzi Rocco<br>
  Abstract: The Island of the Day Before(1995) is Umberto Eco’s third encyclopedic postmodern collage and essay-novel which focuses, among many other things, on the practice of semiosis, on palimpsests, on meta-narrativity, and on the connection between “knowledge and power.”¹ Capitalizing on three most significant heterogeneous historical eras, the XIVth and XVIIth Centuries (two extraordinary periods of history marked by revolutionary transformations in all sectors of society),² and the XXth Century (an era exemplified by frequent changes and by so called postmodern pastiches and recyclings of every cultural phenomenon from the past) Eco’s trilogy³ illustrates how man’s eternal quest for knowledge<br>

  Abstract: In the introduction, we saw that Leni Yahil (1964), as well as other historians and thinkers, considered the “ image of man” during the Holocaust the central question with which scholarship of the period must contend. As noted, Yahil claimed, “the main thing that prompts us to study history—even of the distant past, but certainly in the case of the Holocaust—is the problem of the figure of man. . . . It is, therefore, inconceivable that research of the Holocaust period would not focus primarily on man, evaluating human actions and be havior.”¹ In reality, however, historical research<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005sns">Signs and Society</a><br>
  Abstract: One of the puzzles of the intellectual history of the “pragmatic” turn in contemporary linguistics is the fact that the American mathematician and philosopher Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914), who developed a graphic formalism for evaluating the logical precision of scientific concepts, continues to be an important inspiration for the development of approaches to language that move beyond the synchronic, descriptive, and generative perspectives characteristic of the mainstream of linguistics scholarship. Many students of language first encountered Peirce’s semiotic ideas in the early 1920s in the ten pages of excerpts printed as an appendix to Ogden and Richards’s

  Abstract: Having spent more than twenty-five years thinking about social change in Oceania, in particular about the historical changes reflected in the mythological narratives of Palau (Belau), I did not anticipate how difficult the challenge would be to consider—prompted by the invitation to participate in today’s panel—sudden, rapid, or traumatic change. Would this mere augmentation of the rate of acceleration necessitate a dramatic reformulation of the almost canonical post-Sahlins model for studying the “anthropology of history” as the transformation of the structures of reproduction?

My paper, “Times of the Signs: Modalities of History and Levels of Social Structure in Belau” (Parmentier 1985b), tried to synthesize Fernand Braudel, Meyer Fortes, and Marshall Sahlins by using Charles S.

  Abstract: Televised history has become the focus of growing academic research, which examines its uniqueness compared to the tradition of written history, and emphasizes its significant role in shaping collective memory. Film and television became central mechanisms of memory construction during the second half of the twentieth century and Western scholarship has long been emphasizing the power of fictional as well as documentary film in the representation of history¹ and defending television’s capabilities to “mediate” history successfully against those who doubt it.² According to Edgerton, televisual characteristics such as immediacy, dramatization, personalization, and intimacy, all shape the medium’s interaction with the<br>

  Abstract: In the past three decades, Israel’s history museums have gradually started to gain an important role within the public arena. Museums have attempted to compete with the teaching of history in schools, with the textbooks, as well as with TV programs and contents obtained through the Internet, by including short and focused captions, historic photographs, original items, reconstruction of buildings, and films. Many museums are currently successful in illustrating “boring” and distant historic issues in a captivating manner, and are thus a factor to be taken into consideration.

  Abstract: Between 1948 and 1967 the story of Kfar Etzion, one of the best-known cases of heroism in Israel’s War of Independence, became the defining myth in religious Zionism. No other story or single event in the history of religious Zionism has attained such mythical proportions and had so much influence on religious Zionists. The essence of religious-Zionist belief, how to live a life of purity and holiness and how to die a hero’s death, all for the sanctification of God’s name (

  Abstract: The question “What is memory to history?” has occupied and continues to occupy many historians.

  Abstract: To consider seriously cosmopolitan ideals (in Part I of this volume) is to engage universalism of one or more sorts—moral, political, economic, religious, and cultural. It is to take up notions of universal and equal intrinsic worth, the dignity of all persons, and border-blind, history-blind, color-blind, money-blind, gender-blind (and so on) rights and responsibilities. And it is to entertain worldviews in which tribal, local, regional, national, and other differences are mere artifacts of time, inessential contingencies, instances of good luck or bad fortune, and facts that cannot serve as bases for reason-based values and actions.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2005tww">The Essential Caputo</a><br>
  Abstract: The history of Western metaphysics, according to Martin Heidegger, is a centuries-old “oblivion of Being” (
                  Seinsvergessenheit), the shadow of which reaches all the way from Anaximander to Nietzsche (WM, l l/210).¹ If Heidegger himself claims to have recalled Being itself, Being in its truth, Western metaphysics has contented itself with various counterfeits for Being, either with generic categorizations of beings in general, or with a causal first-being, a being which causes other beings. No matter how loudly it protests to the contrary, in metaphysics Being is forsaken in favor of beings. Yet the followers of Thomas Aquinas have argued with<br>

  Book Title: The Spirits of Crossbones Graveyard-Time, Ritual, and Sexual Commerce in London<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hausner Sondra L.<br>
  Abstract: Every month, a ragtag group of Londoners gather in the site known as Crossbones Graveyard to commemorate the souls of medieval prostitutes believed to be buried there-the "Winchester Geese," women who were under the protection of the Church but denied Christian burial. In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

The Borough’s social and architectural roots lie deep in English history, then, but the beginnings of the Southwark we see today are best dated to the central Middle Ages, around the turn of the first millennium, when the area begins to become a diverse location of high-ranking church officials, religious institutions, and foreign travelers on their way to London.

  Book Title: The Colonial Legacy in France-Fracture, Rupture, and Apartheid<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Pernsteiner Alexis<br>
  Abstract: Debates about the legacy of colonialism in France are not new, but they have taken on new urgency in the wake of recent terrorist attacks. Responding to acts of religious and racial violence in 2005, 2010, and 2015 and beyond, the essays in this volume pit French ideals against government-sponsored revisionist decrees that have exacerbated tensions, complicated the process of establishing and recording national memory, and triggered divisive debates on what it means to identify as French. As they document the checkered legacy of French colonialism, the contributors raise questions about France and the contemporary role of Islam, the banlieues, immigration, race, history, pedagogy, and the future of the Republic. This innovative volume reconsiders the cultural, economic, political, and social realities facing global French citizens today and includes contributions by Achille Mbembe, Benjamin Stora, Françoise Vergès, Alec Hargreaves,Elsa Dorlin,and Alain Mabanckou, among others.<br>

  Author(s) Stora Benjamin<br>
  Abstract: In a book I published in 1991,
                  La gangrène et l’oubli,¹ I analyzed how a number of subtle lies and repressions, how denial and memory gaps, from across the Mediterranean, worked together to hide and distort the history of the Algerian War. Today, the memory of that war has surged to the fore massively, in both Algerian and French socie ties. However, behind that war hides another, even bigger piece of history, that of colonization. That “block” of history remains imposing and almost unmoving, precisely at the origin of the Algerian War; and there is still much to be explored<br>

  Abstract: Why is colonial, and postcolonial history in particular, so marginalized in French academic research? Is such a question even legitimate today? Certainly, if we consider colonization to be one of the major historic phenomena of the past two centuries, then there can be no doubt as to the pertinence of these questions. But then what accounts for such marginalization? Admittedly, I came to this question by way of two experiences.

  Abstract: Speaking about memory in France is to touch upon a crucial civic value,¹ one that is marked by a bad conscience, commemorations, and even manipulations.² A perfect history does not in fact exist,³ and nor does a perfect memory. If writing history is a process—it can be corrected, recontextualized, reformulated—memory is, at the moment it is articulated, a source of imagination, newfound awareness, and conflict. Its impact—both socially and politically—is immediate and indelible. It leaves its mark on the social imaginary.⁴ Memory is therefore an issue that should be considered with much precaution and distance. But<br>

  Book Title: The Year's Work in Nerds, Wonks, and Neocons-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHREIER BENJAMIN<br>
  Abstract: What happens when math nerds, band and theater geeks, goths, sci-fi fanatics, Young Republican debate poindexters, techies, Trekkies, D&D players, wallflowers, bookworms, and RPG players grow up? And what can they tell us about the life of the mind in the contemporary United States? With #GamerGate in the national news, shows like The Big Bang Theory on ever-increasing numbers of screens, and Peter Orzsag and Paul Ryan on magazine covers, it is clear that nerds, policy wonks, and neoconservatives play a major role in today's popular culture in America. The Year's Work in Nerds, Wonks, and Neocons delves into subcultures of intellectual history to explore their influence on contemporary American intellectual life. Not limiting themselves to describing how individuals are depicted, the authors consider the intellectual endeavors these depictions have come to represent, exploring many models and practices of learnedness, reflection, knowledge production, and opinion in the contemporary world. As teachers, researchers, and university scholars continue to struggle for mainstream visibility, this book illuminates the other forms of intellectual excitement that have emerged alongside them and found ways to survive and even thrive in the face of dismissal or contempt.<br>

  Abstract: The history of introducing Soviet-type political regimes in countries along the European border of the USSR has long been the subject of vehement scholarly and journalistic discussions. Historians still cannot agree on what plan exactly Stalin had in mind for Eastern Europe immediately after the war. Remarkably, Soviet and Western assessments of the post-war situation in the region coincided almost completely.

  Author(s) Balázs Imre József<br>
  Abstract: Histories of Hungarian literature written in the past two decades tend to describe ‘the episode of socialist realism’ as an imposed deviation or even a gap within the continuity of the Hungarian literary tradition. This idea of ‘interrupted continuity’ seems to be present also in the scholarship on twentieth-century Romanian literature. In his overview of the forerunners and beginnings of postmodernist literature in Romania, Mircea Cărtărescu, who is perhaps the best-known living Romanian novelist, speaks about the ‘frozen’ nature of Romanian culture and society during the 1950s and the 1960s.¹ Researchers of literary history in these countries seem to agree<br>

Jews, Jewish identity and history, and especially the Shoah were taboo topics for almost fifty years.² Romania was no exception to that rule.³ Having been a close ally of Nazi Germany and having implemented the mass murder of Jews and of Roma autonomously, Romania under communist rule felt an even more acute urge<br>

  CHAPTER SEVEN  Social Applications in the United States (1800s ce) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2050vqm">Eve and Adam</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter examines applications of Eve and Adam’s story to several social issues that were highly contested in the nineteenth century. While the chapter’s examination retains the preoccupation with Protestantism of the previous chapter (even as it adds voices from some new religious movements that arose out of Protestantism), it shifts the geographic locus from Europe to the United States. Since never in Western history had a culture produced more innovative readings of Genesis 1-3, or was a culture more determined to use the text in concrete social applications than nineteenth-century North America, this chapter will examine several of those<br>

  4  Between Theodicy and Despair from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt20d87sf">Levinas and the Trauma of Responsibility</a><br>
  Abstract: Levinas’s critique of narrative and the conception of the narrating subject that underlies it leads him to the issue of how time is synchronized in the philosophy of history, where the process of abstraction from the singular other is most prominent. By interpreting the significance of disparate events and integrating them into a coherent account, the disciplinary approaches of history typically assume a formal conception of time, in which a linear chronology can be represented by consciousness. In other words, past events are treated as intentional objects. This synchronization of time entails generalizing from people’s experiences, selectively emphasizing certain elements<br>

  Book Title: Echoes of the Tambaran-Masculinity, history and the subject in the work of Donald F. Tuzin<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): Roscoe Paul<br>
  Abstract: In the Sepik Basin of Papua New Guinea, ritual culture was dominated by the Tambaran —a male tutelary spirit that acted as a social and intellectual guardian or patron to those under its aegis as they made their way through life. To Melanesian scholarship, the cultural and psychological anthropologist, Donald F. Tuzin, was something of a Tambaran, a figure whose brilliant and fine-grained ethnographic project in the Arapesh village of Ilahita was immensely influential within and beyond New Guinea anthropology. Tuzin died in 2007, at the age of 61. In his memory, the editors of this collection commissioned a set of original and thought provoking essays from eminent and accomplished anthropologists who knew and were influenced by his work. They are echoes of the Tambaran. The anthology begins with a biographical sketch of Tuzin's life and scholarship. It is divided into four sections, each of which focuses loosely around one of his preoccupations. The first concerns warfare history, the male cult and changing masculinity, all in Melanesia. The second addresses the relationship between actor and structure. Here, the ethnographic focus momentarily shifts to the Caribbean before turning back to Papua New Guinea in essays that examine uncanny phenomena, narratives about childhood and messianic promises. The third part goes on to offer comparative and psychoanalytic perspectives on the subject in Fiji, Bali, the Amazon as well as Melanesia. Appropriately, the last section concludes with essays on Tuzin's fieldwork style and his distinctive authorial voice.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hbjj">Echoes of the Tambaran</a><br>
  Author(s) Gardner Don<br>
  Abstract: Don Tuzin left a magnificent corpus of work on the Ilahita Arapesh, one that presents a compelling analysis of two remarkable transitions in the history of a people. His work is also striking because of the sheer range of issues on which he focused his fine analytical eye; his work might focus on the emotions, dispositions and moral conflicts of particular persons or categories thereof (specific elders, initiands, or Christians, men, women) as readily as on the structural or historically contingent circumstances within which agents must act, and which tend to produce grand historical transformations. There are also significant essays<br>

  Abstract: In addition, he includes lengthy chapters on three areas not covered in the first book. First, he explores the role of the narrator, both verbal and visual, and the particular issues that arise out of narration in autobiographical comics. Second, Groensteen tackles the question of rhythm in comics, and the skill demonstrated by virtuoso artists in intertwining different rhythms over and above the basic beat provided by the discontinuity of the panels. And third he resets the relationship of comics to contemporary art, conditioned by cultural history and aesthetic traditions but evolving recently as comics artists move onto avant-garde terrain.<br>

  Abstract: In this final chapter, we are going to leave the domain of semiotic or narratological analysis and move onto the terrain of sociology of art, art history, and cultural history. It would undoubtedly be worth developing the following reflections into a full-length essay. However, it seems appropriate to include them in the present volume, since, as we shall see, they will ultimately lead us back, by another route, to the question of narration.<br>

  Book Title: Desi Divas-Political Activism in South Asian American Cultural Performances<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Mississippi<br>
  Author(s): Garlough Christine L.<br>
  Abstract: Case study chapters address the relatively unknown history of South Asian American rhetorical performances from the early 1800s to the present. Avant-garde feminist performances by the Post Natyam dance collective appropriate women's folk practices and Hindu goddess figures make rhetorical claims about hate crimes against South Asian Americans after 9/11. In
      Yoni ki Bat(a South Asian American version ofThe Vagina Monologues) a progressive performer transforms aspects of the Mahabharata narrative to address issues of sexual violence, such as incest and rape. Throughout the volume, Garlough argues that these performers rely on calls for acknowledgment that intertwine calls for justice and care. That is, they embed their testimony in traditional cultural forms to invite interest, reflection, and connection.<br>

  Abstract: One hundred years separate these evocations of flags and founding fathers in the name of minority exclusion.¹ Taken together, however, they reveal a good deal about the central dilemmas facing South Asian American community members today. In both moments, South Asian Americans have found themselves characterized as perpetual strangers at the door of American democracy. By raising the specter of the Other and promising protection from their fearsome “foreignness,” these appeals to the majority do not recognize the legitimacy of South Asians as citizens or neighbors.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: Let us step closer to the crucial questions of the present book. We just asked ourselves whether the decades that are now most often called “postmodernist” fit into any of the patterns of the philosophy of culture as understood until now or whether they signal a wide chasm between the “age of history” and the present or the future. We also asked ourselves whether an entirely new mode of understanding the philosophy of culture has to be forged, one that should be adapted to the new events of our contemporary time.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt284vhr">Postmodernism and Cultural Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: It may be useful to introduce at this point in the flow of our general narrative the following question: Is the current situation (in the first decade of the twenty-first century) entirely unique? Does humanity encounter it for the first time without any prior analogy? Is the dialectic between convulsive and buzzing relativity and separate zones of serene isolation totally unexpected? I said in a previous chapter that history may well be understood as a succession of unpredictable episodes, so devised or prepared by divine providence (or not), and that such episodes are meant to function each time as fresh,<br>

  Abstract: Assuming, as is often done in this book, that the few decades just before and after 1800 mark a major turning point in both Western and world history, we note primarily the enormous variety of responses to the coming of consciousness concerning the process of modernization and “Enlightenment,” as it occurs at that point and highlights it for us. I just gave a quick overview of the “hybridization” of conservatism and liberalism at the beginning of the nineteenth century (and earlier) as 
                  one of the responses. We can expand this view further, by showing how in the nineteenth and twentieth<br>

  Author(s) Rhee Helen<br>
  Abstract: Christian eschatology and otherworldliness have been used and misused throughout history. On the one hand, they were used by Christians to justify maintaining the socio-political or religious status quo resulting in either a tragic neglect of social injustice or a passivity toward social reforms in the present age.¹ On the other hand, they were used to justify socio-political and religious radicalism and violence to the point that Christianity may be seen in some quarters as a militant opponent of social process and tolerance.² While it is true that the eschatological orientation and “otherworldliness” of early Christian teachings did not directly<br>

                     Poetics, and there have been not a few suggestions to fill the gap. Before we turn to them, let us begin by remembering the definition of tragedy, for its part the most well-known sentence in literary criticism:<br>

                  rhētorikē, which means “art of the spoken word.” Right off, etymology indicates the role the ancients played in the subject of the present work. If Greco-Roman antiquity by itself did not invent the art of speaking—other, more ancient civilizations could lay claim to this honor—it did develop it in a special way and conceptualize it with an unprecedented rigor and richness. This art has occupied an important place in the history of Western culture, and it continues to exert a genuine influence, although less visibly present than before, on the<br>

  Abstract: The questions on the criteria of rigor in the humanities can be grouped around three words: reading, understanding, and knowing, and those that refer to their practical import, around two: usefulness and value. In the analysis of reading we shall take literary texts as examples, because the literary text is more complex than those in linguistics, history, philosophy, or theology. Reading Calderón’s 
                  La vida es sueño (Life is a Dream) we discover nuances of the phenomenon of reading that would not shine through in reading Ortega y Gasset’s essay The Dehumanization of Art. On the other hand, the conclusions about<br>

  Author(s) Russon John<br>
  Abstract: When I undertook graduate studies in the 1980s, the University of Toronto was internationally recognized as a center for study in the history of philosophy. The presence of Kenneth L. Schmitz in the department made it especially strong as a center for the study of Hegel’s philosophy, and I had the great privilege and pleasure of attending many courses that he taught on Hegel, Kant, and German idealism. The jewel in this crown was his graduate seminar on Hegel’s

  Abstract: The face of armed conflict changes every week and every day, but the underlying moral questions remain, remarkably, much the same. Taking this continuity as our point of departure, we focus in the present volume on some basic issues in ethics and philosophy that are related to the use of armed force as these were developed by thinkers in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. We do not remain in centuries-old history, however. Moving ahead from the historical and philosophical background, we also introduce several pressing issues of our own day.<br>

  Author(s) SYSE HENRIK<br>
  Abstract: Augustine is often referred to as the founder of just war doctrine. While that is not quite accurate, since Cicero and several of the earlier Church Fathers had already formulated the basic elements of the just war idea,¹ it is certainly true that Augustine would become the most influential of the early Christian teachers writing on the morality of war. He formulated his ideas at a crucial time in Church history, just when the Western Roman Empire was crumbling and Christianity had to accommodate to life in the world—a world that was showing few signs of an imminent end,<br>

  Author(s) SYSE HENRIK<br>
  Abstract: What protection does the natural environment merit in wartime? It was in the aftermath of the Vietnam War of 1961–75 that this question came into focus. Wars have always brought destruction in their wake; and the twentieth century was by no means the first to show concern for the effects of armed conflict on our natural surroundings. However, the Vietnam War does “stand out in modern history as one in which intentional anti-environmental actions were a major component of the strategy and tactics of one of the adversaries, one in which such actions were systematically carried out for many<br>

  Abstract: Paradoxically, the twentieth century witnessed both the bloodiest and most horrific carnage in the history of humankind and the first global attempts to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. From these unjust wars came a dawning sense that a just peace was necessary to prevent their recurrence and right the scales of injustice. But whereas in the past the victors would apportion blame to other states to redress wrongs and balance the scales of power, now their leaders came to realize that neither governments as abstract entities nor the “people” in whose name they committed such atrocities should be<br>

  5  OCCUPATION OF THE CENTER from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851kc">A Sacred Kingdom</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter offers an interpretation of Frankish liturgy in the Merovingian and early Carolingian period as a poetical and religious achievement coherent with the legal and political activities of bishops. The history of liturgy moves at a glacial pace, with changes of rituals or garments recorded only seldom and subtly over the centuries. Like episcopal law, liturgy also provided a deep connection of the Frankish bishops to the ancient past of the church. Liturgy involved bishops in a unique theatre of rituals and gestures repeated over many centuries. As in episcopal law, emphasis was laid on the duplication of antiquity.<br>

  CONCLUSION: from:

  Abstract: An ancient political question arose for the Carolingians, as it does still today: is it possible to yoke the bull of power? This study has examined the social and political doctrines of bishops from the Gallic Church of the fourth century to the Frankish Church of the mid-ninth century, a period of some five hundred years. In relying on conciliar records I have not tried to write a history of conciliar law, but rather to trace the formation of an intellectual elite within a warrior society, and to describe how this elite built and maintained its power and functionality across<br>

  Author(s) Miller Michael J.<br>
  Abstract: Totalitarian forms of government have affected the past century so profoundly that its history cannot be adequately understood without an investigation of the phenomenon of totalitarianism. such an investigation is not solely a subject for the particular fields of political science, sociology, or history. it is also a subject for philosophical reflection, that is to say, for a reflection that considers its object not in itself, separately from other fields of study, but rather within the horizon of reality as a whole.<br>

  Author(s) Hibbs Thomas S.<br>
  Abstract: Perhaps no alteration in the landscape of Anglo-American philosophy in the last thirty years has been more surprising, more sustained, and more fruitful than the resurgence of interest in the ethics of virtue. Most discussions of the history of twentieth-century moral philosophy trace the return of virtue to Elizabeth Anscombe’s essay from the late 1950s, “Modern moral philosophy.”¹ A jeremiad against Kantian and utilitarian ethical theories, Anscombe’s essay urged that, given the present state of philosophical ethics—with its incoherent conceptions of obligation, its lack both of terminological clarity and of an adequate philosophical psychology—we should banish ethics totally<br>

  CHAPTER 6  The Inspiration of Scripture from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt28520m">The Eyes of Faith</a><br>

                  sensus fidei/fidelium throughout the production, canonical selection, and ongoing reception/traditioning of the set canonical text constitutes its inspiration by the Holy Spirit. We have already seen how “inspiration” was not necessarily an explicit reason/criterion for inclusion of works in the canon, and that, in patristic times, there was a presumption regarding the inspiration of many writings circulating in local communities. Once works achieve canonical status, it is then that the notion of inspiration emerges, later in church history, as one way of<br>

  Abstract: All religions make cosmological claims, claims about the structure, nature, and purposes of the cosmos, but, like Judaism before it, Christianity from the beginning was of its essence cosmological, seeing human life both as dramatic, centered on a struggle to achieve a proper use of freedom, and as eschatological, receiving its orientation from beyond history. All was viewed against a cosmic background articulated in Scripture and preserved in the liturgy. The previous chapter described the abundant variety of expressions of transcendence, both the transcendence of the philosophers and that of the theologians, found in ancient Christianity and to the eve<br>

  Abstract: The previous two chapters traced the history of the practice and expression of a sense of transcendence, and the diminishment of an orientation to transcendence in recent centuries. Earlier, the third chapter gave some idea of the role of the arts in both fostering and diminishing the place of transcendence in life. This final chapter considers thinkers and movements outside the arts who have rebelled against the diminishment of transcendence and have proposed various alternatives as to how the transcendent dimension of life might be expressed today.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  The Methodology from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853bw">Destined for Liberty</a><br>
  Abstract: As we have seen, Wojtyła’s early writings indicate that he was conversant with the history of European philosophy. He knew Plato and Aristotle, was familiar with the Christian philosophy of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas, and moved knowledgeably among such modern thinkers as David Hume, Jeremy Bentham, Immanuel Kant, and Max Scheler. However, Wojtyła’s early work also proves that he reached beyond mere historical exegesis. The young thinker showed an impressive ability to integrate into his own work the thought of other philosophers. For example, in 
                  Lublin Lectures, Wojtyła borrowed from the twentieth-century psychology of the will, Aquinas’s metaphysics,<br>

  CHAPTER FIVE  MYSTICISM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: “
                  The most extreme sharpness and depth of thought belong to genuine and great mysticism,” Heidegger wrote in 1955.¹ The insight came to him far earlier. Joseph Sauer’s course in the history of medieval mysticism, which Heidegger took in 1910–11, was the beginning of a lifelong interest in Meister Eckhart.² In the Habilitationsschrift, Heidegger spoke of mysticism as the other side of the Middle Ages, “the living heart of medieval Scholasticism” (GA1 205–6).

  CHAPTER EIGHT  THE EFFORT TO OVERCOME SCHOLASTICISM from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Heidegger’s later critique of onto-theology is rooted in his earliest efforts to de-Christianize metaphysics. It is no longer disputable that he was directly inspired by Luther’s de-Hellenization of Christianity. Luther attempted to purify Christian theology of Greek metaphysics by dismantling the Aristotelian-Scholastic superstructure that had grown up over it; Heidegger undertook a complementary purification of metaphysics from Christian theology through a Destruktion of ontology down to its original Greek sources. I have argued that Heidegger’s appropriation of a Lutheran paradigm for the Destruktion of the history of ontology is not theologically neutral; on the contrary, it is theologically motivated. Heidegger’s<br>

  CHAPTER NINE  BEING-BEFORE-GOD IN THE MIDDLE AGES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2853gt">The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: Scholasticism did not leave the Jewish-Christian sense of history as it found it nor did it annul it. It sublated the early Christian understanding of time, fusing it with Hellenistic theoretical structures into a distinctively new way of being Christian. Greco-Roman “circular thinking” (the emphasis on the eternity of form) and Jewish-Christian historical thinking (the emphasis on the singularity of event), which initially tended to conflict with one another, achieved a precarious balance in Scholasticism. The Jewish-Christian historical sense was initially antagonistic to cultural and scientific life. There was no sense in building up culture when the Last Day was<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating the Sacred-Blasphemy and Sacrilege in a Multicultural Society<br>
  Publisher: ANU E Press<br>
  Author(s): WHITE KEVIN<br>
  Abstract: This cross-disciplinary exploration of the role of the sacred, blasphemy and sacrilege in a multicultural society brings together philosophers, theologians, lawyers, historians, curators, anthropologists and sociologists, as well as Christian, Jewish and Islamic and secular perspectives. In bringing together different disciplinary and cultural approaches, the book provides a way of broadening our conceptions of what might count as sacred, sacrilegious and blasphemous, in moral and political terms. In addition, it provides original research data on blasphemy, sacrilege and religious tolerance from a range of disciplines. The book is presented in four sections: Section I: Religion Sacrilege and Blasphemy in Australia. Section II: Sacrilege and the Sacred Section III: The State, Religion and Tolerance Section IV: The Future: Openness and Dogmatism.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jbjjq">Negotiating the Sacred</a><br>
  Author(s) Seyit Kuranda<br>
  Abstract: Islam today, it would seem, has become inflexible and intolerant towards the teachings and ideologies of the West. When in fact, its history shows that it has always been accommodating to other peoples and beliefs, especially Christianity and Judaism. Most people know something of Islam. For instance, that it is one of the three monotheisms or the Abrahamic faiths and that it has much in common with Christianity and Judaism. Yet, there is so much that we do not understand about Islam and its overall world view. Islam is centred on the notion of peace, justice and community, yet when<br>

  Author(s) Reuter Thomas<br>
  Abstract: The central highlands and some coastal areas of Bali are home to a little-known indigenous minority group, the 
                  Bali Aga or ′Mountain Balinese′. This paper focuses on ritual domains formed by clusters of Bali Aga ′villages′ (desa adat or desa ulu apad). These regional, spatially bounded and historically conceived networks are known as banua. The banua and its constituent desa form a sacred landscape inscribed by the memory of a continuous history of human settlement and migration, and re-inscribed through origin narratives and ritual performances at sacred sites of origin, which are marked by shrines or temples. This multi-layered process<br>

  Author(s) Winn Phillip<br>
  Abstract: The Banda Islands in central Maluku have long been a site of historical transformations. As a consequence, human relationships to land and place in the Bandas need to be understood in terms of dynamic processes of culture and history. In the pre-colonial period, the islands formed a key part of extensive trading networks reaching across the archipelago to link Maluku with the northern seaports of Java, the cosmopolitan city-state of Malacca in peninsular Malaysia, and ultimately to the Middle East, China and Europe. By the arrival of the first Europeans, the population of the islands included numbers of resident Malay<br>

  Author(s) JOAS HANS<br>
  Abstract: The notion that in significant parts of Eurasia the middle centuries of the first millennium BCE mark a significant transition in human cultural history, and that this period can be referred to as the Axial Age, has become widely, but not universally, accepted. Since the very term “Axial Age” is unfamiliar to many, we may begin with a brief explication of it. It has become common to refer to certain texts in literature, philosophy, and even theology as “classics,” that is, as enduring subjects of interpretation, commentary, and argument that make them, whenever they were first composed, contemporary and part<br>

  Abstract: Any view about the long-term history of religion turns on an interpretation of the Axial Age. What was the nature of the Axial revolution? This is sometimes spoken of the coming to be of a new tension “between the transcendental and mundane orders,” involving a new conception of the “transcendental.¹ But “transcendental” has more than one meaning. It can designate something like a “going beyond” the human world or the cosmos (1). But it also can mean the discovery or invention of a new standpoint from which the existing order in the cosmos or society can be criticized or denounced<br>

  Abstract: After the end of the cosmopolitism of the Enlightenment, Occidental uniqueness and superiority have become firm features of the Western self-understanding. Hegel’s statement that “the Oriental has to be excluded from the history of philosophy” (1940, 152) and Leopold Ranke’s echo that for understanding world history “one cannot start from the peoples of eternal standstill” (1888, viii) are two prominent examples for a conviction that became dominant in the historical disciplines.

  Abstract: Since the historicizing argument to be developed below runs counter to stronger trends and more widely shared approaches in the present discussion, it may be useful to begin with a brief indication of the main points at issue. To rehistoricize, or bring history back in, is—most obviously—to make a case for reemphasizing the Axial Age as a historical epoch, with at least approximately definable boundaries, rather than transfiguring its innovations and achievements into an ideal type of “axiality.” But it also means to pay more attention to the internal historicity of the epoch: changing constellations as well as<br>

In post-Partition India, Lahore felt a million miles further than Dubai.

  Abstract: Why did so many Punjabis insist that they never saw Partition coming? Was this the work of nostalgia or memories gone astray? Why did so many historians insist that Partition was inevitable? Were they victims of an inexorable faith in the power of historical explanation? Yet the players and writers of history often spoke the same language and frequently drifted into each other’s modes of explanation.

  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: In addition to war, terrorism, and unchecked military violence, modernity is also subject to less visible but no less venomous conflicts. Global in nature, these "culture wars" exacerbate the tensions between tradition and innovation, virtue and freedom. Internationally acclaimed scholar Fred Dallmayr charts a course beyond these persistent but curable dichotomies in Integral Pluralism: Beyond Culture Wars. Consulting diverse fields such as philosophy, literature, political science, and religious studies, Dallmayr equates modern history with a process of steady pluralization. This process, which Dallmayr calls "integral pluralism," requires new connections and creates ethical responsibilities.<br>

  Abstract: The western is arguably the most iconic and influential genre in American cinema. The solitude of the lone rider, the loyalty of his horse, and the unspoken code of the West render the genre popular yet lead it to offer a view of America's history that is sometimes inaccurate. For many, the western embodies America and its values. In recent years, scholars had declared the western genre dead, but a steady resurgence of western themes in literature, film, and television has reestablished the genre as one of the most important.<br>

More so than any other epoch in U.S. history, the American Old West has been mythologized in the collective unconscious of the country through the many iconic representations of this historical period in film.

The book of Exodus reports the tribulations endured by the Jews during their exile in Egypt, before they were led into the wilderness by Moses, but it also speaks of a promised land and of the “steadfast love” with which God guides the people to his “holy abode” (Exodus 15:13).

  Abstract: If one truth has emerged from the intense scholarly debate during the last two decades over the nature of Old Hollywood, it is that the writing of American film history must avoid the essentialist trap of considering the so-called classic text of that era as an undifferentiated flow of product whose watchwords were sameness and conformity. A correlative of this truth is that, even with its emphasis on package production (with each film in some sense a unique entity unto itself), New Hollywood filmmaking still offers regular forms of textuality that differ from those of the studio era only in<br>

In 1975, the New Zealand Parliament, for the first time since 1840, gave statutory recognition to the Treaty by setting up a tribunal to hear claims by Maori people that the Crown had failed to honour its guarantees under the Treaty.

How do two senses of identity relate—as believers and as citizens? These questions have been posed throughout both Christian and Muslim history, and a variety of answers have been given to them. Context has been a critically important factor in shaping not only the answers but also, prior to that, the very way in which the questions are shaped, as the following essays and presentations demonstrate.<br>

  Book Title: Power and the Past-Collective Memory and International Relations<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shain Yossi<br>
  Abstract: Only recently have international relations scholars started to seriously examine the influence of collective memory on foreign policy formation and relations between states and peoples. The ways in which the memories of past events are interpreted, misinterpreted, or even manipulated in public discourse create the context that shapes international relations.
      Power and the Pastbrings together leading history and international relations scholars to provide a groundbreaking examination of the impact of collective memory. This timely study makes a contribution to developing a theory of memory and international relations and also examines specific cases of collective memory's influence resulting from the legacies of World War II, the Holocaust, and September 11. Addressing concerns shared by world leaders and international institutions as well as scholars of international studies, this volume illustrates clearly how the memory of past events alters the ways countries interact in the present, how memory shapes public debate and policymaking, and how memory may aid or more frequently impede conflict resolution.<br>

  Abstract: During soccer’s 2008 European Cup, many German fans waved their flags jubilantly after the national team’s victories—continuing a new patriotic tradition that was especially pronounced during the 2006 World Cup of soccer hosted in Germany and in which the national team made it to the semifinals. Both times, it was difficult not to recall a much bleaker version of German nationalism that prevailed in the not-so-distant past.

Beyond the shockingly persistent rumors of some kind of Israeli–Jewish conspiracy behind the attacks in the first place, the policy aftermath—especially the global war on terror and the invasion of Iraq—was widely perceived as being pushed by “Jewish interests and actors.”¹ These most recent examples once again raise the question of who speaks on behalf of “Jewish political interests”—and once again generates interest in the complex interrelationship among various diasporas and Israel, as well as<br>

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Book Title: Ethics in Light of Childhood-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wall John<br>
  Abstract: Childhood faces humanity with its own deepest and most perplexing questions. An ethics that truly includes the world's childhoods would transcend pre-modern traditional communities and modern rational autonomy with a postmodern aim of growing responsibility. It would understand human relations in a poetic rather than universalistic sense as openly and interdependently creative. As a consequence, it would produce new understandings of moral being, time, and otherness, as well as of religion, rights, narrative, families, obligation, and power.
      Ethics in Light of Childhoodfundamentally reimagines ethical thought and practice in light of the experiences of the third of humanity who are children. Much like humanism, feminism, womanism, and environmentalism, Wall argues, a new childism is required that transforms moral thinking, relations, and societies in fundamental ways. Wall explores childhood's varied impacts on ethical thinking throughout history, advances the emerging interdisciplinary field of childhood studies, and reexamines basic assumptions in contemporary moral theory and practice. In the process, he does not just apply ethics to childhood but applies childhood to ethics-in order to imagine a more expansive humanity.<br>

Yet all too often children are considered merely undeveloped adults, passive recipients of care, occupying a separate innocence, or, perhaps, in need of being civilized.

  Abstract: IT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS to say that children are full human beings. But as the history sketched in the previous chapter shows, it is not easy to explain what exactly this means. Leading thinkers’ efforts to describe children’s full humanity have resulted in one or another form of oversimplification. Of course, such is the case for any person or group. It is to some extent inevitable that talk about humanity is dehumanizing. But for children in particular, the problem is complicated by the fact that they cannot, on the whole—nor should they—be held as responsible as adults for<br>

  Conclusion from:

  Abstract: THIS BOOK HAS BEEN exploring how the consideration of childhood should transform fundamental ethical understanding. More than just applying ethics to children, it has applied the experiences and perspectives of children to ethics. Since children are fully a third of all humanity, and since they are not morally reducible to adults, this transformation is no small matter. Reimagining ethics in light of childhood—and not just in light of adulthood—is challenging and often surprising. Philosophers and theologians throughout the ages have attempted this task from different angles, but the results of history show that much more work needs to<br>

  Abstract: History defies linearity. In a time when, at least in the Western world, major issues appeared to be settled and some even predicted the “end of history,” drama has suddenly erupted elsewhere—and especially in the Muslim world. A political arena that in many respects seemed relatively stagnant has unexpectedly been gripped by radical turmoil and revolutionary fervor. This does not mean that such turmoil is ever completely unprepared or unmotivated. Contrary to their portrayal (by some academics) as near-apocalyptic interruptions beyond intelligibility, revolutions have precursors or conditioning factors; usually they are the product of a deep social malaise, of<br>

  FOREWORD from:

  Author(s) Aronowitz Stanley<br>
  Abstract: John Sweeney, the leader of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), led a revolt of a gaggle of large unions and was elected American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) president in 1995, an unprecedented challenge in modern labor history to a sitting administration. Not since 1908 when an insurgency within the AFL opposed the reelection of its longtime leader, Samuel Gompers, and a group of industrial unions bolted from the AFL in 1935, had labor’s ranks been so divided.<br>

  Chapter 5  LABOR, RACE, AND THE MISSISSIPPI PRESS from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tv941">Covering for the Bosses</a><br>
  Abstract: Claude Ramsay, the crusty, barrel-chested president of the Mississippi AFL-CIO from 1959 to 1986, delivered a stem-winder of a speech at the University of Mississippi in 1966—a time when the fires of the civil rights struggle were still burning—that included a snapshot history of the labor movement, a discussion of the twin legacies of Samuel Gompers and Eugene Debs, and a withering analysis of how the state’s political and business leaders had failed working Mississippians. His best shots, however, came in a blistering indictment of the Mississippi press.<br>

  Author(s) Clarke Deborah<br>
  Abstract: Listening to these alleged responses to why the chicken crossed the road, no one could confuse one individual for the other. Faulkner, after all, has made his name as one of the most complex of the high modernists, with an incredible sensitivity for language and an obsession with the sense of place and the role of history in determining human identity and fate. Ford, on the other hand, was the great simplifier. He made his fortune by making cars easy—easy to drive, easy to repair, and easy to assemble. He had a simple formula for success—keep the prices<br>

  Author(s) GLEASON WILLIAM<br>
  Abstract: Despite the extensive attention paid by scholars to the philosophical underpinnings of the work of Charles Johnson—despite even the grandiose yet entirely fair claim by Johnson himself that “there is more engagement with philosophy—Western and Eastern—in my work than you will find anywhere in the history of black American literature” (Nash, “A Conversation,” 222)—certain philosophical traditions crucial to Johnson’s writing remain underexplored. Foremost among these is American pragmatism, a tradition whose concerns may at first seem far removed from the emphatically spiritual and idealistic vision foregrounded in Johnson’s creative work.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b22q">Reading John with St. Thomas Aquinas</a><br>
  Author(s) Ashley Benedict M.<br>
  Abstract: The First and Second Parts of the 
                  Summa theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas prepare for his exploration of the mystery of the Person and work of Jesus Christ our Savior. His treatment of the Church, the sacraments, and the goal of history are all considered as the completion of his own work during his earthly and risen life. In his exploration in the Third Part of his Summa theologiae of the Person and work of Jesus, St. Thomas Aquinas drew heavily on his previous study of the fourth Gospel.¹ In the Prologue of his commentary on this Gospel (n. 1)<br>

  6  Bias from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b414">The Quest for God and the Good Life</a><br>
  Abstract: Sin and evil are categories traditional to Catholic theology, even if Lonergan’s analysis of them is his own. Bias, an inauthentic orientation caused by and causal of inauthentic actions, decisions, judgments, ideas, and experiences, is a concept more original to Lonergan. It is both the result of sin and a cause of further sin.¹ As such, bias functions in a way I find similar to Aristotle’s bad habits, or vices.² However, while Aristotle discusses vice as an extreme on either side of a golden mean, Lonergan analyzes bias in terms of conscious intentionality, social dynamics, and history.

  Religious Authority and the Challenges of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32b68d">Tradition and Modernity</a><br>
  Author(s) JENKINS PHILIP<br>
  Abstract: Societies live by their myths. If asked about the modern history of religious authority, many Americans at least would turn to the legendary 1925 Scopes trial, the bitter confrontation between supporters and critics of Darwinian evolution, as mediated through the film 
                  Inherit the Wind (1960). Here, we think, reason and science ran rings around obscurantism and faith, and that victory marked the end of the Bible’s credibility as an infallible source of divine wisdom. While obviously this did not mark the end of religion, it set strict limits to the scope of religion’s claims, particularly in the public sphere. Religion,<br>

  Author(s) HART DAVID BENTLEY<br>
  Abstract: Modernity—to the degree that it was or is a kind of cultural project or epochal ideology—understands itself as the history of freedom. Or rather, I suppose I should say, the one grand cultural and historical narrative that we as modern persons tend to share, and that most sharply distinguishes a modern from a premodern vision of society, is the story of liberation, the story of the ascent of the individual out of the shadows of hierarchy and subsidiary identity into the light of full recognition, dignity, and autonomy.

  Abstract: The following essay is directed towards a solution of the difficulty which has been stated,—the difficulty, as far as it exists, which lies in the way of our using in controversy the testimony of our most natural informant concerning the doctrine and worship of Christianity, viz. the history of eighteen hundred years.

  Abstract: The christian mission is the clue to world history, not in the sense that it is the “winning side” in the battle with the other forces of human history, but in the sense that it is the point at which the meaning of history is understood and at which men are required to make the final decisions about that meaning. It is, so to say, not the motor but the blade, not the driving force but the cutting edge. Christians do not go through the battles of history as the master race.

  Author(s) WALHOF DARREN R.<br>
  Abstract: Writing in the wake of the furor over her account of the Eichmann trial, Hannah Arendt reflects on why truth and politics are, in her words, “on rather bad terms.”¹ Her analysis rests on dividing truth into two different types. The first type, rational truth, is the subject of mathematics and philosophy. It has a long history of tension with politics, going back at least to Plato, who worried about the displacement of rational truth by mere opinion. In the modern age, Arendt says, opinion has generally won the day, rendering rational truth politically irrelevant.² The second type, factual truth,<br>

  CHAPTER 3  TEMPORAL MOSAICS: from:

  Abstract: This chapter will examine two works by the Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga, 
                  Obabakoak (1988) and El hombre solo (1995), in order to assess their treatment of contemporary Spanish experiences of history and temporality and the subsequent effects on community identity. The previous chapter probed these issues in Llamazares’s work in the context of modernity. My aim here is to intensify the problematization of community in modernity presented in the first chapter through an analysis of Atxaga’s focus on identity in the more recent contexts of post-Francoist Spain. Underlying the key issues which arise in this chapter, therefore, is the postmodern<br>

  Abstract: What is a consequent marxist view of the history and philosophy of science? Reference to Marx’s and Engels’s (or even Lenin’s) work will not yield a satisfactory answer, although certain signposts are evident. For example, there is the famous observation on method in the introduction to the

  Book Title: Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): WEINSHEIMER JOEL<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging historical introduction to philosophical hermeneutics, Jean Grondin discusses the major figures from Philo to Habermas, analyzes conflicts between various interpretive schools, and provides a persuasive critique of Gadamer's view of hermeneutic history, though in other ways Gadamer's
      Truth and Methodserves as a model for Grondin's approach.Grondin begins with brief overviews of the pre-nineteenth-century thinkers Philo, Origen, Augustine, Luther, Flacius, Dannhauer, Chladenius, Meier, Rambach, Ast, and Schlegel. Next he provides more extensive treatments of such major nineteenth-century figures as Schleiermacher, Böckh, Droysen, and Dilthey. There are full chapters devoted to Heidegger and Gadamer as well as shorter discussions of Betti, Habermas, and Derrida. Because he is the first to pay close attention to pre-Romantic figures, Grondin is able to show that the history of hermeneutics cannot be viewed as a gradual, steady progression in the direction of complete universalization. His book makes it clear that even in the early period, hermeneutic thinkers acknowledged a universal aspect in interpretation-that long before Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was philosophical and not merely practical. In revising and correcting the standard account, Grondin's book is not merely introductory but revisionary, suitable for beginners as well as advanced students in the field.<br>

  Foreword from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Author(s) Gadamer Hans-Georg<br>
  Abstract: The “universality of hermeneutics” is less the name of a certain position than a demand for a certain kind of distinction. The term
                  hermeneuticsgoes far back and traverses a long history from which there is still much to learn today. However, the termuniversalitypresents a challenge, as it were—one that indicates not so much a philosophical position as a philosophical task. Thus I am very happy to be able to introduce Jean Grondin’s book, already known to me in German, to the English reader. At the outset of the long history of the concept of hermeneutics stands<br>

  II  Hermeneutics between Grammar and Critique from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In the introduction I noted that there is good reason not to chart hermeneutic history in a ideological manner. We might better maintain a healthy skepticism toward the widespread idea that hermeneutics came into its own by advancing from a loose collection of interpretive rules to the status of a universal problematic. In reviewing the course of its “prehistory”—called this only because the word
                  hermeneuticswas not yet in use—we have seen that such a teleological view is not borne out. At the same time, the various stages of what came to be called hermeneutics (that is, theory<br>

  VI  Gadamer and the Universe of Hermeneutics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In making language the essence of hermeneutics Gadamer clearly follows the later Heidegger’s radicalization of historical thrownness. His aim, however, is to reconcile this radicalization with the young Heidegger’s hermeneutical starting point, namely, understanding. Specifically, given that we are situated in a history articulated in linguistic tradition, what are the consequences for human understanding and self-knowledge? These consequences are elaborated in “The Ontological Shift of Hermeneutics Guided by Language,” the title of the last third of Gadamer’s magnum opus,
                  Truth and Method. To understand what this ontological or universal shift in hermeneutics implies, we need to return to the underlying<br>

  Book Title: Pushkin's Historical Imagination-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Evdokimova Svetlana<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the historical insights of Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837), Russia's most celebrated poet and arguably its greatest thinker. Svetlana Evdokimova examines for the first time the full range of Pushkin's fictional and nonfictional writings on the subject of history-writings that have strongly influenced Russians' views of themselves and their past. Through new readings of his drama,
      Boris Godunov; such narrative poems asPoltava, The Bronze Horseman,andCount Nulin; prose fiction, includingThe Captain's DaughterandBlackamoor of Peter the Great; lyrical poems; and a variety of nonfictional texts, the author presents Pushkin not only as a progenitor of Russian national mythology but also as an original historical and political thinker.Evdokimova considers Pushkin within the context of Romantic historiography and addresses the tension between Pushkin the historian and Pushkin the fiction writer . She also discusses Pushkin's ideas on the complex relations between chance and necessity in historical processes, on the particular significance of great individuals in Russian history, and on historical truth.<br>

  Abstract: The analysis of the relationship between history and fiction—a problem that has stimulated European thought since the time of Aristotle, was developed by Vico, and then elaborated in structural and post-structural theory—has special relevance in the Russian context in general and for the study of Pushkin in particular. The beginning of the nineteenth century was a turning point in the development of both Russian literary and historical imagination. This was the time of artistic experimentation, when old genres were rethought and new ones proliferated. The Romanticist interest in history generated an intense growth in historical fiction and history<br>

                  everything” (44). Indeed, the whole pleiad of Russian intellectuals in the first half of the nineteenth century exhibited a near obsession with history.

  Abstract: The term
                  confessionis defined as “the disclosing of something the knowledge of which by others is considered humiliating or prejudicial to the person confessing: a making known or acknowledging of one’s fault, wrong, crime, weakness, etc.” Although this definition encompasses matters of special importance in the traditions of both law and religion, it is the religious association that is relevant to the history of psychological healing. In that tradition, it has been considered “a religious act: the acknowledging of sin or sinfulness.” More specifically, it became “auricular confession”: that is, “addressed to the ear; told privately in the ear.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Persuasion is another element in psychological healing that has a long and significant history. With the emergence of the “persuasionists” as significant among the psychotherapeutists of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it has seemed to some that persuasion was primarily a mode of psychological treatment that had arisen as a challenge to the “suggestionists” of the day. But persuasion as a method long antedated the mesmerists, the hypnotists, and those who practiced suggestive therapeutics. Like suggestion, persuasion was far from a latter-day addition to psychological healing.<br>

  Book Title: Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry-New Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLMSTED WENDY<br>
  Abstract: This exceptional collection of writings offers for the first time a discussion among leading thinkers about the points at which rhetoric and religion illuminate and challenge each other. The contributors to the volume are eminent theorists and critics in rhetoric, theology, and religion, and they address a variety of problems and periods.Together these writings shed light on religion as a human quest and rhetoric as the origin and sustainer of that quest. They show that when pursued with intelligence and sensitivity, rhetorical approaches to religion are capable of revitalizing both language and experience. Rhetorical figures, for example, constitute forms of language that say what cannot be said in any other way, and that move individuals toward religious truths that cannot be known in any other way. When firmly placed within religious, social, and literary history, the convergence of rhetoric and religion brings into focus crucial issues in several fields-including philosophy, psychology, history, and art-and interprets relations among self, language, and world that are central to both past and present cultures.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bqqd">Rhetorical Invention and Religious Inquiry</a><br>
  Author(s) ONG WALTER J .<br>
  Abstract: The history of what was originally the spoken word cannot be considered merely as a chain of events, a series of phenomena strung out in a neutral field of time, but rather must be taken as a succession of difficult, and often traumatic, reorientations of the human psyche. As the word moves from sound into space (without ever fully departing from sound) and then restructures itself electronically into sound in a new way, the sensorium is reorganized, and man’s relationship to the physical world around him, to his fellow men, to his own thought, and to himself radically changes.<br>

  Author(s) SHUGER DEBORA K.<br>
  Abstract: In a 1990 essay, Stanley Fish suggested that the history of Western thought from Plato through postmodernism could best be understood as a protracted debate between those who seek the truth and the sophists, or as what he terms the “quarrel between philosophy and rhetoric” (“Rhetoric,” 206, 209).¹ According to Fish, rhetoric is thus sophistic discourse, at once partisan and playful, and hence doubly “unconstrained by any sense of responsibility either to the Truth or to the Good”; it appeals to the emotions rather than the intellect and strives for victory rather than understanding. Philosophy, conversely, pursues “what is absolutely<br>

  Abstract: Since 1980 both Jewish and non-Jewish scholars have made important contributions to the understanding of antisemitism, dubbed by Robert Wistrich “the longest hatred.”¹ But little attention has been given to antisemitism’s opposite, philosemitism.² That lacuna exists even though it has been increasingly recognized that Jewish history is not a story of unremitting worldwide persecution. Allowing for rough patches, America in particular has been hospitable to Jews. Even
                     Antisemitism in America,a scholarly history of that unhappy topic, concludes with chapters on the second half of the twentieth century entitled “The Tide Ebbs” and “At Home in America.”³<br>

  Book Title: Faces of History-Historical Inquiry from Herodotus to Herder<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

  Abstract: “History,” Michel de Certeau writes, “is probably our myth.”¹ According to an old and familiar story, history emerged from myth and purged itself gradually of legendary features until it gained full enlightenment in the age of Machiavelli and Guicciardini—or perhaps Voltaire and Gibbon, or perhaps Mommsen and Ranke, or perhaps the “new” economic, social, and cultural histories of this century, and so on. Or maybe, as Certeau suggests and Hans Blumenberg argues, not. “Sceptical doubt... is a malady which can never be radically cured,” David Hume remarked, and the same can be said (with or without the pathological conceit)<br>

  3  Roman Foundations from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Roman historical writing developed out of a deep and to some extent parochial sense of tradition and location.¹ The Romans measured time “from the founding of the city” (
                  ab urbe condita,the title of Livy’s national history), and for them space was centered likewise on the city, with its sacred boundary, thepomaeriumestablished by Numa Pompilius, defining the city and marking a frontier defended by the god Terminus, which would be extended eventually to much of the known world.² In such terms Roman history was conceived and interpreted by historians and poets and by ordinary citizens, the “fathers” honoring<br>

  4  The Education of the Human Race from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: In his enduringly influential conception of human history, St. Augustine of Hippo combined classical culture with the new dispensation fashioned by Christianity out of its transmutation, or subversion, of Judaism, and he represented this new doctrine as the result of a Platonic enlightenment. History was indeed the “mistress of life”
                  (magistra vitae),as Cicero had taught, but in a very special sense: “The education of the human race, represented by the people of God, has advanced, like that of an individual, through certain epochs, or, as it were, ages, so that it might gradually rise from earthly to heavenly things,<br>

  5  History in the Medieval Mirror from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: In the mid-thirteenth century the Dominican scholar Vincent of Beauvais produced an enormous encyclopedia, a
                  Speculum universale(Universal mirror), of which the last part, compiled mainly by associates, was a “Historical Mirror”(Speculum historiale).¹ This historical summa, which combined both old and new—“old as to subject and authority, new as to compilation and arrangement”—represented the state of scholarship in the age of Thomas Aquinas. It is arranged “following not only the succession of holy scriptures but also the order of secular history”(secularium hystoriarum ordinem)and, invoking the formulas of Cicero and Quintilian, promises the usual benefits of<br>

  7  Reformation Traditions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: “Upon thorough reflection,” declared Martin Luther in 1538, “one finds that almost all laws, art, good counsel, warning, threatening, terrifying, comforting, strengthening, instruction, prudence, wisdom, discretion, and all virtues well up out of the narratives and histories as from a living fountain.”¹ This would seem to be little more than a curiously enthusiastic variation on the humanist praises repeated so often in the genre of the
                  ars historica,as in Pierre Droit de Gaillard’s declaration that “all disciplines take their sources and the basis of their principles from history, as from an overflowing fountain.”² The difference was Luther’s pious addition,<br>

  8  The Science of History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: Renaissance humanism is defined in large part in terms of its idealization of classical culture and its attempts, implicitly dependent on historical understanding, to imitate the ancient Romans and Greeks in moral, social, and political as well as literary terms.¹ Humanism is defined, too, by its particular attachment to the humanities
                  (studia humanitatis),which meant the first two members of the medieval trivium—grammar and rhetoric—together with moral philosophy, poetry, and history. History was central to the humanist agenda not only as an “art” in its own right but also because of its ties with the other humanities. That<br>

  9  Philosophical History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: The Enlightenment conception of history, in its classic form, is based on one of the oldest historical conceits. Humanity is like individual members of the species, and the experience of the human race over time is much like the life of a person, from generation and growth to, presumably if not predictably, corruption and death, whence history, for Ferguson, Lessing, and Condorcet no less than for Florus and Augustine, can be understood as “the education of the human race.” Education, or the neologism “culture” (which referred to the same thing in the eighteenth century), was of course seen differently by<br>

  10  Modern Historiography from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: By the end of the eighteenth century, the study of history had achieved the status not only of a literary genre, discipline, and “science,” with its own complex history, but also of a profession. There were established chairs of history in the universities of Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany, as well as official historiographers, official collections of documents, and other kinds of private and public support for practitioners of history.¹ What was new in the Enlightenment was the encounters between history and philosophy, which had likewise, and even earlier, emerged as a professional field with an academic base.<br>

  Epilogue from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bs9h">Faces of History</a><br>
  Abstract: This book ends where most accounts of the modern study of history begin—that is, with the rise of historicism, the academic and professional organization of history, and the classics of nineteenth-century historical narrative. Even for Lord Acton, who was well aware of the “brave men who lived before Agamemnon,” the postrevolutionary period began a new era, an era that was more significant than the revival of learning in the Renaissance. Yet the three marks of novelty for Acton—exploitation of archives, application of historical criticism, and attainment of impartiality—were all claims which historians had made across many centuries.<br>

  Book Title: Metaphysics in Ordinary Language-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosen Stanley<br>
  Abstract: In this rich collection of philosophical writings, Stanley Rosen addresses a wide range of topics-from eros, poetry, and freedom to problems like negation and the epistemological status of sense perception. Though diverse in subject, Rosen's essays share two unifying principles: there can be no legitimate separation of textual hermeneutics from philosophical analysis, and philosophical investigation must be oriented in terms of everyday language and experience, although it cannot simply remain within these confines. Ordinary experience provides a minimal criterion for the assessment of extraordinary discourses, Rosen argues, and without such a criterion we would have no basis for evaluating conflicting discourses: philosophy would give way to poetry.Philosophical problems are not so deeply embedded in a specific historical context that they cannot be restated in terms as valid for us today as they were for those who formulated them, the author maintains. Rosen shows that the history of philosophy-a story of conflicting interpretations of human life and the structure of intelligibility-is a story that comes to life only when it is rethought in terms of the philosophical problems of our own personal and historical situation.<br>

  Abstract: Hans W. Frei’s projected history of Christology in the modern period was cut short by his death on 12 September 1988. It was to be a major project for which he had been preparing through most of his academic career, and those who knew him and his scholarship looked forward to it with high anticipation.

  9  Sensus Communis: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32btm9">On the Nature of Consciousness</a><br>
  Abstract: The major alternative to a computational theory of mind has always been the view that self-referential consciousness emerges out of the dynamic synthesis of the senses. We can trace this alternative history of mind from Aristotle’s 
                  coeno-aesthesis, as common ground of the senses and source of imagination, to the Roman sensus communis, closer to our common sense, to Romantic accounts of imagination, aesthetics, and ethical “truths of the heart,” and even to Freud’s system unconscious. It disappears and reappears periodically, based always on the placing together of the unity of the senses, self-consciousness, intuition, empathy, and creative imagination — in<br>

  1  What Is Psychoanalysis? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: A first step in studying whether psychoanalysis is effective is to delimit the treatments that will be called psychoanalysis. Freud (1904) defined psychoanalysis as the 
                  interrelated methods of observation, a conceptual system, and a therapeutic procedure. But the details of this interrelation are unclear. What boundaries of technique and theory usefully set off psychoanalytic ideas and processes from other activities? How are various ways of thinking about psychoanalysis interrelated? The question of what activities and theory are legitimately called psychoanalytic pervades the history of the field, often resulting in discord (see, e.g., Freud, 1914b, 1924; Oberndorf, 1953; Roustang, 1976; Turkle,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bvwm">Does Psychoanalysis Work?</a><br>
  Abstract: Increasingly sophisticated research methods promise results from systematic investigations that are more psychoanalytically significant than those of past investigations. However, systematic investigation in psychoanalysis is unfortunately associated in many analysts’ minds, and also in the minds of many friends and foes of psychoanalysis, with a long history of fault finding. This attitude is epitomized in the criticisms of Eysenck (1952, 1966), Hook (1959), Grünbaum (1984, 1994), and Crews and colleagues (1995). Each of these authors asserts a rigidly positivistic view of science and shows that psychoanalysis<br>

  Book Title: The Hebrew Bible and Philosophy of Religion-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Gericke Jaco<br>
  Abstract: This study pioneers the use of philosophy of religion in the study of the Hebrew Bible. After identifying the need for a legitimate philosophical approach to Israelite religion, the volume traces the history of interdisciplinary relations and shows how descriptive varieties of philosophy of religion can aid the clarification of the Hebrew Bible’s own metaphysical, epistemological, and moral assumptions. Two new interpretative methodologies are developed and subsequently applied through an introduction to what the biblical texts took for granted about the nature of religious language, the concept of deity, the properties of Yhwh, the existence of gods, religious epistemology, and the relation between religion and morality.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzm3">The Hebrew Bible and Philosophy of Religion</a><br>
  Abstract: Interdisciplinary research in the study of the Hebrew Bible is nothing novel.² In fact, it is impossible to do any other kind. All forms of biblical criticism have recourse to at least one auxiliary subject, be it linguistics, literary criticism, history, archaeology, anthropology, sociology, psychology, theology, philosophy, or another. In a pluralist hermeneutical context where different methodologies offer different insights, none of these auxiliary fields can lay claim to be

  Abstract: The purpose of this chapter is to provide a brief and broad social history of Ptolemaic Judah, which will include a class analysis of the society. This necessitates analyzing the Ptolemaic political and economic system into which Judah was integrated. It is important to emphasize that primary sources are few for the period, both for Ptolemaic Egypt and Judah. Therefore, I draw on secondary sources by experts to synthesize the material and make it meaningful. Priority is given to experts on the Ptolemaic kingdom and not just Qohelet specialists. These procedures help mitigate the typical circularity that biblical scholars fall<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bzwz">The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes</a><br>
  Abstract: Now that the social history of the period and class analysis of Judean society have been delineated, it is appropriate to show where Qohelet possibly alludes to this history and then where he and his audience should be located socially. With the former, there is a significant caveat. Qohelet is part of a mode of literature called wisdom literature. By its very nature, wisdom literature is resistant to such investigation.¹ That is because it is focused not on recording and interpreting events in the past but rather on the cognitive and moral development of its audience. It may refer to<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32c046">The Future of the Biblical Past</a><br>
  Author(s) Wimbush Vincent L.<br>
  Abstract: This essay makes the case for a new critical orientation that has as its focus not historical criticism and its ever increasing razzle-dazzle offshoots, but a critical history (Nora 1994, 300) involving engagement and fathoming of forms of representations and expressivity (including artifacts), modes of performativity, structures of social-cultural-psychological dynamics and power relations—in effect, the phenomenon most often referred to with the English shorthand “Scriptures.” In this essay about the future of a discourse about Scriptures that has been complexly oriented to the study of the past, I arrogate to myself the right and privilege to think with that<br>

  Abstract: Nothing presents more problems for those who would enter the mentality of the medieval philosophical theologian than the task which has been set for this volume. Trying to judge the influence on Thomas Aquinas’s doctrine of one of his authoritative ancient sources requires us to surrender, at least provisionally, what we think we know about the authority in question. As heirs of Renaissance and modern philology, and of the modern constructions of the history of philosophy, we will almost certainly have a different, perhaps even opposed, view of the source than a medieval theologian would have had. Ironically, our problem<br>

  Abstract: In the first place, we noticed a gap in international historiography. Although many studies have been published in various countries on the fate of the Jewish communities in one Islamic context or another, far fewer attempts have been made to provide a comprehensive view of the history of the Jews in the Islamic world.

  Author(s) Rustow Marina<br>
  Abstract: The Islamic world housed the majority of the world’s Jews for most of the medieval period, and the Jewish communities of the Islamic world were responsible for many of the institutions, texts, and practices that would define Judaism well into the modern era. Islamic rule remade the very conditions—intellectual, demographic, economic—in which Jewish communities lived, and created a civilization that enabled them to thrive. But just as much of medieval Jewish history is about Jews under Islamic rule, so, too, is much of the history of the early Islamic world about non-Muslims.<br>

The late medieval and premodern period of this sojourn, dating approximately between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, occurred during formative centuries in Iranian history, characterized primarily by the struggle to define and consolidate the borders and character of the future state of Iran.

  Abstract: In the late nineteenth century, the fate of the Jews of Algeria, inscribed within the vast history of Mediterranean Judaism, hinged on the relations between Jews and Muslims during the colonial period of the Maghreb, a situation that had consequences in the following century. When the first French soldiers landed in the bay of Sidi Ferruch, the Jews of Algeria constituted an organized “nation,” or
                  millet, of the Ottoman administration. In 1830 the Jewish community of Algeria was 25,000 strong, and most of its members were poor. The reactions of the Jews to colonial development varied a great deal by<br>

  Abstract: Nazi anti-Semitism is alien to Muslim cultures. That said, it would be an offense to history to overlook the fact that during World War II a number of authorities in Islamic territories hoped for the victory of the Axis powers. Apart from a few isolated cases we will discuss, these positions were not reached out of ideological sympathy with Nazism, the substance of which was generally unknown to the population. Rather, these authorities hoped that the defeat of France and England at the hands of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy would precipitate the end of Western colonialism, which the two<br>

By the 2000s, the figure had fallen to 17,000. That demographic decline, which even now continues at a slower pace, stands in contrast to the rather prosperous situation of the Jewish population, whose institutions have experienced a clear revival since the late 1990s. That paradox is an expression of the complex relations between the Turkish nation and its Jewish community, and it demonstrates equally complex connections between history and memory.

  Abstract: In French-language Maghrebi literature, the relationship between Jews and Muslims is a question of particular resonance, in that the colonial past weighs heavily on contemporary history. Both Jewish and Muslim writers have achieved fame in the field, weaving, in the same language, connections based on places that, despite antagonisms, have sometimes shaped shared spaces. Since the conflictual alterity of the 1950s, that literature has evolved toward new dialogical expressions imposed by the rise of the different fundamentalisms, by way of the trials of nationalism in the 1960s and the international issues associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

  Author(s) Freudenthal Gad<br>
  Abstract: Science and philosophy did not develop spontaneously within Judaism. The intellectual activities of traditional Jewish cultures generally focused on the canonical texts of the tradition: the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud. Any other type of knowledge, that is, any knowledge not vested with the authority of the canonical texts and of revelation, was considered “foreign.” This point, fundamental for understanding Jewish intellectual history, was forcefully stated in 1933 by the great historian Julius Guttmann: “The history of Jewish philosophy is a history of the successive absorption of foreign ideas.”¹<br>

  Abstract: Over the some twelve centuries that the Jews and the Muslims lived together in the Mediterranean world and the Near East, relations between the two communities were nowhere so dense and reciprocal as in the leisurely routines of everyday life. This rich relationship between two religious communities with a turbulent history has not been documented as meticulously as their hostile relations and their segregation. The colonial period in the Maghreb, which lasted until the 1950s, was emblematic of these everyday exchanges.

  Abstract: It is often claimed today that comparative literature is a kind of translation and, being a practice less transparent than translation, should take translation as its model. This claim feels avant-garde: it resonates with the “linguistic turn” that informed most of the humanistic disciplines during the last quarter of the last century and vividly survives today in neighboring disciplines, like English, foreign languages, history, and anthropology, with their concerns for globalization, the media, and the mentalities of postcolonialism. But whether the translation model for comparative literature is to be a step forward, a step back, or the source of a<br>

  Abstract: The question of metrical translation—its history, theory, and practice—is not often posed in current translation studies, except perhaps by translators who confront “a choice between rhyme and reason,” as Nabokov asked himself in translating Pushkin: “Can a translation while rendering with absolute fidelity the whole text, and nothing but the text, keep the form of the original, its rhythm and its rhyme?”¹ Like swearing an oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth before going on trial, the translator who vows to be true to “the whole text, and nothing but the text” must be<br>

  Author(s) BERMANN SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: René Char’s “Feuillets d’Hypnos” brings before us the lived history of the French resistance, joining traumatic memory with hopes for a future of freedom and human dialogue. Closely intertwined with Char’s own actions as captain on the maquis, the collection of prose poems offers a rare engagement with historical experience in poetic form, both a tragic affirmation of life and, in its own right, a means of resistance. But I also argue here that this example of historical poetry illustrates some important connections between the writing of lived historical event and translation. Both are linguistic acts dedicated to the “survival”<br>

  Abstract: Given this complex genealogy of the idea of “experience,” there are several ways in which we could proceed. We could try to ignore or deny its history and use the word in the most minimal and seemingly innocuous way possible—equating experience with simply being alive or sensately aware, for example. Or we could suggest that, because philosophers have gotten it wrong, we should try to wipe the slate clean and redefine experience in a less culture-laden, less bourgeois, or perhaps less masculine way. We could argue that the Western heritage presents only one, albeit variegated, strand of experience, with<br>

  Framing the Homeless from:

  Abstract: Basic to the sublime disorders of the post-industrial age, then, is a common sentiment: whether it be the occasional thrill of semantic collapse or a yearning for structural decay, there is a delight in the fall. The architects of Boston’s homeless—politicians, journalists, consumers, psychiatrists, ethnographers, and the dislocated themselves—are tempted by a similar aesthetics of decay when invoking or depicting these people. As I understand it, confrontations with Boston’s itinerant often evoke sentiments similar to those conjured by Rudolph’s ruin. This is not to say that the cultural history of the homeless is identical to that of the<br>

  Abstract: “Space is for us an existential and cultural dominant.” So concludes Fredric Jameson, having described postmodernism’s dependence on a “supplement of spatiality” that results from its depletion of history and consequent exaggeration of the present (365). Indeed, recent years have seen an increasing interest in the politics of place, the cultural function of geography, and the reassertion of the importance of space in any cultural study. The territory of these arguments is marked out in diverse areas in the work of people like Michel Foucault, Gaston Bachelard, David Harvey, Edward Soja, Doreen Massey, Fredric Jameson, Pierre Bourdieu, and Michel de<br>

  Book Title: Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna (Ibn Sina)-With a Translation of the Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Heath Peter<br>
  Abstract: Islamic allegory is the product of a cohesive literary tradition to which few contributed as significantly as Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the eleventh-century Muslim philosopher. Peter Heath here offers a detailed examination of Avicenna's contribution, paying special attention to Avicenna's psychology and poetics and to the ways in which they influenced strains of theological, mystical, and literary thought in subsequent Islamic-and Western-intellectual and religious history. Heath begins by showing how Avicenna's writings fit into the context and general history of Islamic allegory and explores the interaction among allegory, allegoresis, and philosophy in Avicenna's thought. He then provides a brief introduction to Avicenna as an historical figure. From there, he examines the ways in which Avicenna's cosmological, psychological, and epistemological theories find parallel, if diverse, expression in the disparate formats of philosophical and allegorical narration. Included in this book is an illustration of Avicenna's allegorical practice. This takes the form of a translation of the Mi'raj Nama (The Book of the Prophet Muhammad's Ascent to Heaven), a short treatise in Persian generally attributed to Avicenna. The text concludes with an investigation of the literary dimension Avicenna's allegorical theory and practice by examining his use of description metaphor. Allegory and Philosophy in Avicenna is an original and important work that breaks new ground by applying the techniques of modern literary criticism to the study of Medieval Islamic philosophy. It will be of interest to scholars and students of medieval Islamic and Western literature and philosophy.<br>

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

In exploring the new image of science that has been developing in the postempiricist philosophy and history of science, we have witnessed the recovery of the hermeneutical dimension of science in both the natural and the social sciences. In the philosophy of the natural sciences, this development has been characterized as having begun with an obsession with the meaning and reference of single terms (logically proper names and ostensive definition), moved to the search for a rigorous criterion for discriminating<br>

  Book Title: Sensuous Scholarship-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): STOLLER PAUL<br>
  Abstract: Among the Songhay of Mali and Niger, who consider the stomach the seat of personality, learning is understood not in terms of mental activity but in bodily terms. Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In
      Sensuous ScholarshipPaul Stoller challenges contemporary social theorists and cultural critics who-using the notion of embodiment to critique Eurocentric and phallocentric predispositions in scholarly thought-consider the body primarily as a text that can be read and analyzed. Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Abstract: It’s customary to credit Poe with elaborating all the conventions of detective fiction that subsequent practitioners of the genre have followed to a greater or lesser degree.¹ Yet Poe’s privileged role as founder or father of a literary genre—a role perhaps unique in literary history—has obscured the fact that he marks what can now be recognized as a first phase of the genre’s development. Key works of detective fiction in the twentieth century, especially in its latter half, represent a distinct departure from Poe’s “tales of ratiocination” and, indeed, from traditional hermeneutics.² Before we can delineate this later<br>

  Book Title: Performing the Past-Memory, History, and Identity in Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Winter Jay<br>
  Abstract: Special EURO 10,- discount for our ABG readers: now EURO 24,50 instead of EURO 34,50Performing the Past is an investigation of the multiple social and culture practices through which Europeans have negotiated the space between their history and their memory over the past 200 years. In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed. Producing and selling them is big business; if the past is indeed a foreign country, there are tens of thousands of tourist agents, guides, and pundits around to help us on our way, for a fee, to be sure.This collection of essays by renowned scholars from, among others, Yale, Columbia, Amsterdam Oxford, Cambridge, New York University and the European University Institute in Florence, is essential reading for anyone interested in today's memory boom. Drawing on different national and disciplinary traditions, the authors ultimately engage us with the ways in which Europeans continue a venerable tradition of finding out who they are, and where they are going, by performing the past.<br>

At one extreme, we find historical plays from Shakespeare to Strindberg and beyond or the historical operas of Verdi, say, or Glinka; in other words, performances that are tightly organized, fully scripted, and carefully rehearsed. At the other extreme, there are loosely organized, unscripted, and unrehearsed attempts to re-enact past events in<br>

  Book Title: Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Góis Pedro<br>
  Abstract: Globalisation, migration and integration have shaken up identity processes and identity dynamics as never before. But in a post-colonial, multi-ethnic Europe, what is identity? How is it constructed? Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe endeavours to answer these questions and more. Eleven of the thirteen chapters present empirical case studies from the Basque Country, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Portugal - thus resulting in one of the first international volumes to highlight Portugal's diverse and complex migration flows. Transnationalism also takes centre stage in several contributions that survey various types of informal and formal networks in local communities and across national borders. Via American studies, anthropology, cultural studies, ethnology, history, social psychology and sociology, the authors come from an array of disciplines as dynamic as the continent about which they write.

The second position, although related to the first, recognises that as well as the many points of similarity there are also critical points of significant difference which constitute what we really are, or rather, what<br>

  Abstract: In the late 1970s, a new generation of film scholars set themselves the task of re-examining from top to bottom the period of cinema’s emergence. This did not fail to provoke major upheavals within the – quite young – discipline of “cinema studies,” which had only recently been admitted to university and was still far from having acquired complete legitimacy. What is more, the forceful arrival of this enquiry into the “source” most certainly contributed to the remarkable reversal witnessed within the discipline in the 1980s, when questions of film

  Book Title: The Making of the Humanities-Volume 1- Early Modern Europe<br>
  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Weststeijn Thijs<br>
  Abstract: This book is the first step towards the development of a comparative history of the humanities. Specialists in philology, musicology, art history, linguistics, literary theory, and other disciplines highlight the intertwining of the various fields and their impact on the sciences. This first volume in the series The Making of the Humanities focuses on the early modern period. Different perspectives reveal how the humanities developed from the 'liberal arts', via the curriculum of humanistic schools, to modern disciplines. The authors show in particular how discoveries in the humanities contributed to a secular world view, pointing up connections with the scientific revolution. The main themes are: the humanities versus the sciences; the visual arts as liberal arts; humanism and heresy; language and poetics; linguists and logicians; philology and philosophy; the history of history. Contributions come from a selection of internationally renowned European and American scholars, including Floris Cohen, David Cram, and Ingrid Rowland. The book offers a wealth of insights for specialists, students, and those interested in the humanities in a broad sense. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  Abstract: The history of the humanities, or

Therefore, one may fruitfully look for models or examples in the history of the natural sciences in order to avoid reinventing the wheel, or running into difficulties that have already been encountered elsewhere, and perhaps even solved. There are also more principled reasons, however, for thematizing the rise of a strict disciplinary opposition between the humanities and the natural sciences, an opposition which is more recent and less stable than one might think.

  Abstract: This paper explores some of the developments in grammar, logic and rhetoric that took place in Europe in the seventeenth century. These disciplines were traditionally seen as belonging together, as they each dealt with language in a particular way. For this reason, they were called the ‘artes sermocinales’, or arts of discourse. The seventeenth century was a period of radical changes in intellectual history at large, and this paper investigates how the arts of discourse were affected by these changes. In particular, it was a period in which the prestige of the arts of discourse declined, and in which some<br>

Although the dialogue between contemporary scholars and their predecessors might extend into a somewhat further past than in the natural and social sciences, the various fields of the humanities tend to reflect just as little on their own history as, for instance, chemistry or psychology.

  Book Title: Poetry as Survival-  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ORR GREGORY<br>
  Abstract: Intended for general readers and for students and scholars of poetry, Poetry as Survival is a complex and lucid analysis of the powerful role poetry can play in confronting, surviving, and transcending pain and suffering. Gregory Orr draws from a generous array of sources. He weaves discussions of work by Keats, Dickinson, and Whitman with quotes from three-thousand-year-old Egyptian poems, Inuit songs, and Japanese love poems to show that writing personal lyric has helped poets throughout history to process emotional and experiential turmoil, from individual stress to collective grief. More specifically, he considers how the acts of writing, reading, and listening to lyric bring ordering powers to the chaos that surrounds us. Moving into more contemporary work, Orr looks at the poetry of Sylvia Plath, Stanley Kunitz, and Theodore Roethke, poets who relied on their own work to get through painful psychological experiences. As a poet who has experienced considerable trauma--especially as a child--Orr refers to the damaging experiences of his past and to the role poetry played in his ability to recover and survive. His personal narrative makes all the more poignant and vivid Orr's claims for lyric poetry's power as a tool for healing. Poetry as Survival is a memorable and inspiring introduction to lyric poetry's capacity to help us find safety and comfort in a threatening world.<br>

  Privilege’s Mausoleum: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46nj70">Southern Masculinity</a><br>
  Author(s) Breu Christopher<br>
  Abstract: One of the challenges to theorizing masculinity in relationship to history is the way in which historical narratives are often implicitly gendered as masculine. Typically, this gendering takes the form of allegory, in which the imagined subject of a period is presented as implicitly or, less often, explicitly male.¹ Such a subject, then, becomes the bearer of temporality in the narrative constructed by the historical text. The modern male subject, for example, becomes imagined as exemplary of the universal modern experience. In such a context, temporality and narrative history become gendered, and it becomes a challenge to imagine other forms<br>

  Book Title: The Bioregional Imagination-Literature, Ecology, and Place<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLER EZRA<br>
  Abstract: Bioregionalism is an innovative way of thinking about place and planet from an ecological perspective. Although bioregional ideas occur regularly in ecocritical writing, until now no systematic effort has been made to outline the principles of bioregional literary criticism and to use it as a way to read, write, understand, and teach literature. The twenty-four original essays here are written by an outstanding selection of international scholars. The range of bioregions covered is global and includes such diverse places as British Columbia's Meldrum Creek and Italy's Po River Valley, the Arctic and the Outback. There are even forays into cyberspace and outer space. In their comprehensive introduction, the editors map the terrain of the bioregional movement, including its history and potential to inspire and invigorate place-based and environmental literary criticism. Responding to bioregional tenets, this volume is divided into four sections. The essays in the "Reinhabiting" section narrate experiments in living-in-place and restoring damaged environments. The "Rereading" essays practice bioregional literary criticism, both by examining texts with strong ties to bioregional paradigms and by opening other, less-obvious texts to bioregional analysis. In "Reimagining," the essays push bioregionalism to evolve-by expanding its corpus of texts, coupling its perspectives with other approaches, or challenging its core constructs. Essays in the "Renewal" section address bioregional pedagogy, beginning with local habitat studies and concluding with musings about the Internet. In response to the environmental crisis, we must reimagine our relationship to the places we inhabit. This volume shows how literature and literary studies are fundamental tools to such a reimagining.<br>

  Abstract: As the world moves beyond nationalism into larger global corporate communities, one response has been to retreat to proximity and, in Kirkpatrick Sale’s terms, to “dwell in place.” The “imagined community” (Anderson) of the bioregion is human sized: it is a homeland not a nation. The notion of the “bioregional imagination” as explored throughout this book is created by place-conscious literature, art, natural-history writing, and thoughtful daily living. It is an effort to cultivate the sort of community Sale and others imagine, one that, many believe, might enable us to dwell more sustainably in place. What I investigate here, however,<br>

Ash and pumice buried the Alaska Peninsula villages of Katmai and Douglas and the seasonally operated fish-processing camp at Kaflia Bay and fell two feet deep on the city of Kodiak, 115 miles away. The explosion spawned continuous thunder and lightning storms and resulted in total darkness for more than forty-eight hours.

  Book Title: The Archaeology of Class War-The Colorado Coalfield Strike of 1913-1914<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

  Abstract: The Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project (CCWAP) strove to complement the written history of the 1913–1914 labor strike in southern Colorado. While the written history provides a thorough description of the events and their larger implications, it does not paint a complete picture of how the events affected the daily lives of the men, women, and children who experienced them. Further, it cannot show the living conditions that led up to the strike or illustrate the strike’s effect on the material conditions of the workers and their families. Such is the nature of history.

  Abstract: The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,<br>

  Abstract: The Ludlow Project is an explicitly political project, an attempt to fuse scholarly labor with working-class interests (Ludlow Collective 2001:95). The goal of working with union members and organized labor, an audience outside the traditional realm of archaeology, confronts us with a history little studied by archaeologists and little taught within general historical education. The Ludlow Massacre, like many historical episodes, is a silenced history, written out to the margins of national history. The Ludlow Massacre helped change the lives of working-class people throughout the United States, so its absence in official history, and the absence of events like it,<br>

  Book Title: The Sacredness of the Person-A New Genealogy of Human Rights<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Skinner Alex<br>
  Abstract: According to Joas, every single human being has increasingly been viewed as sacred. He discusses the abolition of torture and slavery, once common practice in the pre-18th century west, as two milestones in modern human history. The author concludes by portraying the emergence of the UN Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 as a successful process of value generalization. Joas demonstrates that the history of human rights cannot adequately be described as a history of ideas or as legal history, but as a complex transformation in which diverse cultural traditions had to be articulated, legally codified, and assimilated into practices of everyday life. The sacralization of the person and universal human rights will only be secure in the future, warns Joas, through continued support by institutions and society, vigorous discourse in their defense, and their incarnation in everyday life and practice.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt4cg8vx">The Sacredness of the Person</a><br>
  Abstract: This book deals with the history of human rights and the problem of their justification. But it provides neither a comprehensive intellectual or legal history nor a new philosophical justification for the idea of universal human dignity and the human rights based upon it. Anyone harboring such expectations will be disappointed. This is not for essentially trivial reasons, such as the fact that—despite all the impressive preparatory work that has been done—further in-depth research is needed for any comprehensive history of human rights. Nor is it because any of the existing philosophical justifications, those put forward by Kant,<br>

  Abstract: If we look at the vast literature on the prehistory and history of human rights, the defining impression is that “success has many parents.” The triumphal march of human rights is undoubtedly one of the great success stories in the realm of values and norms. Even those inclined toward skepticism in light of the many conspicuous cases of empty human rights rhetoric or the cynical, legitimizing misuse of the term will be able—to quote an old dictum—to discern in such cant a compliment to morality and its central importance.

In the following chapter, which presents a number of intermediate methodological reflections, I aim to flesh out this concept and thus the method used in this book. Within the context of contemporary debates in the philosophy and history of human rights, it is vital to explain why we should be attempting to produce a “genealogy” of human rights in the first place, as opposed to a rational justification for their validity claims or a simple history of their ascent and spread. We must also explain why,<br>

  Abstract: The key thesis underlying the three historical-sociological discussions presented in this book is that we should understand the rise of human rights and the idea of universal human dignity as a process of the sacralization of the person. Inherent in this thesis is a rejection of all notions that this rise can be regarded as the product of a particular tradition, such as the Christian—a product that was more or less bound to emerge from the seed of tradition at some point in history. Traditions as such, I suggest, generate nothing. What matters is how they are appropriated by<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt4cg8vx">The Sacredness of the Person</a><br>
  Abstract: So far in my attempt to construct an affirmative genealogy of human rights I have placed great emphasis on the importance of subjective certainty, the sense of self-evidence and affective intensity of the kind characteristic of the sacred. I have portrayed the genesis and development of human rights as a history of the relocating of such self-evidence, a process that straddles the spheres of practices, values, and institutions. So experiences are an important driving force in this history—everyday experiences, but above all experiences that transcend the everyday, that fill actors with enthusiasm or affect them profoundly as their horror<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  Author(s) Peng Kuo-Wei<br>
  Abstract: The history of Protestant Chinese Bible translation is a long and complex one, 1 and therefore the role of the KJV in Protestant Chinese Bible translation needs to be discussed stage by stage. The first stage begins with the translation work of the first Protestant missionaries; the second stage begins with the first (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt at a Chinese Union Version; the third stage is an era of a plethora of Chinese Bible translations; and the last stage I wish to discuss starts with the translation process that led to the completion of a Union Version.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjgtt">The King James Version at 400</a><br>
  Author(s) Sadler Rodney<br>
  Abstract: The King James Version of the Bible has been a prominent factor influencing the course of Western history for the past four hundred years. You need look no further than the African American community to find evidence for this claim. As a people, African Americans were not easy converts to Christianity. In fact, it took more than a century, two Great Awakenings, and the typically more egalitarian evangelistic tactics of the Baptists and Methodists for Christianity to begin to make significant inroads into African American communities. But more than these sociological factors, it took the stories from the pages of<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

  Abstract: From the perspective of media sensibilities, the academic discipline of biblical scholarship is in no small measure intertwined with typography, the technological invention that mediated both the biblical manuscripts themselves and our interpretations of them. This alliance between print technology and the academic study of the Bible has been a long and close one, although it has largely remained unrecognized by the discipline. For the past five centuries Western history, and particularly the literate elite, has managed verbal communication under the spell of the print medium. The shift from script to print has had a major part in the three<br>

  Abstract: Of all the verses in the New Testament, few have been more deeply implicated in the bloodstained history of Jewish-Christian relations than the Matthean rendition of the people’s response to Pilate and his declaration of his own innocence: “His [Jesus’] blood be on us and on our children” (Matt 27:25). In keeping with a Semitic idiom that the blood of someone who has been wronged will be required from the perpetrators of evil (Lev 20:9; 1 Sam 4:11; Jer 26:15), the people in Matthew’s passion narrative voluntarily accept the consequences of Jesus’ death.

  Abstract: Although a restlessly interdisciplinary mind, Ong was strictly speaking an expert in the literary and intellectual history of the Renaissance, and not a biblical scholar.

As far as his intellectual persona is concerned, he managed to assimilate deep introspection with a sometimes astonishing pragmatism, and a limitless curiosity about virtually all aspects of human knowledge with an unfailing commitment to<br>

  Abstract: Fraleigh's brilliantly inventive fusions of philosophy and movement clarify often complex philosophical issues and apply them to dance history and aesthetics. She illustrates her discussions with photographs, dance descriptions, and stories from her own past in order to bridge dance with everyday movement. Seeking to recombine the fractured and bifurcated conceptions of the body and of the senses that dominate much Western discourse, she reveals how metaphysical concepts are embodied and presented in dance, both on stage and in therapeutic settings.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hjqxd">A Counter-History of Composition</a><br>
  Abstract: In the history of rhetoric and composition, the year 1980 is unique: it solidified one historical trajectory, started another, and covered over a third. Throughout the 1970s, rhetoric and composition was growing as a discipline: theories from the history of rhetoric were coming back to inform composition and composition was developing its own knowledge base through scholars’ cognitive and ethnographic research on writers. By 1980, Richard Young had summed up these developments and set the tone for their expansion in his article “Arts, Crafts, Gifts, and Knacks.” But also in 1980, James Berlin wrote “The Rhetoric of Romanticism,” which, unbeknownst<br>

Consequently, I would situate this book in the line of revisionist histories from Albert Kitzhaber to James Berlin and from Sharon Crowley to Robert Connors. I am building on the examination of what gets excluded from other (more dominant) histories in order to rethink received concepts and categories that at this point are more of an impediment to the growth of the field than a useful conceptual starting place or map.

  Book Title: Illness as Narrative-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Jurecic Ann<br>
  Abstract: For most of literary history, personal confessions about illness were considered too intimate to share publicly. By the mid-twentieth century, however, a series of events set the stage for the emergence of the illness narrative. The increase of chronic disease, the transformation of medicine into big business, the women's health movement, the AIDS/HIV pandemic, the advent of inexpensive paperbacks, and the rise of self-publishing all contributed to the proliferation of narratives about encounters with medicine and mortality.While the illness narrative is now a staple of the publishing industry, the genre itself has posed a problem for literary studies. What is the role of criticism in relation to personal accounts of suffering? Can these narratives be judged on aesthetic grounds? Are they a collective expression of the lost intimacy of the patient-doctor relationship? Is their function thus instrumental-to elicit the reader's empathy?To answer these questions, Ann Jurecic turns to major works on pain and suffering by Susan Sontag, Elaine Scarry, and Eve Sedgwick and reads these alongside illness narratives by Jean-Dominique Bauby, Reynolds Price, and Anne Fadiman, among others. In the process, she defines the subgenres of risk and pain narratives and explores a range of critical responses guided, alternately, by narrative empathy, the hermeneutics of suspicion, and the practice of reparative reading.
      Illness as Narrativeseeks to draw wider attention to this form of life writing and to argue for new approaches to both literary criticism and teaching narrative. Jurecic calls for a practice that's both compassionate and critical. She asks that we consider why writers compose stories of illness, how readers receive them, and how both use these narratives to make meaning of human fragility and mortality.<br>

Is the space between fictional historical rewritings and historical progress not always the site of an ethical dispute?

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

  Book Title: American Creoles-The Francophone Caribbean and the American South<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Britton Celia<br>
  Abstract: The Francophone Caribbean and the American South are sites born of the plantation, the common matrix for the diverse nations and territories of the circum-Caribbean. This book takes as its premise that the basic configuration of the plantation, in terms of its physical layout and the social relations it created, was largely the same in the Caribbean and the American South. Essays written by leading authorities in the field examine the cultural, social, and historical affinities between the Francophone Caribbean and the American South, including Louisiana, which among the Southern states has had a quite particular attachment to France and the Francophone world. The essays focus on issues of history, language, politics and culture in various forms, notably literature, music and theatre. Considering figures as diverse as Barack Obama, Frantz Fanon, Miles Davis, James Brown, Edouard Glissant, William Faulkner, Maryse Condé and Lafcadio Hearn, the essays explore in innovative ways the notions of creole culture and creolization, terms rooted in and indicative of contact between European and African people and cultures in the Americas, and which are promoted here as some of the most productive ways for conceiving of the circum-Caribbean as a cultural and historical entity.<br>

  Author(s) Loichot Valérie<br>

  Abstract: William Faulkner, Édouard Glissant and Maryse Condé all come from that part of the world that we can define as the American Tropics, and therefore share a common history of plantation slavery. Within that history, however, they occupy very different positions – Faulkner as the descendant of slaveowners, Glissant and Condé as the descendants of slaves. In addition, the American South and the Caribbean have very different attitudes towards the question of racial mixing, pejoratively known as miscegenation in the United States and positively as métissage or creolization in the Caribbean.

  Abstract: It is a foolish commentator indeed who would attempt to claim a precise moment in history when anthropology in the French-speaking world

That anthropology was one of the handmaidens of colonialism, a science of empire, is indisputable and well documented.

  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WYLIE LESLEY<br>
  Abstract: Coming to prominence during the tropical booms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Putumayo has long been a site of mass immigration and exile, of subjugation and insurgency, and of violence. By way of a study of literature of and on the Putumayo by Latin American as well as US and European writers, Colombia’s Forgotten Frontier explores the history and enduring significance of this Amazonian border zone, which has been visited both physically and imaginatively by figures such as Roger Casement, José Eustasio Rivera, and William Burroughs. Travel writing, testimony, diaries, letters, journalism, oral history, songs, photographs, and ‘pulp’ fiction are all considered alongside more conventional forms such as the novel. Whilst geographically peripheral, the Putumayo has played a central role in Colombia and beyond, both historically and, crucial to this study, culturally, producing a literature of extreme experience, marginality, and conflict.<br>

  Book Title: Commemorating the Irish Famine-Memory and the Monument<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): MARK-FITZGERALD EMILY<br>
  Abstract: Commemorating the Irish Famine: Memory and the Monument presents for the first time a visual cultural history of the 1840s Irish Famine, tracing its representation and commemoration from the 19th century up to its 150th anniversary in the 1990s and beyond. As the watershed event of 19th century Ireland, the Famine’s political and social impacts profoundly shaped modern Ireland and the nations of its diaspora. Yet up until the 1990s, the memory of the Famine remained relatively muted and neglected, attracting little public attention. Thus the Famine commemorative boom of the mid-1990s was unprecedented in scale and output, with close to one hundred monuments newly constructed across Ireland, Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia. Drawing on an extensive global survey of recent community and national responses to the Famine’s anniversary, and by outlining why these memories matter and to whom, this book argues how the phenomenon of Famine commemoration may be understood in the context of a growing memorial culture worldwide. It offers an innovative look at a well-known migration history whilst exploring how a now-global ethnic community redefines itself through acts of public memory and representation.<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1845–52 in Ireland known as the ‘Great Famine’ constituted a cataclysm unequalled in Irish history. With more than a million dead from starvation and disease, and more than a million in exodus from Ireland to Britain, North America and Australia, today Ireland remains one of the only European nations whose population is smaller than during the nineteenth century. Precipitated by the potato blight, the Famine was exacerbated by a colonial administration whose failure to alleviate the crisis proved disastrous: the impact of the Famine devastated Irish culture, language, and social demographics, formed the basis for the massive<br>

  Abstract: If twentieth-century attempts to give visual form to Famine memory are to be understood within a tradition of Famine image-making, the obvious antecedents lie in the visual representations of the Irish Famine from the nineteenth century. How was the Famine visually represented and interpreted in its own time, and what meanings do such images communicate? The evolution of the visual culture and representational history of ‘the Famine’ has yet to be satisfactorily mapped, and the relationship of its nineteenth-century iconography to latter-day visualizations both troubles and intrigues.

  6  Major Famine Memorials from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkfn">Commemorating the Irish Famine</a><br>
  Abstract: Monuments to the Irish Famine can be found in communities across three continents; while the majority remain relatively unseen, unknown affairs, a small proportion has attained widespread recognition and attention. These memorials are the products of sustained, well-funded, and organized commemorative efforts, usually supported by an infrastructure of official and/or national bodies, and present an embodiment of Famine memory explicitly intended for wider viewership. As a consequence, many bear the scars of protracted civic negotiation and politicized appropriation, of artistic vision and compromise, and of struggles between competing versions of Irish history and identity. They are, in every sense, ‘monumental’<br>

  12  French Linguistics Research and Teaching in UK and Irish HE Institutions from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Myles Florence<br>
  Abstract: The research and teaching of French linguistics in UK higher education (HE) institutions have a venerable history; a number of universities have traditionally offered philology or history of the language courses, which complement literary study. A deeper understanding of the way that the phonology, syntax and semantics of the French language have evolved gives students linguistic insights that dovetail with their study of the
                  Roman de Renart, Rabelais, Racine or thenouveau roman. There was, in the past, some coverage of contemporary French phonetics but little on sociolinguistic issues. More recently, new areas of research and teaching have been developed,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Kelly Debra<br>
  Abstract: France provides a particularly complex and fascinating object of analysis for any investigation into the impact of war on modern and contemporary cultural production and cultural history, having been at war for almost fifty years of the twentieth century. This impact is characterised by radically different experiences and memories of the two world wars, and further complicated by enduring legacies of those wars, and of subsequent, brutal colonial wars. An understanding of the impact that the experiences of these different types of war have made on French cultural, social and political identity is essential for the broader analysis of developments<br>

  Abstract: The Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France (ASMCF) sees its contribution to promoting knowledge of France mainly, but not exclusively, through the area studies approach, which is broadly the study of the country including its political system, history, geography and general culture integrated with its language.

  Abstract: Within the relativistic framework of Enlightenment philosopy, a number of coherent thematic groupings stand out more than others: a secularised deismor atheism, an expanded awareness of the value of foreign cultures, and the transformative idea that history will never return to its starting point – a notion that for some like Fontenelle, Turgot or Condorcet was elevated to a belief in progress.<br>

  Abstract: In his bestselling sermon for Rochester’s funeral, Robert Parsons, chaplain to the Earl’s mother, claimed that Rochester had made a last request that ‘those persons, in whose custody his Papers were’, would ‘burn all his profane and lewd Writings, as being only fit to promote Vice and Immorality’.¹ Parsons’ image of Rochester’s shameful and blasphemous texts ablaze with the flames of Holy Religion is particularly apt in the light of their subsequent publication history.

  Book Title: Varieties of World Making-Beyond Globalization<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): WAGNER PETER<br>
  Abstract: Globalization has been the topic of heated debate in recent years, with one side asserting that it will produce a better standard of living for people around the world, and a fierce opposition arguing that it will ultimately lead to greater poverty and the destruction of unique human cultures. Varieties of World Making tackles the issue from a different angle, proposing that the contemporary global network of business, politics and culture be viewed from the inter-disciplinary perspective of ‘world making’. Drawn from the ranks of sociology, law, international relations, political philosophy and history, the distinguished contributors cut through polarized rhetoric to examine the current global situation. Their proposed diagnoses draw upon thoughtful analyses of various political dilemmas whose ripple effects are felt around the world, such as the volatile relationship between Islam and Europe, or the legal foundations for a true international order absent in the shadows of imperialism. Varieties of World Making will be an essential resource for all those grappling with the complex consequences of globalization for the future.<br>

  Author(s) Mouzakitis Angelos<br>
  Abstract: Implicit in the idea of world-making are the assumptions that human beings are the makers of their own history and that in the incessant shaping of their socio-historical worlds they experience some sort of commonality. This dual presupposition entails the attribution of at least some sort of control to both individuals and emerging collectivities over the status and direction of socio-historical institutions and life-trajectories. The allegedly ‘common’ world, emerging and/or persisting in time, poses a number of theoretical problems, of which this chapter attempts to examine only those relating to its creation and constitution.

  Book Title: V. Y. Mudimbe-Undisciplined Africanism<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): FRAITURE PIERRE-PHILIPPE<br>
  Abstract: VY Mudimbe: Undisciplined Africanism is the first English-language monograph dedicated to the work of Valentin Yves Mudimbe. This book charts the intellectual history of the seminal Congolese philosopher, epistemologist, and philologist from the late 1960s to the present day, exploring his major essays and novels. Pierre-Philippe Fraiture highlights Mudimbe’s trajectory through major debates on African nationalism, Panafricanism, neo-colonialism, negritude, pedagogy, Christianisation, decolonisation, anthropology, postcolonial representations, and a variety of other subjects, using these as contexts for close readings of many of Mudimbe’s texts, both influential and lesser-known. The book demonstrates that Mudimbe’s intellectual career has been informed by a series of decisive dialogues with some of the key exponents of Africanism (Herodotus, EW Blyden, Placide Tempels), continental and postcolonial thought (Jean-Paul Sartre, Frantz Fanon, Michel Foucault, and Claude Lévi-Strauss), and African thought and philosophy from Africa and the diaspora (L.S. Senghor, Patrice Nganang, and Achille Mbembe).<br>

  Abstract: Over 100 days, BBC Radio 4 set out to present, in a series of short programmes broadcast from 18 January to 22 October 2010, ‘a history of the world in 100 objects’. What was noteworthy about this enterprise was the use of the indefinite article – ‘a’ history – as it would nowadays indeed be a little presumptuous to embark on

  Conclusion: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjnck">V. Y. Mudimbe</a><br>
  Abstract: ‘Reading Mudimbe’, argues Kai Kresse, ‘means engaging in an intellectual space where African studies just cannot happen in splendid isolation from other disciplines, in disjunction from the European history of the study of humanities’.¹ Indeed, V. Y. Mudimbe conjures up the image of a
                  fabulouslyinquisitive reader sifting and collating data across disciplines. The adverb ‘fabulously’ is used here to reiterate the author’s belief that essays and exegeses are also fables, that is,attemptsto translate what can, at best, only be transformed. His presence at the intersection of several ‘libraries’ bears witness to his ambition to read Africa as<br>

  Abstract: In recent years the concepts of rite of passage and, in particular, of liminality have figured prominently in medical and medical-related research, providing useful ways of analysing a range of experiences of illness and disability. With the expansion of the medical humanities and the development of ‘narrative medicine’, medical practitioners have looked to other disciplines – literary analysis, philosophy, history and anthropology – for models and metaphors by which to express the experiences of patients, carers and clinicians. The attraction of the notion of rite of passage is obvious, offering a versatile means of expressing a range of phenomena including:<br>

  Abstract: Among acts by individuals that challenge social and religious norms, suicide ranks among the most transgressive. The part played by religion and, in particular, Christianity in the stigmatisation of the act of self-destruction and the individual who kills or attempts to kill himself/herself has, of course, been rehearsed on countless occasions. As Georges Minois points out in his overview of the history of suicide, the early Christian Church seemed to give out mixed messages on the question: the earthly life is a vale of tears and the Christian should aspire to death so that he/she can be united with God<br>

The essays in this volume, written by friends and colleagues who have drawn inspiration from and shown interest in the scholarship of David Clines, engage with his work through examining interpretations of the Hebrew Bible in areas of common exploration: literary/exegetical readings, ideological-critical readings, language and lexicography, and reception history.

  Abstract: “I stand to be corrected, but I believe that every interpretation of and commentary on this psalm ever written adopts the viewpoint of the text, and, moreover, assumes that the readers addressed by the scholarly commentator share the ideology of the text and its author.” So writes David Clines in his “Psalm 2 and the MLF (Moab Liberation Front).” ¹ A study of the reception history of this psalm undoubtedly bears this out: David is indeed one of very few to question the ideological stance of the psalmist.² He looks at Ps 2 from the point of view of its<br>

This issue may look like a mere technicality, of no interest for exegesis, history of religion, and literary criticism, but actually it is of highest importance, for it relates to the status of the speaking characters. On the face of it, the matter seems rather trivial: when the participants in the dialogue are unknown to the reader, they are to be mentioned by name and/or title, for the sake of clarity; but when it is clear whose move it is, no explicit indication is necessary.

  Abstract: Many humanities and social science scholars today are committed to, or at any rate, pay lip service to ideals of interdisciplinarity and methodological cross-fertilization. In light of this fact, it is remarkable that there should be so little dialogue between historians of philosophy (including those who study political and religious philosophy) and intellectual historians, particularly with respect to study of ‘non-Western’ thought systems or world views. A common tendency among intellectual historians today is to reduce history of philosophy to a minor province of philosophical hermeneutics. The increasingly ahistorical philosophical hermeneuticists, in turn, usually prioritize exposition and internal analysis of<br>

  Abstract: The history of science is replete with experimentalists who, like the princes of Serendip, “were always making discoveries, by accident or sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.”¹ Because of its conventional presentational format, scientific experimentation might appear to some to be an extremely orderly, even formulaic sequence of steps that all experimentalists follow in their efforts to contribute to the smoothly cumulative, linear advancement of scientific knowledge. However, in an analysis of the history of science it becomes apparent that many great discoveries were happy accidents discovered by creative and perceptive workers through absorption in inventive experimental<br>

At any given instant, we both live history and live in history. For the dance historian, struggling with questions of historiography, the relationship of past and present is doubly complex.

  Abstract: Dance history, like other academic disciplines, is influenced by contemporary trends in education and the new directions in scholarship that those trends produce. For more than a decade, the reassessment of research goals has been influenced by issues of multiculturalism and diversity in American education. As university curricula continue to be restructured in acknowledgment of the diverse roots of America’s intellectual and cultural heritage, scholars from various disciplines are searching for ways to include traditionally disenfranchised voices in their discourses. Such developments have increasingly influenced dance history scholars to recognize that diverse and historically marginalized groups have made profound contributions<br>

Isaiah seems to have found the inversion to be not only possible, but as detectable as it is detestable. I also suspect that he was less concerned than I am to rise to the defense of neurofunctionalism. Nonetheless, I join in his rejection of quality inversion. In prosaic modern terms,<br>

Preeminent More scholar Clarence H. Miller does justice to the full range of More's rhetoric in this masterful translation. In a new afterword to this edition, Jerry Harp contextualizes More's life andUtopiawithin the wider frames of European humanism and the Renaissance."Clarence H.

Clarence H. Miller's wonderful translation of More's classic is now happily once again available to readers. This is the English edition that best captures the tone and texture of More's original Latin, and its notes and introduction, along with the lively afterward by Jerry Harp, graciously supply exactly the kinds of help a modern reader might desire."-David Scott Kastan, Yale University<br>

  Book Title: The Allure of the Archives-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Natalie Zemon<br>
  Abstract: Arlette Farge's
      Le Goût de l'archiveis widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. InThe Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive's allure can forever change how we understand the past.<br>

There’s certainly something a little quaint about spending years of research obstinately parsing reports of lives led centuries ago, even as increasingly elaborate new ways of thinking about history are all the while being formulated and reformulated. But we should not forget to what extent the judicial archives themselves made many of these breakthroughs possible in the first<br>

  Abstract: Talk of the relations between “science” and “religion” first became audible in the early 1800s, about the time that students of nature began referring to their work as science rather than natural philosophy (or natural history). Because natural philosophy allowed its practitioners, in the words of Isaac Newton, to discourse about God “from the appearances of things,” one searches almost in vain for references to “natural philosophy and religion.” Some writers expressed concern about tension between faith and reason, but they never pitted religion against science.¹<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wp6f3">Preserving and Exhibiting Media Art</a><br>
  Author(s) Hediger Vinzenz<br>
  Abstract: What is media art? Providing a working definition of its object is critical to any emerging new field of study, but particularly to the field of media art. The product of practices that often involve rapidly changing technologies and ephemeral performance elements, media art is difficult for critics, curators, and archivists to pin down in terms of the established taxonomies of art history or film and media studies. Laying the groundwork for the following parts of the book, this part offers four different approaches to the methodological, theoretical, and practical challenges involved in developing a taxonomy of media art that<br>

  Abstract: Documentation is the process of gathering and organizing information about a work, including its condition, its content, its context, and the actions taken to preserve it. For the writing of art history one used to be able to rely on the art objects. When artworks become prone to obsolescence or are only meant to exist for a short period, documentation is the only thing people can fall back on. The traditional documentation strategy for the conservation of art is focused on describing the object, in the best objective way possible. But conservation as a practice is not as fixed as<br>

  Abstract: Within a framework of the system of relations between “technology” and “culture,” the third part of this book is dedicated to preservation and restoration theories and practices, and has two sides. On one hand (in chapter 7), the history of research and technological innovation in the media area is highlighted, also in the case of “low cost” examples, emphasizing the deconstruction and reinvention processes produced by artistic practices with respect to the industrial structures of cinema (7.1), television (7.2), and information technology (7.3). On the other hand (in chapter 8), epistemological frameworks are introduced, as well as working methodologies, projects,<br>

  Abstract: The Bay of Bengal was once a region at the heart of global history. It was forgotten in the second half of the twentieth century, carved up by the boundaries of nation-states, its shared past divided into the separate compartments of national histories. The regions that gave shape to the postwar organization of academic knowledge—the “areas” of area studies—drew a sharp distinction between “South Asia,” on one hand, and “Southeast Asia,” on the other: the line between them ran right through the middle of the Bay. The rise and decline of the Bay as a connected region is<br>

  Abstract: Here is surely a truth now universally acknowledged: that the whole of our cultural inheritance has to be recurated and reedited in digital forms and institutional structures. But as the technology of cultural memory shifts from bibliographical to digital machines, a difficult question arises: what do we do with the books? This is a problem for society at large and many people are working at it, none more assiduously than certain expert persons, often technicians. Highly skilled and motivated as they are, book history and the complex machineries of books fall outside their professional expertise. Humanist scholars, the long-recognized monitors<br>

  Abstract: Analyzing the career and the work of a great artist assumes that it is possible to describe a fragment of the history of the world subject to the laws of causality, and at the same time to endow the artist with the power to act: The artist’s greatness can then be characterized by his ability to change the predictable course of things (in the artistic world and beyond it, directly or indirectly, in the world in general)—an ability to which causes and reasons must be assigned. That is why works on artistic greatness or genius hesitate between several formulas.<br>

  Author(s): Pratt Dale J.<br>
  Abstract: Signs of Science: Literature, Science, and spa Modernity since 1868 traces how spa culture represented scientific activity from the mid-nineteenth century onward. The book combines the global perspective afforded by historical narrative with detailed rhetorical analyses of images of science in specific literary and scientific texts. As literary criticism it seeks to illuminate similarities and differences in how science and scientists are pictured; as cultural history it follows the course of a centuries-long dialogue about Spain and science.<br>

This historical narrative arises from detailed rhetorical analysis of the themes and poetics that make up literary images of science. It finds its inspiration in the intellectual preoccupations of the period it encompasses. The irony implicit in a study of multifarious images is that its own imaging of real processes in nineteenth-and twentieth-century Spanish culture remains unavoidably incomplete.

  Author(s) Bartchy S. Scott<br>
  Abstract: The eminent Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson observes in his 1991 prize-winning book titled

  Abstract: In the last few decades, Germany and Austria have experienced a staggering expansion of the field of Jewish studies.¹ They have been set up either as separate institutes within a faculty or as programs that consist of courses related to Jewish history and culture offered by various departments. The development of Jewish studies is closely connected to political and cultural processes in society at large and cannot be described properly without taking them into account.

  Book Title: Genre Fusion-A New Approach to History, Fiction, and Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Brenneis Sara J.<br>
  Abstract: Genre Fusion opens with a straightforward overview of the relationships among history, fiction, and memory in contemporary culture. While providing an up-to-date context for scholarly debates about Spain’s historical memory, Genre Fusion also expands the contours of the discussion beyond the specialized territory of Hispanic studies. To demonstrate the theoretical necessity of genre fusion, Brenneis analyzes pairs of interconnected texts (one a work of literature, the other a work of historiography) written by a single author. She explores how fictional and nonfictional works by Montserrat Roig, Carmen Martín Gaite, Carlos Blanco Aguinaga, and Javier Marías unearth the collective memories of Spain’s past.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wq3rh">Genre Fusion</a><br>
  Abstract: Aristotle theorized the relationship between history and fiction in the fourth century BC by writing that although the historian and the poet may use the same narrative tools, their “true difference is that one relates what has happened, the other what may happen” (68). By that token, the Greek philosopher wrote, “poetry tends to express the universal, history the particular” (68). Yet Aristotle foresaw the central issue that would stymie narratologists and historians in the coming centuries: What happens when the poet writes about history? According to Aristotle, he remains a poet, not a historian: “for there is no reason<br>

Although Lukács’s observations are trained on early nineteenth-century movements in Europe, they are equally applicable to the re-emergence of the<br>

  Book Title: The Jewish Jesus-Revelation, Reflection, Reclamation<br>
  Publisher: Purdue University Press<br>
  Author(s): Garber Zev<br>
  Abstract: There is a general understanding within religious and academic circles that the incarnate Christ of Christian belief lived and died a faithful Jew. This volume addresses Jesus in the context of Judaism. By emphasizing his Jewishness, the authors challenge today’s Jews to reclaim the Nazarene as a proto-rebel rabbi and invite Christians to discover or rediscover the Church’s Jewish heritage. The essays in this volume cover historical, literary, liturgical, philosophical, religious, theological, and contemporary issues related to the Jewish Jesus. Several of them were originally presented at a three-day symposium on “Jesus in the Context of Judaism and the Challenge to the Church,” hosted by the Samuel Rosenthal Center for Judaic Studies at Case Western Reserve University in 2009. In the context of pluralism, in the temper of growing interreligious dialogue, and in the spirit of reconciliation, encountering Jesus as living history for Christians and Jews is both necessary and proper. This book will be of particular interest to scholars of the New Testament and Early Church who are seeking new ways of understanding Jesus in his religious and cultural milieu, as well Jewish and Christian theologians and thinkers who are concerned with contemporary Jewish and Christian relationships.<br>

  Author(s) Tihanov Galin<br>
  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet (1879-1937) has emerged as one of the most prominent Russian philosophers of the twentieth century. The principle promoter of Husserlian phenomenology, at the same time creatively modifying Husserl and at times departing from him, Shpet was also an early advocate of hermeneutics. He left behind seminal work spanning philosophy, aesthetics, psychology, literary and theater theory, and the history of Russian thought. Significantly, many of his concerns anticipate preoccupations that have dominated the discourses of cultural theory and the philosophy of language over the last few decades.<br>

  Abstract: Gustav Gustavovich Shpet is re-emerging as a major figure in twentieth-century intellectual history. As the person who introduced Russia to phenomenology, he has had a powerful impact on a wide range of intellectual debates in Russia and beyond. This impact, however, was ignored or consciously downplayed in the USSR. Starting in the 1930s, Shpet became largely invisible in official Soviet scholarly discourse, a tendency that was only exacerbated during the decades after his execution in 1937. This tendency is one of the factors that contributed to Shpet's being so little known in the West today.<br>

  Abstract: "Hermeneutics and Its Problems" offers a concise critical history of hermeneutics—"the general theory of understanding and interpretation," from its Greek and Hellenistic origins, through the formulations, focused on Biblical interpretation, of medieval, Renaissance, and Reformation theorists, to the British, Scottish and French thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It concludes with a close examination of the (mainly German) hermeneutical systems of the early nineteenth century, which culminated in the work of Schleiermacher and Boeckh, and the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century developments in Dilthey and Husserl. This brief outline suggests why Soviet censors did not permit the publication<br>

  Abstract: Representations of the Holocaust in literature raise some problems that do not emerge when dealing with other historical events—at least not so obviously. On the one hand, we are faced with problems of methods and the cultural consequences of historical representation; on the other hand, there are questions related to certain claims made by scholars of contemporary philosophy of history, asserting the relative character of historical representation. According to this relativist perspective—expressed most clearly in Hayden White's "metahistory"—any kind of historical narrative is legitimate, or more precisely, there is no external viewpoint from which any of these<br>

  Author(s): Maraldo John C.<br>
  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way it has shaped and been shaped by its great thinkers over the centuries.24 illus.<br>

Tradition says he was born of an aristocratic family, orphaned, and at the age of twelve joined the Tendai Buddhist monastic community on Mt Hiei in northeastern Kyoto. In search of an ideal teacher, he soon wandered off from the central community on the mountain and ended up in a small temple in eastern Kyoto, Kennin-ji.

There are five or six major traditions within Japanese Buddhist thought, but Zen and Pure Land are given their own sections here because of their prominence in Japanese philosophical history since the thirteenth century.

  Abstract: In Japan the category “twentieth-century philosophy” is reserved by and large for philosophical thought as it is found in Europe and the United States, and for Japanese engagement with it. When writing of their own intellectual history, Japanese scholars tend to follow the same divisions as Japanese history in general. This means that philosophers of the past hundred years are located either in the imperial era in which they flourished (Meiji, Taishō, Shōwa, Heisei); in their relationship to Japanese “modernity” (the establishment of Japan as a modern nation dating from the

In 1953 he wrote a Japanese history textbook, which was censored by the Ministry of Education due to “factual errors,” and Ienaga filed a lawsuit against the Ministry in a well-publicized case. The selection below focuses on another side of Ienaga and offers in translation an excerpt from the second chapter of his ambitious first book,

  Abstract: Few intellectuals in Japan have left such a conspicuous mark on postwar intellectual discourse as Maruyama Masao. He is known for his active political stance in the postwar period as well as for his academic accomplishments. During the first part of his academic career, he focused on an analysis of early-modern and modern Japanese thought, inspired by the methods of Marx, Mannheim, and Weber. Later on, he devoted more energy to an elucidation of the particularities of Japanese intellectual history as a whole. Throughout his lifetime, he remained an opinion-leader of the liberal left.<br>

  Abstract: Ever since Socrates accepted the Delphic oracle’s challenge to “know thyself,” the issue of personal identity has been part of the western philosophical repertoire. That issue typically broke down into two fundamental questions. The first was one of individual identity: who am I? The second was one of universal identity: what characterizes our humanity? Only in recent history has the West added questions of cultural, linguistic, and ethnic identity: for example, what does it mean to be French Canadian? Three circumstances have supported this rather new enterprise. The first is the rise of the social sciences, especially cultural anthropology, sociology,<br>

They had no clear agenda, either political or intellectual. Mainly, they wanted to explore what “modernity” means: its roots in Europe, its impact on Japan, and its meaning for the future.

  Abstract: The question of whether there is such a thing as samurai philosophy, and if so, what it might consist of, is one of the more complex issues in Japanese intellectual history. This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  Abstract: Throughout most of Japan’s history, only a small number of women who had distinguished themselves in literature were able to express their ideas publicly. Not even the increased educational opportunities and the birth of specialized journals dedicated to women’s issues that came with the Meiji Restoration of 1868 were any match for the deeply male view of women as domestic “property” unsuited to intellectual inquiry. We see this reflected in Fukuzawa Yukichi’s* plea to his compatriots in 1899:<br>

This is the opening statement of a work that is considered to be the genealogical moment in the creation of aesthetics as an autonomous philosophical field—a creation prompted by the need to rescue the senses from the primacy of reason.

  Author(s): PERKINS MAUREEN<br>
  Abstract: The thirteen essays in this volume come from Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Malaysia, South Africa, and Hawai'i. With a shared focus on the specific local conditions that influence the ways in which life narratives are told, the authors engage with a variety of academic disciplines, including anthropology, history, media studies, and literature, to challenge claims that life writing is an exclusively Western phenomenon. Addressing the common desire to reflect on lived experience, the authors enlist interdisciplinary perspectives to interrogate the range of cultural forms available for representing and understanding lives.Contributors:Maria Faini, Kenneth George, Philip Holden, David T.

  Book Title: Great Fool-Zen Master Ryokan--Poems, Letters, and Other Writings<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): HASKEL PETER<br>
  Abstract: Taigu Ryokan (1759-1831) remains one of the most popular figures in Japanese Buddhist history. Despite his religious and artistic sophistication, Ryokan referred to himself as "Great Fool" and refused to place himself within the cultural elite of his age. In contrast to the typical Zen master of his time, who presided over a large monastery, trained students, and produced recondite religious treatises, Ryokan followed a life of mendicancy in the countryside. Instead of delivering sermons, he expressed himself through kanshi (poems composed in classical Chinese) and waka and could typically be found playing with the village children in the course of his daily rounds of begging. Great Fool is the first study in a Western language to offer a comprehensive picture of the legendary poet-monk and his oeuvre. It includes not only an extensive collection of the master's kanshi, topically arranged to facilitate an appreciation of Ryokan's colorful world, but selections of his waka, essays, and letters. The volume also presents for the first time in English the Ryokan zenji kiwa (Curious Accounts of the Zen Master Ryokan), a firsthand source composed by a former student less than sixteen years after Ryokan's death. Although it lacks chronological order, the Curious Account is invaluable for showing how Ryokan was understood and remembered by his contemporaries. It consists of colorful anecdotes and episodes, sketches from Ryokan's everyday life.<br>

  Introduction from:

  Abstract: Generations have called this beggar-monk of the early nineteenth century “Ryōkan-san,” the informal suffix “
                  san” expressing affectionate respect. Only two other eminent Buddhist figures in Japanese history have received this particular honor: “Kōbō-san” or “Daishi-san,” Kūkai, the ninth-century founder of Shingon Buddhism, who is remembered in popular legends as a savior–miracle worker; and “Ikkyū-san,” the fifteenth-century Zen monk whose eccentric life-style has inspired numerous folk stories in which he is depicted as a marvelously quick-witted child novice. Ryōkan is a singularly attractive figure. Minakami Tsutomu, the celebrated contemporary novelist, explains why, despite countless earlier works examining the minutest details<br>

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s Motiba’s Tattoos); and the development of Chinatowns as family spaces (Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men, Lisa See’s On Gold Mountain, Bruce Edward Hall’s Tea that Burns). The final chapter analyzes the discursive possibilities of the filmed family memoir ("family portrait documentary"), examining Lise Yasui’s A Family Gathering, Ruth Ozeki Lounsbury’s Halving the Bones, and Ann Marie Fleming’s The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam. Davis concludes the work with a metaliterary engagement with the history of her own Asian diasporic family as she demonstrates the profound interconnection between forms of life writing.<br>

  Abstract: The family memoirs analyzed in this chapter illustrate an important facet of Asian history, namely the experience of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Current criticism on Asian American writing generally focuses on issues of displacement, acculturation, or transculturation within American borders, but an examination of the history of immigrants to the United States often reveals a previous narrative of cultural transitions—usually brought about for political or religious reasons—that complicates our notion of the cultural baggage that these immigrants carry.

These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story. Access to these stories also allows readers to understand the development of particular ethnic communities, as the narratives support the production of a history and culture<br>

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  Book Title: The Phantom Heroine-Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLIN JUDITH T.<br>
  Abstract: The "phantom heroine"—in particular the fantasy of her resurrection through sex with a living man—is one of the most striking features of traditional Chinese literature. Even today the hypersexual female ghost continues to be a source of fascination in East Asian media, much like the sexually predatory vampire in American and European movies, TV, and novels. But while vampires can be of either gender, erotic Chinese ghosts are almost exclusively female. The significance of this gender asymmetry in Chinese literary history is the subject of Judith Zeitlin’s elegantly written and meticulously researched new book. Zeitlin’s study centers on the seventeenth century, one of the most interesting and creative periods of Chinese literature and politically one of the most traumatic, witnessing the overthrow of the Ming, the Manchu conquest, and the subsequent founding of the Qing. Drawing on fiction, drama, poetry, medical cases, and visual culture, the author departs from more traditional literary studies, which tend to focus on a single genre or author. Ranging widely across disciplines, she integrates detailed analyses of great literary works with insights drawn from the history of medicine, art history, comparative literature, anthropology, religion, and performance studies. The Phantom Heroine probes the complex literary and cultural roots of the Chinese ghost tradition. Zeitlin is the first to address its most remarkable feature: the phenomenon of verse attributed to phantom writers—that is, authors actually reputed to be spirits of the deceased. She also makes the case for the importance of lyric poetry in developing a ghostly aesthetics and image code. Most strikingly, Zeitlin shows that the representation of female ghosts, far from being a marginal preoccupation, expresses cultural concerns of central importance.<br>

Three days later, the May Fourth uprising occurred in Beijing, initiating one of the most crucial periods in the history of modern China. In the beginning, the New Culture movement was particularly open to novel ideas and programs urging social reform, and given that the central subject of Dewey’s numerous and wide-ranging lectures was to be that of “democracy,” circumstances appeared auspicious for the positive reception of Western democratic ideas. Indeed, Dewey’s influence was significant. Among other things, soon after his arrival, efforts were<br>

One does not need such a Whiggish view of history to notice that the history of the West, at least, has indeed been a story of the development of freedom (whether actualized or idealized). We trace the origins of Western civilization back to the Greek “emancipation” of reason from myth.

  Book Title: Dark Writing-Geography, Performance, Design<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Carter Paul<br>
  Abstract: We do not see empty figures and outlines; we do not move in straight lines. Everywhere we are surrounded by dapple; the geometry of our embodied lives is curviform, meandering, bi-pedal. Our personal worlds are timed, inter-positional, and contingent. But nowhere in the language of cartography and design do these ordinary experiences appear. This, Dark Writing argues, is a serious omission because they are designs on the world: architects and colonizers use their lines to construct the places where we will live. But the rectilinear streets, squares, and public spaces produced in this way leave out people and the entire environmental history of their coming together. How, this book asks, can we explain the omission of bodies from maps and plans? And how can we redraw the lines maps and plans use so that the qualitative world of shadows, footprints, comings and goings, and occasions—all essential qualities of places that incubate sociality—can be registered? In short, Dark Writing asks why we represent the world as static when our experience of it is mobile. It traces this bias in Enlightenment cartography, in inductive logic, and in contemporary place design. This is the negative critique. Its positive argument is that, when we look closely at these designs on the world, we find traces of a repressed movement form. Even the ideal lines of geometrical figures turn out to contain traces of earlier passages; and there are many forms of graphic design that do engage with the dark environment that surrounds the light of reason. How can this "dark writing"—so important to reconfiguring our world as a place of meeting, of co-existence and sustaining diversity—be represented? And how, therefore, can our representations of the world embody more sensuously the mobile histories that have produced it? Dark Writing answers these questions using case studies: the exemplary case of the beginnings of the now world-famous Papunya Tula Painting Movement (Central Australia) and three high-profile public place-making initiatives in which the author was involved as artist and thinker. These case studies are nested inside historical chapters and philosophical discussions of the line and linear thinking that make Dark Writing both a highly personal book and a narrative with wide general appeal.<br>

  CHAPTER 3  Drawing the Line: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wqzx4">Dark Writing</a><br>
  Abstract: The lines that the artist Paul Klee was drawing in 1906–1907 were “my most personal possession,” yet he lamented, “The trouble was that I just couldn’t make them come out. And I could not see them around me, the accord between inside and outside was so hard to achieve.”¹ As the history of coastlines showed, scientists as well as artists have found it hard to connect the ideal lines they carry around in their heads with the actual appearance of the world. In geography this discrepancy has practical, real-world consequences: in the gap opened up by reason’s detachment from<br>

  Abstract: What is “dark writing”? In the first three chapters it referred to the trace of movement that is arrested in spatial representations. A history of journeys, encounters, inclinations, and leaps of faith can be shown to survive in maps and plans once their symbolic character is recognized, and it is these supplementary inscriptions that constitute dark writing. Dark writing alludes to the bodies that go missing in the action of representation. But it does not seek to replace them—to represent them. Aligned to their passage, it registers their passage graphically, as a pattern of traces. In the last three<br>

  Book Title: Christianity in Korea-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Lee Timothy S.<br>
  Abstract: The volume begins with an accessibly written overview that traces in broad outline the history and development of Christianity on the peninsula. This is followed by chapters on broad themes, such as the survival of early Korean Catholics in a Neo-Confucian society, relations between Christian churches and colonial authorities during the Japanese occupation, premillennialism, and the theological significance of the division and prospective reunification of Korea. Others look in more detail at individuals and movements, including the story of the female martyr Kollumba Kang Wansuk; the influence of Presbyterianism on the renowned nationalist Ahn Changho; the sociopolitical and theological background of the Minjung Protestant Movement; and the success and challenges of Evangelical Protestantism in Korea. The book concludes with a discussion of how best to encourage a rapprochement between Buddhism and Christianity in Korea.<br>

  Abstract: Kollumba (Columba) Kang Wansuk (1761–1801), who perished in the great anti-Catholic persecution of 1801, is well known among a small number of historians of Korean Catholicism, but not among more general scholars of Korean history or in the wider field of Korean Studies. She should be more broadly recognized, since aside from her importance as an early Catholic, she was also a remarkable woman who worked in a cause that unfolded outside the home in public space, something that was hardly imaginable for a woman in her time and probably without precedent in earlier Korean history.

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Author(s) SMITS IVO<br>
  Abstract: Unlike those who study Japanese history, scholars of Japan’s literature have long been reluctant to seriously take into account texts written in Chinese, or Sino-Japanese. While this peripheral position of Chinese texts is shifting, it is necessary to restate the obvious: insofar as the written word is concerned, premodern and early modern Japan was a bilingual country. The marginalization of Chinese some two centuries ago resulted in a fading awareness of a large cultural heritage. With the rise of

  Abstract: The significance of the Shingon and Tendai traditions in the history of Japanese Buddhist art during the early Heian period is indisputable. Yet it is important to acknowledge that those teachings were available only to a culturally privileged, literate male minority with close connections to the court.

  Abstract: Crop failure and famine have a long history in Japan. Yet the topic has received virtually no attention in English-language research on the ancient period, meaning here 670 – 1100, nor have Japanese historians specializing in those years systematically analyzed it. This chapter will address three basic and seminal questions about food shortages in that era. First, how frequent and severe were they? The story of these crises in the early modern or Tokugawa period (1600 – 1868) is well-known, and many believe that they had widespread demographic, social, and political effects.¹ Can the same be said for the ancient period?

  Abstract: In 1028 — the very middle of the self-professed era of “peaceful tranquility” — the central aristocracy’s self-complacence was ripped by reports that Taira no Tadatsune (967 – 1031), a maternal grandson of the infamous Taira no Masakado (? – 940), had attacked and ravaged the provincial government compound

  Abstract: In recent decades scholars have questioned two hoary clichés regarding the Heian period: that it was an age of semi-isolation when Japan abandoned its diplomatic ties with China as interest in Chinese culture waned and that it consisted of a well-defined center, its urbane and highly literate capital, surrounded by a vast uncouth, benighted periphery. When regarded as isolated, or at least semi-isolated, the Heian period is part of an implicit periodization scheme, often used but never systematically expressed, that divided Japan’s history into alternating ages of receptivity and rejection of foreign culture: whereas the Nara period was viewed as<br>

  Abstract: Traces of a Streamoffers a unique scholarly perspective that merges interests in rhetorical and literacy studies, United States social and political theory, and African American women writers. Focusing on elite nineteenth-century African American women who formed a new class of women well positioned to use language with consequence, Royster uses interdisciplinary perspectives (literature, history, feminist studies, African American studies, psychology, art, sociology, economics) to present a well-textured rhetorical analysis of the literate practices of these women. With a shift in educational opportunity after the Civil War, African American women gained access to higher education and received formal training in rhetoric and writing. By the end of the nineteenth-century, significant numbers of African American women operated actively in many public arenas.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrcc6">From Darkness To Light</a><br>
  Abstract: THAT TWENTIETH-CENTURY Russia embraced Marxism is perhaps the most striking feature of Russian modern history. Brainchild of Marx, the Soviet Union grew up under the shadow of his vision.¹ Marxist visionaries dreamed of a completely transformed society. Nothing of the corrupt and exploitative past was to be retained in the just, pure future. The victims of the old order were destined to become the rulers of the new. The paragon of Revolution—called a proletarian, a Bolshevik, or a Communist, depending on the speaker and the period—was to become transformed into the “New Man”

  Abstract: IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES, I would like to outline the basic features of Marxist historical mythology, linking it with the Western religious and philosophical concern with human salvation. My core argument is that the attempt to provide scientific principles of historical analysis and to break away from the messianic interpretation of history sponsored by the Church was in fact in many ways unsuccessful: underneath the seemingly new Marxist methodology were concealed older concerns with historical time and redemption. Marxists would doubtless have renounced notions such as good, evil, messiah, and salvation as baseless religious superstitions that had nothing to do<br>

  Abstract: THE MEANING of the term “intelligentsia” was far from immutable between the 1890s and the 1920s. Tracing developments in the revolutionary discourse over a span of three decades, I would like, in the present chapter, to sketch a brief history of “the intelligentsia” in Russian Marxism. Such a history, however, is not susceptible to straightforward chronological presentation. Notions do not develop in the same way biographies do. The main events in the history of notions cannot be precisely defined, let alone dated. Thus, new definitions of the intelligentsia did not simply coincide with the familiar milestones in the history of<br>

  Abstract: It is striking how often literary representations of nature appear within recollections of childhood, or more broadly in the context of acts of remembering. At the same time, memories of the past, in literature as in life, are commonly anchored in places, landscapes, or buildings. As approaches to the study of culture, ecocriticism and cultural memory studies differ in their principal concerns: while the former relates to nature and space, and examines cultural constructions of the natural environment, the latter is oriented toward history and time, and principally preoccupied with representations and understandings of the social, in formulations relating the<br>

It is this latter, wider and socially relevant fact that, in this concluding chapter, I take up in greater depth. The discussion proceeds by way of something assumed throughout this book, namely,<br>

Part of the answer, said Morris, “is to be found in the fact that the criminal justice system exercises the greatest power that a state can legally use against its citizens.” Consequently, the treatment of convicted criminals discloses the functioning norms of human decency and fairness, the protections of citizenship, and the restraints on the exercise of force that pervade the<br>

For instance, Edward Casey’s comprehensive study of the philosophical history of place,The Fate of Place, gives precedence to place over space, suggesting that “to be at all—to exist in any way—is to be somewhere, and to be somewhere is to be in some kind of place” (ix). Because it is so central to our existence, place is often taken for granted and subsumed by the more dominant categories of space and time. The notion of space, Casey argues, is traditionally described as universal, infinite, and ubiquitous. Place,<br>

  Book Title: Religion after Religion-Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wasserstrom Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: By the end of World War II, religion appeared to be on the decline throughout the United States and Europe. Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7pds6">Religion after Religion</a><br>
  Abstract: A stumbling block often encountered by new readers of Mircea Eliade is the discovery that the History of Religions oddly is defined by its opposition to history. Gershom Scholem’s version of History of Religions seemed to obviate this dilemma, inasmuch as he championed historical research and the historical method. Henry Corbin used a variety of terms, such as “imaginal” and “prophetic,” to characterize his stridently antihistoricist Islamic studies. But all three shared a developed interest in metahistory. Both Scholem and Corbin thus spoke of “historiosophy.” They also spoke of their own work in terms of a kind of “counter-history.”¹ Corbin<br>

Scholem certainly wrote more directly on ethics than did his two friends.¹ But to the extent that he replaced, in effect,mitzvot(commandments) andHalakha(Jewish law) with “the dialectics of continuity and revolt” as the driving force of Jewish history, he may be said to have deethicized Judaism.² If, as I have tried to show in the preceding chapters, the aesthetic was far more fully developed than the<br>

A craft whose masters delight and move us with their elegance and fine workmanship? Yes, perhaps. But a few bold souls, ancient as well as modern, have it in mind that poetry will do something more for us. They suspect that the poets’ stories might say more than they appear to say, and that their language might be more than just words. Though these readers are likely<br>

  Abstract: Anthropology, my
                  fröhliche Wissenschaft, has been fatally involved over the whole course of its history (a long one, if you start it with Herodotus; rather short, if you start it with Tylor) with the vast variety of ways in which men and women have tried to live their lives. At some points, it has sought to deal with that variety by capturing it in some universalizing net of theory: evolutionary stages, pan-human ideas or practices, or transcendental forms (structures, archetypes, subterranean grammars). At others, it has stressed particularity, idiosyncrasy, incommensurability—cabbages and kings. But recently it has found itself faced<br>

  Abstract: One of the advantages of anthropology as a scholarly enterprise is that no one, including its practitioners, quite knows exactly what it is. People who watch baboons copulate, people who rewrite myths in algebraic formulas, people who dig up Pleistocene skeletons, people who work out decimal point correlations between toilet training practices and theories of disease, people who decode Maya hieroglyphics, and people who classify kinship systems into typologies in which our own comes out as “Eskimo” all call themselves anthropologists.

  Book Title: Essays on Giordano Bruno-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): GATTI HILARY<br>
  Abstract: The book is divided into sections that address three broad subjects: the relationship between Bruno and the new science, the history of his reception in English culture, and the principal characteristics of his natural philosophy. A final essay examines why this advocate of a "tranquil universal philosophy" ended up being burned at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition. While the essays take many different approaches, they are united by a number of assumptions: that, although well versed in magic, Bruno cannot be defined primarily as a Renaissance Magus; that his aim was to articulate a new philosophy of nature; and that his thought, while based on ancient and medieval sources, represented a radical rupture with the philosophical schools of the past, helping forge a path toward a new modernity.<br>

  Abstract: The study of giordano bruno’s copernicanism has a long and distinguished history, going back to the nineteenth century and continuing until the present day. It has involved a number of prestigious scholars, both historians of science and historians of philosophy, such as Paul-Henri Michel, Alexandre Koyré, Hélène Vedrine, Thomas Kuhn, and Robert Westman, among many others.¹ This notable body of comment on Bruno as one of the major Copernican philosophers of the sixteenth century will be taken as given, and mention will be made of the details of his reading of the

Bruno’s lifetime in the second half of the sixteenth century thus covers a vital if often turbulent moment of cultural transition, which would radically affect the history of both science and the humanities.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rn67">The Aesthetics of Mimesis</a><br>
  Abstract: Plato and mimesis form a fateful conjunction in the history of aesthetics. Not only was Plato the first Greek thinker to explore the idea of mimetic art in a theoretically extensive and probing manner, engaging strategically with themes and issues that, as we saw in my introduction, had been voiced in various but unsystematic ways in earlier Greek poetry and thought. He also took two momentous steps toward turning mimesis into the backdrop for an entire philosophy of art. The first was to pose certain fundamental challenges to the status and value of artistic mimesis—challenges that have remained unsettling<br>

  Abstract: In the domain of aesthetics, moving on from the writings of Plato and Aristotle to the rather patchily preserved evidence for Hellenistic attitudes to mimetic art is somewhat like descending from a mountain range into a large but indefinitely sprawling plain. It is appropriate to begin this journey, however, by observing that extensive areas of the plain are irrigated by waters that run down from the peaks above.

  Abstract: The concerns explored in Plato’s repeated dealings with mimesis set a large part of the agenda for the history of ancient aesthetics. Together with the countervailing views of Aristotle, which they themselves had helped to prompt, they became, in ways my two preceding chapters have allowed us to glimpse, a source of both stimulus and provocation that ran through the core of the mimeticist tradition. But not until late antiquity did anybody take up the topic of mimesis on the full scale of the Platonic precedent, restoring it to a position with relevance for the entire gamut of philosophical issues<br>

  Abstract: Despite, or perhaps in part because of, its importance and influence within the history of aesthetics, the current status of mimesis as a concept (or family of concepts) in the theory of art is contentious and unstable. In an age when talk of representation has become increasingly subject to both ideological and epistemological suspicion, mimesis is, for many philosophers and critics, little more than a broken column surviving from a long-dilapidated classical edifice, a sadly obsolete relic of former certainties. According to such convictions, even the Renaissance and neoclassical revival of mimeticism was a phase of thought whose structure of<br>

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

  Chapter Five  The Odd Triangle: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  Abstract: A recent spate of scholarly works on the history of reading and writing has focused on the distinction between oral and literate cultures, and on the prevalence (or absence) of literacy at various historical periods. To place early Christians in this discussion has proved a vexing question. An important contribution to this exchange is classicist William V. Harris’

  Author(s): Hatten Robert<br>
  Abstract: This theoretical innovation allows Monelle to describe how the Classical style of the eighteenth century--which he reads as a balance of lyric and progressive time--gave way to the Romantic need for emotional realism. He argues that irony and ambiguity subsequently eroded the domination of personal emotion in Western music as well as literature, killing the composer's subjectivity with that of the author. This leaves Dr. Strabismus suffering from the postmodern condition, and Raymond Monelle with an exciting, controversial new approach to understanding music and its history.<br>

  Abstract: Mahler’s music has been described as sui generis, unique in the history of Romanticism. It is “so very Mahler-like in every detail”, according to Aaron Copland. It is not at all Brahms-like or Tchaikovsky-like; it lacks the “great melodies”, those memorable tunes, focused by apodeictic signs, which dominate the symphonies of Mahler’s predecessors. Mahler’s melodies can be bombastic and vulgar, like the “Alma” theme in the Sixth Symphony, or jingling folk-tunes, like the main theme of the first movement of the First, taken from the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen; they can be veiled quotations from Beethoven and Schubert, from street-songs<br>

  Abstract: How can one grasp the nature and impact of Brahms’s musical language and communication in his own time? In the first instance one has to guard against an uncritical sense of the stability of musical texts, their meaning, and how they can be read and heard. The acoustic, cultural, and temporal habits of life of the late nineteenth century in which Brahms’s music functioned demand reconsideration if the listener in the early twentyfirst century wishes to gain a historical perspective on Brahms’s music and its significance. A biographical strategy and the history of critical reception themselves are insufficient.<br>

  Book Title: Performing Africa-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EBRON PAULLA A.<br>
  Abstract: Africa often enters the global imagination through news accounts of ethnic war, famine, and despotic political regimes. Those interested in countering such dystopic images--be they cultural nationalists in the African diaspora or connoisseurs of "global culture"--often found their representations of an emancipatory Africa on an enthusiasm for West African popular culture and performance arts. Based on extensive field research in The Gambia and focusing on the figure of the jali, Performing Africa interrogates these representations together with their cultural and political implications. It explores how Africa is produced, circulated, and consumed through performance and how encounters through performance create the place of Africa in the world. Innovative and discerning, Performing Africa is a provocative contribution to debates over cultural nationalism and the construction of identity and history in Africa and elsewhere.<br>

  Abstract: The words of the eighteenth-century German Romantic poet Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) resonate beyond the boundaries of their history and geography and are poignantly rearticulated by a contemporary master of the arts of memory. Salman Rushdie’s critical sentiment stands as a testimony to the labor of remembrance that reclaims the lost experience of another time and place in language and imagination. The work of commemoration is often the only means of releasing our (hi)stories from subjugation to official or institutionalized regimes of forgetting.

  Abstract: During the 1960s the structuralists had declared Sartre, as well as the paradigm of existential phenomenology he represented, obsolete, or “passé.” However, May 1968 signified a resounding vindication of Sartre’s doctrine of human freedom, for May demonstrated that “events” happened, that history was more than the opaque, frozen landscape the structuralists had made it out to be. Thereafter, Sartre’s concerted involvement with the Maoists—at one point, he served as the titular editor of no fewer than three Maoist publications (
                  La Cause du Peuple, J’Accuse, and Tout!)—catapulted him to the center stage of French political life. Since the May<br>

  Book Title: Through Other Continents-American Literature across Deep Time<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dimock Wai Chee<br>
  Abstract: Inspired by an unorthodox archive--ranging from epic traditions in Akkadian and Sanskrit to folk art, paintings by Veronese and Tiepolo, and the music of the Grateful Dead--Dimock constructs a long history of the world, a history she calls "deep time." The civilizations of Mesopotamia, India, Egypt, China, and West Africa, as well as Europe, leave their mark on American literature, which looks dramatically different when it is removed from a strictly national or English-language context. Key authors such as Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, Gary Snyder, Leslie Silko, Gloria Naylor, and Gerald Vizenor are transformed in this light. Emerson emerges as a translator of Islamic culture; Henry James's novels become long-distance kin to
         Gilgamesh; and Black English loses its ungrammaticalness when reclassified as a creole tongue, meshing the input from Africa, Europe, and the Americas.<br>

  Book Title: Charred Lullabies-Chapters in an Anthropography of Violence<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daniel E. Valentine<br>
  Abstract: How does an ethnographer write about violence? How can he make sense of violent acts, for himself and for his readers, without compromising its sheer excess and its meaning-defying core? How can he remain a scholarly observer when the country of his birth is engulfed by terror? These are some of the questions that engage Valentine Daniel in this exploration of life and death in contemporary Sri Lanka. In 1983 Daniel "walked into the ashes and mortal residue" of the violence that had occurred in his homeland. His planned project--the study of women's folk songs as ethnohistory--was immediately displaced by the responsibility that he felt had been given to him, by surviving family members and friends of victims, to recount beyond Sri Lanka what he had seen and heard there. Trained to do fieldwork by staying in one place and educated to look for coherence and meaning in human behavior, what does an anthropologist do when he is forced by circumstances to keep moving, searching for reasons he never finds? How does he write an ethnography (or an anthropography, to use the author's term) without transforming it into a pornography of violence? In avoiding fattening the anthropography into prurience, how does he avoid flattening it with theory? The ways in which Daniel grapples with these questions, and their answers, instill this groundbreaking book with a rare sense of passion, purpose, and intellect.<br>

To be sure, they soon came in for vigorous criticism themselves.

No one believes any longer that democracy can be reduced to a system of competitive elections culminating in majority rule. This is an important development. For two centuries the history of democracy was a history of polarization. It was as if the general will existed as a genuine force only when enshrined in a central government by way of an election. This notion was intimately associated with the conditions under which mankind had gained its freedom from the old ruling powers.<br>

  Abstract: This book is part history and part ethnography, and it includes a detailed account of everyday life in the treatment of Vietnam veterans with PTSD. To illustrate his points, Young presents a number of fascinating transcripts of the group therapy and diagnostic sessions that he observed firsthand over a period of two years. Through his comments and the transcripts themselves, the reader becomes familiar with the individual hospital personnel and clients and their struggle to make sense of life after a tragic war. One observes that everyone on the unit is heavily invested in the PTSD diagnosis: boundaries between therapist and patient are as unclear as were the distinctions between victim and victimizer in the jungles of Southeast Asia.<br>

Immediately upon hearing the query, I realized that I had framed the paper as a foreshortened version of a “history of the present” in which, quite consistently, one does not arrive at an analysis of the present per se.

  Abstract: As the twentieth century recedes into history, it is useful to reflect upon what may have been its most significant event: World War I. That conflict was a cultural and political watershed; it marked the beginning of Europe’s political and cultural decline and set in motion a chain of events that led to an even more destructive war. Without World War I we might have been spared the horrors of communism, Auschwitz, and the Cold War. Many historians nevertheless contend that World War I or something like it would have been all but impossible to avoid. The distinguished British historian,<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 5 revealed a strong correlation between worldviews and openness to contingency. Across diverse contexts, the more credence foreign policy experts, historians and international relations scholars place in the ability of laws and generalizations to describe the social world, the stronger their cognitive-stylistic preference for explanatory closure. In making judgments about contingency, they are more likely to be guided by what they believe to be valid laws and generalizations than information provided to them on a case-by-case basis. Experts with a preference for lawlike understandings of history tend to resist counterfactuals that “undo” events or outcomes on which their preferred<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t2zt">Touching the World</a><br>
  Abstract: THE SYSTEM of classification long in place in our libraries and bibliographies posits the kinship of autobiography and biography, ranging them both under the aegis of history as categories of the literature of reference, kinds of writing determined by their presumed basis in verifiable fact. Yet it is precisely with regard to this central identifying feature of reference to a world beyond the text that theory of autobiography today differs from the practice of biography. Thus it has become commonplace for students of autobiography to assert that the past, the ostensible primary reference of such texts, is a fiction. As<br>

  Abstract: IN PLACING so high an estimate in chapter 2 on autobiography as an indispensable, authoritative source of biographical insight, I may have seemed to subscribe to one of the sustaining myths of autobiography, belief in the possibility of self-determination. What—or how much—does an autobiographer really mean when he or she speaks of writing a life? The drive in writing lives toward an identity between story and the personal history that is its subject—“this is no book, / Who touches this touches a man”—is reflected in the ambiguous uses of the word

For better or worse, they function as the most familiar symbols of our collective experience. Wartime propaganda promotes this identification between the individual and society: to enlist is to enlist in history, to participate in a global movement of some kind. The pressure to make such identifications often leads noncombatants to an even livelier grasp of the dynamic at work than that of the veterans themselves. As Henry James<br>

  Abstract: This extraordinary book shows that curiosity about the unknown, the quest to understand foreign cultures, critical distance from one's own world, and the desire to remake the foreign into the familiar are not the monopoly of any single civilization or epoch. Euben demonstrates that the fluidity of identities, cultures, and borders associated with our postcolonial, globalized world has a long history--one shaped not only by Western power but also by an Islamic ethos of travel in search of knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: Favret examines wartime literature and art as varied as meditations on the
      Iliad, the history of meteorology, landscape painting in India, and popular poetry in newspapers and periodicals; she locates the embedded sense of war and dislocation in works ranging from Austen, Coleridge, and Wordsworth to Woolf, Stevens, and Sebald; and she contemplates how literature provides the public with methods for responding to violent calamities happening elsewhere. Bringing to light Romanticism's legacy in reflections on modern warfare, this book shows that war's absent presence affects home in deep and irrevocable ways.<br>

  Abstract: Poets of the late eighteenth century ask us to see in the snows of winter a history of warfare, with its anesthetizing threat to both history and writing. They conjure prospect poems where the view looks out upon total annihilation. Yet in their mining of the literary tradition and the resources of figuration, they disrupt that prospect, insisting that beneath and within the snow we recognize something still surviving. So much is written into the snow that these poems suggest the value of, indeed the need for a wartime rereading of that most romantic trope, the weather. To the precise<br>

The videotape of the beating—played and replayed on television screens for months—captures the “black and white” of the beating in a double sense.

On the one hand, a pressing urgency to reclaim and hold on to a newly reconstituted history of women has fueled the development of the field of women’s history as well as the archaeological, archival, and oral history activities of feminists in other areas of women’s studies outside the discipline of history, inside and outside the academy.

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: The collecting and exhibiting of natural objects and of artifacts has a long history. There are different kinds of collections, and they have varying origins, and serve a wide variety of different human purposes. Thus, for instance, in the ancient world temples sometimes served as repositories of various offerings, some of which were durable objects, such as the bloody armor of successively defeated opponents. The reasons the victors had for depositing these trophies are probably very complicated; the desire to thank a divine patron and commemorate a signal success may have played an important role, but also perhaps the desire<br>

  Book Title: Circles Disturbed-The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAZUR BARRY<br>
  Abstract: Circles Disturbedbrings together important thinkers in mathematics, history, and philosophy to explore the relationship between mathematics and narrative. The book's title recalls the last words of the great Greek mathematician Archimedes before he was slain by a Roman soldier--"Don't disturb my circles"--words that seem to refer to two radically different concerns: that of the practical person living in the concrete world of reality, and that of the theoretician lost in a world of abstraction. Stories and theorems are, in a sense, the natural languages of these two worlds--stories representing the way we act and interact, and theorems giving us pure thought, distilled from the hustle and bustle of reality. Yet, though the voices of stories and theorems seem totally different, they share profound connections and similarities.<br>

  Author(s) Mazur Barry<br>
  Abstract: The words “do not disturb my circles” are said to be Archimedes’ last before he was slain by a Roman soldier in the tumult of the pillaging of Syracuse. The timeless tranquil eternity of the not-to-be-disturbed circles in the midst of this account of hurly-burly and death is emblematic of the contrast between mathematics and stories: history, legends, anecdotes, and narratives of all sorts thrive on drama, on motion and confusion, while mathematics requires a clarity of thought that, in many instances, comes only after prolonged quiet reflection. At first glance, then, it might seem that mathematics and narrative have<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7tbz4">Circles Disturbed</a><br>
  Author(s) LA NAVE FEDERICA<br>
  Abstract: The story of a mathematical discovery is often presented as a linear succession of events corresponding to a series of logical steps leading up to the moment of discovery by proof. The discovery itself takes on the character of a “truth revelation.” Such an accounting is cathartic. It makes us feel good about ourselves; it gives us confidence in the power of our mind. But is a sequence of logical steps all there is behind proving something in mathematics? When telling a story, one naturally lapses into a linear mode. But when trying to locate the history of a discovery,<br>

  Abstract: It is hard to imagine a world without narrative: In our individual lives as well as in the history of humankind, narratives and storytelling are omnipresent. None of the other modes of symbolic communication “feels” as innately human as the synthetic sequencing of causally related events along a time line. In fact, as the French literary theorist and philosopher Paul Ricoeur argued in his seminal three-volume

  Author(s) Bradley Owen<br>
  Abstract: Joseph de Maistre’s “Eclaircissement sur les Sacrifices” (1810)² is an unjustly neglected work of a most unjustly neglected author. Written concurrently with his masterwork
                     Les Soirées de Saint-Pétersbourg,“Enlightenment on Sacrifices” provides a theoretical underpinning to Maistre’s notorious, often mysterious, and sometimes repellent reflections on punishment, war, the French Revolution, and the ways of Providence. The present essay outlines Maistre’s theory of sacrifice, describes how he applied it to historical events, processes, and institutions, and begins to explore the significance of Maistre’s theory for modern European intellectual history.<br>

  Abstract: Using the title of the first philosophical publication of René Descartes,

  Abstract: The idea of this research on the comparative history of new collectivities arose in the course of a previous extensive study on the Saguenay, an area of settlement situated in northern Quebec and opened to colonization in the 1830s. This study in social history aimed to reconstitute the (demographic, economic, cultural, etc.) features of rural French-Canadian society as it developed in those remote places, recently carved out of the bush (Bouchard 1996b). Given their typical isolation, it was reasonable to assume that these settlement communities exhibited such features in a rather magnified form. The results of my work were thus<br>

  Abstract: By drawing primarily on historiographical scholarship in Quebec, I intend to present some views on the role of comparison as a process of objectification in building historical knowledge. In very general terms, comparison refers here to any scientific approach which consists in: (1) relating two or several objects of analysis belonging to as many collective settings and (2) foregrounding differences and similarities so as to increase knowledge either of one or of each of these objects. I return to this later. My ideas are intended as a vindication of comparative history; there are, however, several ways to broach the argument.<br>

Like all new collectivities, Quebec had to ensure its survival and development on a continent yet to be discovered and tamed, alongside long established inhabitants, Aboriginal peoples with whom it invariably had to reckon. As elsewhere, the formation and transformations of the new collectivity occurred in a context of colonial dependency. In fact, in Quebec’s case, at least four types of dependency appeared simultaneously or successively between the seventeenth and the mid-twentieth centuries: political (France, Great Britain), religious (France, the Vatican),<br>

  Abstract: This essay in comparative history has led me to consider the collective imaginary as a social fact, the transformations of which are directly or indirectly linked to other social facts. In turn, the study of these changes themselves not only discloses the logic of discourse but also the social dynamic to which it belongs and of which it is an important driving force. In this sense, the cultural and social are two sides of a common history. I have chosen to give priority to the first because of the question that served as my point of departure: self-representations are constituted<br>

  Book Title: Sung Dynasty Uses of the I Ching-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wyatt Don J.<br>
  Abstract: The
         I Ching, or Book of Changes, has been one of the two or three most influential books in the Chinese canon. It has been used by people on all levels of society, both as a method of divination and as a source of essential ideas about the nature of heaven, earth, and humankind. During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Sung dynasty literati turned to it for guidance in their fundamental reworking of the classical traditions. This book explores how four leading thinkers--Su Shih, Shao Yung, Ch'eng I, and Chu Hsi--applied theI Chingto these projects. These four men used the Book of Changes in strikingly different ways. Yet each claimed to find in it a sure foundation for human values. Their work established not only new meanings for the text but also new models for governance and moral philosophy that would be debated throughout the next thousand years of Chinese intellectual history. By focusing on their uses of theI Ching, this study casts a unique light on the complex continuity-within-change and rich diversity of Sung culture.<br>

Sung dynasty thinkers laid the basis for later practices of moral philosophy, social organization, political theory and aesthetics.

  Abstract: However strongly we may see scientific ideas as socially and culturally contingent in their origin and expression, we must acknowledge that they are also the products of individuals. Hence even if we all consider scientific activity to be the reworking of prior scientific activity, the dynamics by which individual scientists develop their theories is a subject integral to the history of science. If we accept the proposition that knowledge grows by public and critical dialogue, we should not ignore the fact that important phases of the dialogue may occur within an individual.

  Abstract: There is a wealth of secondary literature on Darwin’s species concept, covering many different perspectives of the topic.¹ Of the various accounts available, I have always been particularly intrigued by Frank Sulloway’s suggestion that Darwin’s choice of species concept was guided by “tactical” considerations. Among those tactical considerations was the decision to employ his fellow naturalists’ species concept, in order to speak to them “in their own language” (Sulloway 1979, p. 37). Implicit in the suggestion is that Darwin was a member of a fairly clear-cut community of naturalists. In order to communicate with them about natural history, either to<br>

  Abstract: It is a fact familiar to all historians of science that Darwin was extremely slow to put his most important ideas into print.

Yet it was not until 1844 that he produced an essay that was suitable for publication by his family in the event of his death; and fourteen years later, the unexpected arrival of Wallace’s short paper “On the tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztvq7">Interpreting SAMSON AGONISTES</a><br>
  Abstract: The history of the Old Testament, of the formation of certain books into a canon, is, in part, the history of what happens when prophetic literature is invested with priestly understanding. Prophecy is lost in the appropriation, which is to say that the prophetic word loses its urgency and hence its bearing on the moment at hand; its relevance to the present is displaced by binding the text to the past, the future, or both. One set of questions involves; what did it mean for this particular set of books to become bound, and binding? under what conditions did their<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7ztvq7">Interpreting SAMSON AGONISTES</a><br>
  Abstract: The Samson story, it has been said, “demonstrates Israelite narrative art at its zenith.”¹ This claim should be made for the Book of Judges as a whole, for its meaning is located not in individual tales alone but spreads out through the entire structure. The salient features of this narrative are comprehended within the body of Renaissance exegesis but were not then the preoccupation they would become for later commentators. A prospect on history, a series of inset histories, another prospect on history that, this time, juxtaposes current actualities with earlier idealisms, the Book of Judges is also remarkable for<br>

  Abstract: It issometimes said that modern philosophy began with Descartes’ turn to subjectivity and to mathematical clarity as the model of truth. It is also said that modern philosophy began with Kant’s critique of traditional metaphysics and his critical amalgam of empirical and rationalistic factors in his epistemology as a “prolegomenon to any future metaphysics.” We have seen that, in any event, it was in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that conceptual specification of aesthetics and of religion emerged, as an aspect of the new critical philosophy and the enlarged senses of history and culture engendered by the Enlightenment<br>

  Abstract: “We have learned history and we claim that we must not forget it” (SNS 265, tr. 150). This is the most profound lesson that war taught French philosophy. Its violence exposed the hidden dependency of every way of life—economic, religious, artistic, philosophical—on a political sphere whose practices and disorders accumulate meaning almost imperceptibly over generations. If violence is not to rule public life, each domain must become aware of this dependency and alter itself to accommodate “history.” Even philosophers must learn to

  Abstract: The argument cannot be made that, having become liberal, Merleau-Ponty suddenly forgot what it meant to think politically. In
                  The Adventures of the Dialectiche repeats once again the litany of requirements that he places on truly political thought: it begins with a probabilistic reading of events, it needs a philosophy of history, it treats people statistically, it aims at success (AD 239, 9, 226, 251, tr. 163, 3, 154, 172). Chastising Sartre for his notion of “pure action,” Merleau-Ponty reminds him that political actors cannot use the fact that history is “overflowing with meaning” to justify an arbitrary perspective<br>

  Abstract: A convincing case for Merleau-Ponty’s importance to contemporary political theory could be made by documenting his direct impact on a variety of influential thinkers. Michel Foucault was his student at the Sorbonne and often used his teacher’s phenomenology as a foil in constructing his own archeology of the human sciences.¹ His inspiration is found in the social theories of Claude Lefort and Cornelius Castoriadis.² In the United States, a number of those interested in postbehavioral political inquiry gratefully acknowledge debts to Merleau-Ponty.³ And of course, Sartre’s understanding of history and class in the

  Abstract: No one in 1623 would have said that Shakespeare’s work marked and embodied some general change in European self-understanding. We often say so now. Portentous and wistful by turns, our talk about Shakespeare habitually sets him between times, last witness for the old, first prophet of the new, a genius of the divided vision and a symbol of our own life on the margins of tradition. Commonplaces can be false, of course, but the proof of this one is repetition, not only iteration of such judgments about Shakespeare’s place in history, but our constant recurrence to his texts, which have<br>

  Author(s) Suleiman Susan R.<br>
  Abstract: When raising the question of the reader’s status in the text, we may have in mind two sets of problems. According to one approach, the reader is thought of as an end conceived by the writer, whose work, accordingly, may be read in reference to the idea we have of that reader. A certain number of studies have enriched the history of literary criticism in this way, showing that the expectations of a particular public aimed at by the writer were determinative down to the most secret strata of the text (Jauss’s

  Abstract: When Elizabethan playwrights turned to their own history, they had no classical models to guide them and therefore no ascribed social expectations to meet in shaping their material. If Shakespeare was the first in this field, as he may well have been, he had to find a pattern of his own. The anonymous popular play,
                  The Famous Victories of Henry V, may have preceded theHenry VIplays, but if it did, Shakespeare eschewed it as a model, though he learned some important things from it, which he put to use when he wrote his own series of plays about<br>

  Abstract: Two comedies that Shakespeare wrote after
                  Henry Vshow the clear impression of what he had done in the history plays. These two areAll’s Well That Ends WellandMeasure for Measure, both of which have been recognized as “problem plays” since F. S. Boas called them that in the late nineteenth century.¹ To a large extent, their problems can be understood as an experiment in the dramaturgy of power. On one hand, Shakespeare more explicitly—one is tempted to say, more confidently—recalls the traditions of popular medieval religious drama in these two plays than he had done<br>

  Abstract: Apart from the history plays, for which no classical dramatic precedent existed, the young Shakespeare consistently turned to Roman drama for what he seemed to regard as acceptable models. In comedy, as Francis Meres noted, Shakespeare imitated Plautus, and in what was thought of as the much more demanding form of tragedy, he imitated Seneca.¹ To be sure, the influence of Seneca has been exaggerated, and few would venture to discuss it any longer as J. W. Cunliffe did in the late nineteenth century—as a tissue of quotations and motifs transplanted directly from Senecan tragedy into

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvb8n">Scripture, Canon and Commentary</a><br>
  Abstract: COMMENTARIES and commentarial modes of thinking dominated the intellectual history of most premodern civilizations, a fact often obscured by the “great ideas” approach to the history of thought and by modern scholars’ denigration of the works of mere exegetes and annotators. Until the seventeenth century in Europe, and even later in China, India, and the Near East, thought, especially within high intellectual traditions, was primarily exegetical in character and expression. As José Faur has observed, “The most peculiar aspect of the medieval thinker is that he developed his ideas around a text and expressed them as a commentary.”¹ Even those<br>

  Abstract: THE TRANSITION from commentarial forms and modes of discourse to modern scholarship and criticism is one of the most important in the intellectual history of mankind. Prior to the twentieth century, though, such a transition occurred in only three of the major traditions surveyed here: the biblical, the Homeric, and the Confucian (and in this last only incompletely). Despite the similarities in the commentarial assumptions and strategies employed in all the major traditions covered here, they parted ways in the speed and direction with which they entered (or made) the modern intellectual world. In at least two of these traditions,<br>

  Abstract: Every study has its fascination. The fascination of history is power. In one aspect, power is wielded over the outer world of human destinies, over the conditions and possibilities of life itself. Histories of politics and war are among the branches of inquiry devoted to this aspect. In another, power is represented in the inner world, where mind and heart imagine what they have sought in the physical world and what it has disclosed to them. Investigation into the inner world has unfolded into histories of religions, of ideas, and (not least) moralities, apart from many other forms.<br>

In this way, we have begun to recover some invisible “transitions” like those which John Scotus Eriugena considered as providing a hidden framing structure in some parables (see Preface, n. 2).

  Book Title: Neverending Stories-Toward a Critical Narratology<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tatar Maria<br>
  Abstract: In these compelling new essays, leading critics sharpen our understanding of the narrative structures that convey meaning in fiction, taking as their point of departure the narratological positions of Dorrit Cohn, Grard Genette, and Franz Stanzel. This collection demonstrates how narratology, with its attention to the modalities of presenting consciousness, offers a point of entry for scholars investigating the socio-cultural dimensions of literary representations. Drawing from a wide range of literary texts, the essays explore the borderline between fiction and history; explain how characters are constructed by both author and reader through the narration of consciousness; show how gender shapes narrative strategies ranging from the depiction of consciousness through intertextuality to the representation of the body; address issues of contingency in narrative; and present a debate on the crucial function of person in the literary text. The contributors are Stanley Corngold, Gail Finney, Kte Hamburger, Paul Michael Ltzeler, David Mickelsen, John Neubauer, Thomas Pavel, Jens Rieckmann, Shlomith Rimmon-Kenan, Judith Ryan, Franz Stanzel, Susan Suleiman, Maria Tatar, David Wellbery, and Larry Wolff.<br>

  Author(s) Pavel Thomas<br>
  Abstract: The distinction between history and fiction is once again stirring the interest of critics.¹ The question seemed settled in premodern times, when history was assumed to narrate the particular and poetry the general. True, until the nineteenth century, history was counted among the belles lettres, but that was a matter of stylistic kinship rather than of epistemological classification. Later, the practitioners of modern historiography became confident that their trade was more scientific than literary; therefore, the attempts to find new criteria for distinguishing history from poetry were welcomed. By then, fiction, or at least some of it, had ceased to<br>

  Book Title: Fabricating History-English Writers on the French Revolution<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Friedman Barton R.<br>
  Abstract: Barton Friedman demonstrates the ways in which English men of letters in the nineteenth century attempted to grasp the dynamics of history and to fashion order, however fragile, out of its apparent chaos. The authors he discusses--Blake, Scott, Hazlitt, Carlyle, Dickens, and Hardy--found in the French Revolution an event more compelling as a paradigm of history than their own "Glorious Revolution." To them the French Revolution seemed universally significant--a microcosm, in short. For these writers maintaining the distinction between "history" and "fiction" was less important than making sense of epochal historical events in symbolic terms. Their works on the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars occupy the boundary between history and fiction, and Fabricating History advances the current lively discussion of that boundary.<br>

  Abstract: Some years ago at a conference on history and narrative art, hosted by the University of Wisconsin English Department, I watched one of the few historians to have ventured into that den of (mostly) literary critics and philosophers of history berate the assemblage for repeatedly insisting on the kinship between historical narrative and fiction Actually, the argument in which this indignant historian became embroiled had been adumbrated by Northrop Frye, who observes, in an essay entitled “New Directions from Old,” that though historians’ narratives (like those of poets) incorporate “unifying forms,” or myths, “to tell a historian that what gives<br>

  Abstract: When John Keegan asserts that the rout of the Old Guard at Waterloo marks the real end of the French Revolution, he treats the scene as a novelist might. to epitomize the conflict by which the Revolution, having displaced the ancien regime, is ultimately subverted and the ancien regime itself restored—the process by which, as the Hardy of

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvs6h">Fictions in Autobiography</a><br>
  Abstract: Most readers naturally assume that all autobiographies are based on the verifiable facts of a life history, and it is this referential dimension, imperfectly understood, that has checked the development of a poetics of autobiography. Historians and social scientists attempt to isolate the factual content of autobiography from its narrative matrix, while literary critics, seeking to promote the appreciation of autobiography as an imaginative art, have been willing to treat such texts as though they were indistinguishable from novels. Autobiographers themselves, of course, are responsible for the problematical reception of their work, for they perform willy-nilly both as artists and<br>

  INTRODUCTION from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvsxn">Between Muslim and Jew</a><br>
  Abstract: The late Shlomo Dov (Fritz) Goitcin (1900–1985) characterized the central relationship of Jews with Muslims in the first centuries of Islam as one of “creative symbiosis.” This usage has been institutionalized in the study of Judeo-Arabica, and shows no immediate signs of being dislodged from its preeminence.¹ The concept
                  symbiosiswas first transposed from biology to the study of Jewish history by German Jewish intellectuals. Its most salient usage was in reference to their own cultural situation.² Alex Bein’s influential study, “Discourse on the Term ‘German-Jewish Symbiosis,’” appeared at that time, as an appendix to his essay (revealingly enough)<br>

  Abstract: The end of late antiquity is a period of Jewish history best known for being unknown. Salo Baron emphasizes the darkness of this terra incognita: “In the first three and one half dark and inarticulate centuries after the conclusion of the Talmud (500–850), Jewish intellectual leadership laid the foundations upon which the vocal and creative generations of the following three and one half centuries (850–1200) erected the magnificent structure of medieval Jewish biblical learning.”¹ S.

His Islam, to be sure, did end antiquity—and in so doing, initiated something epochally new.

  Abstract: The collapse of human structures, when subjected to unremitting natural forces, troubles Conrad’s imagination more than it does Hardy’s. Despite the bleakness of Hardy’s outlook—his view of life as an inherently unsanctioned process, an empty sequence of happenstances—he retained an enabling attachment (however complicated) to his native Dorset countryside. He absorbed its legends, its history, its customs, its landscape; and these absorptions may account for the modulated tone of even his darkest utterances. He is not surprised, his tone keeps repeating, because what is human history if not the immemorial story of expectation drained dry by time’s passage?<br>

  Abstract: For several years before he met Pound, Eliot was engaged in a rigorous philosophical examination of the nature of interpretation. Pound confronted many of the same issues in his attempts to include history in his poems, but Eliot was a trained philosopher, and he addressed these same issues more strenuously in his writings on Bradley. While he was a graduate student in the philosophy department at Harvard in 1913–1914, Eliot took Josiah Royce’s seminar in the Comparative Study of Various Types of Scientific Method.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zwn7">Barbarous Dissonance and Images of Voice in Milton's Epics</a><br>
  Abstract: This book examines the relative status and authority of the multiple narrative voices in
                  Paradise LostandParadise Regainedwithin interrelated socio-political, linguistic, and narratological contexts. Both epics accommodate a variety of interpretive voices, episodes, and dramatic and discursive exchanges that resist the monological containment of the poems’ dominant narratives. Through the inclusion of the multiple, even “unauthorized” voices and creation narratives, the poems are brought into a constructive tension with the Genesis story and its received biblical and literary traditions, as well as with accounts of England’s own tragic history. In presenting their individual creation stories, the narrators of both texts<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zwn7">Barbarous Dissonance and Images of Voice in Milton's Epics</a><br>
  Abstract: The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 led again to the suppression of public opinion, debate, and participation in political conversations. Disempowered and disillusioned by the turn of events, the remaining republicans sought alternatives to direct political involvement. A victim of the royalists’ return, Milton chose to compose an epic for the nation in which he recounted England’s tragic history and also proposed the establishment of a commonwealth to replace the “Empire tyrannous” (12.32) constructed by the monarchy.<br>

  Abstract: As a symbol for England traditionally reserved for celebratory purposes, the edenic garden was lost to the nation’s tragic history. Seventeenth-century writers, notably Andrew Marvell and Milton, appropriated and, more specifically, feminized Eden to represent the defeat of the nation in terms of the desecration of paradise.¹ The feminized garden is the site of political strife and cultural tensions; its openness and unruliness make it especially susceptible to exploitation.² “

In the interrelated socio-political, linguistic, and narratological contexts I have examined, voice reconfigures itself as the embodied reality to which subjects in conversation and debate lend their own voices. By extending my investigation to an analysis of Milton's revolutionary conception of history as conversation, I have demonstrated that the view of history as exemplary and challenging to life coincides with and anticipates what will hardly<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

  Abstract: There can be no doubt that literary history is and has been for several decades under a scrutiny so severe that only a thorough theoretical and epistemological re-examination can restore it to its place in literary scholarship, provided also that a renewed practice follows upon this re-examination. That the demand for it stems from the various “intrinsic” approaches to the study of literature is a well-known fact: Russian Formalism, the Prague Circle, New Criticism,
                  Nouvelle critique, as well as the structuralist and semiotic approaches have all tended to lead the literary scholar towards a close reading and analysis of the<br>

  Abstract: How compatible is the intellectual project of a comparative literary history with a postmodern culture? My title signals a potential contradiction from which comparative literary history may, or may not, emerge as still a creative and stimulating area within literary studies and the humanities at large. The contradiction arises if, embracing difference not only as a
                  fait accomplibut as a value sustaining of cultural identities, we set up the comparative viewpoint and activity as, somehow, its philosophical opposite, because of its inevitably universalizing frame of mind (or perhaps merely its universalizing image).

  Abstract: How does the postmodern literary historian make contact with the premodern world? Much present-day theorization regarding literary history (and quite relevant to history in general) begins with that question. I use the expression postmodern not as a philosophical or aesthetic label but by way of recognizing that we live in postmodernity, remembering that the status of this concept is itself problematic in that it resists being regarded as a period comparable to previous ones, sees itself more as a set of conditions of variable temporal dimensions, weakening and dissolving the very fabric of comfortable generalization.

  Abstract: To work in the humanities, particularly in early modern studies, forces upon us a double sense of time: on the one hand, all documents and monuments from even the most distant past, at least those that have been stored, preserved, printed, discovered, reclaimed, are at our disposal in a kind of eternal present, and we feel a kinship with all these creations of human imagination; on the other, when we attempt to make them our own, we very quickly discover the immensity of distance to be bridged and that, in order to exist in history, the phenomena of the past<br>

  Abstract: To this vast subject I shall not attempt to bring answers but merely to raise questions and to devise, only programmatically, a conceptual framework. Many of the recent findings of social history contradict certain admittedly naïve expectations regarding the accomplishments of the Renaissance. Simplistically one might say that there has been a gap between theoretical visions of the Renaissance and its practices. I suspect there is much more to be said, and that pursuing the discrepancies is a necessary part of rewriting and rereading the Renaissance so as to uproot, destabilize, complexify our images of Renaissance children both in concept<br>

In this case, if I were to write about the “influence” of China upon the early twentieth-century French poet Victor Segalen, or the image of China in his poetry, I would simply be contributing to the history of French literature the study of the poetic transformations of Segalen’s experiences of Chinese culture and travel in China.

As the ideological conflict of this tumultuous century abates, and parousiastic regimes¹ retreat, teeter and collapse, history offers the astonishing prospect of an underlying democratic movement taking the form of a constitutional dialectic.

  Abstract: Until recently Blake criticism has conferred a systematic coherence on his work through a canonical reading that contains the errancy of the early texts by making them experiments with or types of the later system.¹ The Bible, which Blake describes as the great code of art, has been the model by which both we and he have read his secular scripture. Assembled out of the writings of many men, and conjoining two cultures, it provides analogies not only for a unification of the authorial canon but also for a hermeneutics of cultural history that we may now recognize as imaginative<br>

Despite his personal acquaintance with Alberti and Leonardo, his knowledge of Vitruvius’s treatise, and his presence in important architectural contexts such as Urbino and Milan, mainstream architectural history has generally ignored his work. Pacioli’s plagiarism of Piero della Francesca’s work, as well as a lack of evidence that Pacioli’s contemporaries were interested in his book, have not contributed to challenge scholarly perceptions about the relative obscurity and marginality of his work.

  Abstract: THE BIBLICAL DESCRIPTION of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem has generated many diverse architectural speculations throughout our history. According to tradition, the Temple followed the designs of God and therefore could be interpreted as the archetypal work of architecture - a work that revealed a true order beyond the whimsical tastes of man and any temporal expressions of political power. In diverse times and cultures, mythical accounts of technological making and building demonstrated mankind’s keen awareness of the problems involved in transforming a given “sacred” world for the sake of survival. In the Christian tradition the Temple of Solomon<br>

Although Frye uses European existentialism and the Russian Revolution as examples of differing social structures and philosophies, the underlying comparison he draws throughout the essay is between Canada and the United States. Assuming Canada’s overriding mythology to be pastoral, Frye found it an easy step to emphasize that Canada, unlike the United States with its history of revolution and technological productivity, is<br>

But was Uriage during its heyday in fact the truly national institution its title implied? Who was studying and teaching there? What was their daily life, and their real relationship with the Vichy government? What was the actual agenda of Dunoyer de Segonzac and his staff — for example, with regard to Vichy’s youth movements, or toward modern women? How should history judge the Uriage experience?<br>

  Book Title: Karl Polanyi on Ethics and Economics-Foreword by Marguerite Mendell<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Baum Gregory<br>
  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  Book Title: Gender and Narrativity-  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): RUTLAND BARRY<br>
  Abstract: It is impossible to imagine a community that is not divided into at least two gender groups. It is equally impossible to imagine a community that does not tell or enact stories. The relationship between these universal aspects of human culture is the mainspring of Gender and Narrativity. From Genesis to Freud, the Western narrative tradition tells the same old story of masculine dominance/feminine subservience as a matter of divine will or natural truth. Here, nine Canadian scholars challenge and interpret this tradition, in effect "re-telling" the story of gender, and themselves intervening in the narrative process. Critical readings from a wide range of literary texts - medieval and modern, European and Canadian - replace abstract theory in these studies, while sociology, anthropology, psychoanalysis, deconstruction and new history are the axes of discussion. This book exemplifies the current range and diversity of Canadian critical writing.<br>

  Abstract: Academic postcolonialism has generally neglected to address the politics of reconciliation, despite the recent emergence of reconciliation political programs and movements in a wide range of national and international contexts. However, one obligation of postcolonial work is to “fully recognize” what Gyan Prakash refers to as “another history of agency and knowledge alive in the dead weight of the colonial past.”¹ This task of recognition necessitates understanding acts of anti-colonial dissent not only as theorizable but as fully productive, conceptually constructive theoretical “events” in their own right.

  Abstract: These statements by Paul Ricoeur, a French philosopher, and Joy Kogawa, a Canadian writer of fiction, might profoundly discomfit a postmodern academic audience familiar with the problems of humanism. Both thinkers express faith in the possibility of forgiveness at a time in history when such faith might seem naïvely optimistic and at worst dangerously self-deceptive. After all, the conceptual apparatus of forgiveness, to the extent that it involves recollection of and reflection on the past, is patently imbricated with notions of truth and memory; yet a virtual axiom of contemporary thought is that the latter are partial, fragmentary, and intensely<br>

  Abstract: I have been arguing that Munro’s fiction, with its emphasis on loss and on the importance of story-telling as a method of gaining knowledge of the past, reveals and enacts a poetics of elegy. Munro, like Gallant, insists that the past must be evaluated and re-evaluated and that memory — though not equivalent to truth — is the most important source of knowledge, of a necessarily fictional truth. Gallant’s characters often learn very little of the lessons she urges her readers to learn; we acquire insights about memory, history, truth, and writing by interpreting the ironic narrative stance employed in her fiction.<br>

  Abstract: In the history of Being presented by postmodernity, does Christianity represent a
                  chancefor rethinking Being and rewriting the meaning of the philosophical vocation? This seems to be one of the most meaningful demands put forth in the reflections of Gianni Vattimo, especially in the wake of his philosophical proposal that finds anouvertureunder debate in the metaphor of weak thought, in the sense that it radicalizes a form of reflection that is (seemingly) closer to deconstruction. The issue appears even more intriguing if it is limited to the relation between philosophy and religion. There is a well-known irreconcilability<br>

I use the wordAsianin italics inAsianfeminist theology to denote its contestable and stereotypical nature when people use the term in different types of Asian theological discourses. AsAsiacan never be regarded as a monolithic entity, it is misleading and even distorting to define in a monolithic way what constitutes Asia primarily as overwhelming poverty and multifaceted religiosity.

  Abstract: “Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you an accounting for the hope that is in you” (1 Pet. 3:15). Within this biblical charge, addressed to early Christian communities suffering religious persecution at the turn of the second century, we find a concentrated expression of a task that has persistently pressed itself upon Christian theology. What is that hope which would sustain Christian communities down through the centuries? How might theologians offer an account of that hope responsive to the distinct demands of their time?

  1  Metz's Response to Secularization: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t4j">Hope in Action</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter begins by examining Johann Baptist Metz’s early understanding of the modern process of secularization and his effort to present a positive interpretation of this process in light of Catholic theology. By tracing the manner in which Metz approached this task in his writing through 1966, we will see that it was through engaging the process of secularization that a distinctive eschatology emerged in his theological program. His transcendental-linear theology of history presented a productive apologetic resource, allowing him to affirm the ongoing validity of Christianity for those who experienced the process of secularization as a threat to their<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0t4j">Hope in Action</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 1, we saw that Metz’s eschatological project developed out of his theological analysis of the modern process of secularization, was unduly limited by his transcendental-linear theology of history, and gradually emerged as a practical-critical hope for the future. Now, turning to Edward Schillebeeckx’s efforts to address the apologetic consequences of secularization during the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, we will trace similar developments that unfold over significantly different terrain; Schillebeeckx offered a distinctive response to the same historical challenges, yet during this period the doctrine of eschatology also would move to the center of his theological project.<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 3, we watched as Schillebeeckx worked to identify a critical and productive orientation for the Christian’s hope. It was out of this interest that his massive christological project, the story of the eschatological prophet, emerged. It was also within the context of this project that Schillebeeckx once again engaged the Christian claim that Jesus has universal significance for all of human history, considered in chapter 2. In returning to this claim in the 1970s, however, Schillebeeckx would directly confront the questions of whether and how we can speak of the universal significance of any human person and whether<br>

  Book Title: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference-A Contribution to Feminist Systematic Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): McRandal Janice<br>
  Abstract: Christian Doctrine and the Grammar of Difference argues that the most potent and resourceful theological response to the challenging questions of gender and difference is to be found in a retrieval of a doctrinal framework for feminist theology. In particular, it is suggested that a doctrinal narrative of creation, fall, and redemption—underpinned by the doctrinal grammar of the Trinity—provides resources to resolve the theological impasse of difference in contemporary feminist theology. The divine economy reveals a God who enters into history and destabilizes fixed binaries and oppressive categories. The biblical narrative discloses a subtle yet potent fluidity to the Triune relationships. As created subjects—precisely in our difference—we are sustained, affirmed, and drawn back into the Triune life. The subtleties of divine transgression are already recognized in the patterns of the liturgy, in prayer, and in practices of contemplation. Here, bodies not only encounter the transgressive love of God but are enabled to inhabit their differentiated humanity with distinctiveness and grace. The grammar of Christian faith cannot ultimately be uncovered except in prayer, opened beyond itself to a source of life and giving.<br>

  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, various themes arose to prominence within the mind of the church. Some surfaced from within, by the natural process of maturation and development, while others resulted from sharp reminders given by a rapidly changing secular world. Among these, perhaps the most significant, and that because its influence was so far-reaching, was the awakening to a sense of history.¹ This questioned fundamentally the prevailing certainties of knowledge, and had the potential to transform the intellectual disciplines completely. To become aware of historicity is to acknowledge a sense of contingency, pluralism, and the possibility of change. Much that<br>

Displacing the early modern Enlightenment thinkers, Scotus serves as the inaugurator of all that is ill with modernity.

  Abstract: Radical Orthodox theologians have affirmed the place of narrative in contemporary theological reflection and discourse, along with its significance for accurately conceptualizing the development of the history of theology. Theology, that is
                  theo-logos, cannot be separated from the telling of stories, which is an axiom that I believe has been reaffirmed in the preceding chapters, and remains a principle of Radical Orthodoxy to which I am deeply sympathetic. However, there is a problem here. It is not whether or not one engages in a narrative mode to explore and express deeper insights about God and creation, but the problem concerns<br>

  Book Title: Consider Leviathan-Narratives of Nature and the Self in Job<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Doak Brian R.<br>
  Abstract: Theologians and philosophers are turning again to questions of the meaning, or non-meaning, of the natural world for human self-understanding. Brian R. Doak observes that the book of Job, more than any other book in the Bible, uses metaphors drawn from the natural world, especially of plants and animals, as raw material for thinking about human suffering. Doak argues that Job should be viewed as an anthropological “ground zero” for the traumatic definition of the post-exilic human self in ancient Israel. Furthermore, the battered shape of the Joban experience should provide a starting point for reconfiguring our thinking about “natural theology” as a category of intellectual history in the ancient world. Doak examines how the development of the human subject is portrayed in the biblical text in either radical continuity or discontinuity with plants and animals. Consider Leviathan explores the text at the intersection of anthropology, theology, and ecology, opening up new possibilities for charting the view of nature in the Hebrew Bible.<br>

  Abstract: This paper explores the prospects of a proactive approach to historical thinking in relation to the paradox of human difference and interdependence in a global context. The dual premise of my analysis is the reality and permanence of cultural (including religious) diversity of human societies, on the one hand, and the imperatives of peaceful and cooperative co-existence in an increasingly globalized environment, on the other. Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

Thus, the dynamics and the heterogeneity inherent in the writing of history merit emphasis at the outset of this chapter, if only because it is sometimes assumed that history-writing has taken a common approach so far. The initial points I make are, first, that the domain of history has not really ever been rigidly defined. It is not only since Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre effectively broke down some of its time-honored but artificial barriers that history has become open-ended; the two patriarchs of what is<br>

  Abstract: To be found at the interstices of the current academic literatures on the relation between history and memory, on the nature and sources of modern political violence, and on the problem of totalitarianism is an idiosyncratic series of questions that has the effect of making the thought of Hannah Arendt acutely relevant. One of these questions—or, at least, the broad question that I have in mind—concerns how the historical experiences of imperialism, Nazism, and Stalinism might be both understood and situated
                     vis-à-visone another, and how their status and relation might be clarified.<br>

  Abstract: What sort of a book is
                  The Origins of Totalitarianism?One of Arendt’s strongest defenders, Seyla Benhabib, writes that it is too “systematically ambitious and over-interpreted” to be strictly history, “too anecdotal, narrative and ideographic” for social science, and is “too philosophical” for political journalism.¹ In this chapter I will argue that the work is not only, as others have argued, an act of storytelling, but also an attempt to reframe the stories we tell. I use the word “reframe” precisely because of its Heideggerian echoes. As Arendt’s extraordinarily abstruse fable “Heidegger the Fox” suggests and as much scholarship has<br>

  Chapter 12  Hannah Arendt and the Old “New Science” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcjrb">Hannah Arendt and the Uses of History</a><br>
  Author(s) Maloney Steven Douglas<br>
  Abstract: Hannah Arendt’s political writings are frequently analyzed through the lenses of her German-Jewish identity or her tutelage under
                  existenzphilosophers like Martin Heidegger or Karl Jaspers. This approach has been useful in understanding much of what Arendt was trying to offer in her writings, but it also restricts our understanding of Arendt in very significant ways. Too much focus on Arendt’s direct influences (teachers, identity, place in history) has created an environment where academic work on Arendt has tried to dig into every possible historical clue it can to “come to terms” with her thought, in the same way that<br>

  Book Title: Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries-Cultural Meanings, Social Practices<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Paletschek Sylvia<br>
  Abstract: Popular presentations of history have recently been discovered as a new field of research, and even though interest in it has been growing noticeably very little has been published on this topic. This volume is one of the first to open up this new area of historical research, introducing some of the work that has emerged in Germany over the past few years. While mainly focusing on Germany (though not exclusively), the authors analyze different forms of popular historiographies and popular presentations of history since 1800 and the interrelation between popular and academic historiography, exploring in particular popular histories in different media and popular historiography as part of memory culture.<br>

  Author(s) Paletschek Sylvia<br>
  Abstract: At this point in time, popular presentations of history are booming – not only in the Western world, but worldwide. Recent allusions to history as the ‘new gardening’ by a BBC representative¹ or its characterization as the ‘new cooking’ by historian Justin Champion (2008a) suggest that in Britain history-related television programmes are on their way to outdoing the highly successful gardening or cooking formats in terms of popularity. While this may be a slight exaggeration, the fact is that there has been a rising interest in history since the 1980s. From the second half of the 1990s this interest has<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qck1n">Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries</a><br>
  Author(s) Epple Angelika<br>
  Abstract: Edward Gibbon, David Hume, Jules Michelet and Leopold von Ranke are all well-known and important historians from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who earned fame for their role in the making of modern historiography. They were all men, however. Did women of that period write history? Of course they did, but they solely wrote popular historiography. Women across Europe lacked access to scholarly training until the beginning of the twentieth century. Consequently one cannot find any academic history written by a woman that would belong to the traditional canon of European historiography of that time. This picture alters, however, if<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qck1n">Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries</a><br>
  Author(s) Paletschek Sylvia<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth century has many names: the century of the bourgeoisie, the century of nations, the century of industrialization, and the century of natural science and technology.¹ However, it might just as well be called the century of history. From the late eighteenth century on, the engagement with the past, and particularly with ‘patriotic’ history (
                  vaterländischer Geschichte), was an important means of shaping individual and collective identity. After the collapse of theAlte Reich(the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation) in 1803–1806, and following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the German states in their new patchwork<br>

  Abstract: Why were so many people at that time interested in the history of the world? What factors caused this boom and what did this particular upsurge signify? What kind of stories do these universal histories tell and what do these reveal about Wilhelmine society? What are the functions of these popular historiographies?

  Author(s) Hardtwig Wolfgang<br>
  Abstract: When addressing the public, the academic discipline of history has recently been facing unprecedented competition. Television broadcasts and series have been presenting the history of Nazi and post-war Germany in a manner appealing to a broader audience. Motion pictures tell stories from the Third Reich, the air raids and post-war life. Documentaries are in great demand. They offer an attractive combination of solid research, eyewitness interviews, a moving soundtrack and contemporary photographs and filmstrips (Benz 1986; Knopp and Quandt 1988; Bösch 1999: 204–18). As demonstrated by Steven Spielberg’s

  Author(s) Classen Christoph<br>
  Abstract: From today’s viewpoint it might not seem an obvious choice to include an essay on East German radio in a volume on popular historiography. There is currently a boom in history, and contemporary history in particular, on TV, in museums and exhibitions and lately on the internet. If we take this as a starting point, then we can assume it to be a phenomenon of the last thirty years. That means, of course, that the German Democratic Republic (GDR), or East Germany as it is also known, was only touched by this boom in its last decade. Even more important<br>

  8  Memory History and the Standardization of History from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qck1n">Popular Historiographies in the 19th and 20th Centuries</a><br>
  Author(s) Langewiesche Dieter<br>
  Abstract: ‘Memory history’ (
                  Erinnerungsgeschichte) is found at the start of every process of historical transmission.¹ As a theoretically grounded approach in the methodological arsenal of historical studies, however, it is a relatively new branch of historical inquiry, albeit one that is rapidly growing. The catastrophic experiences of the first half of the twentieth century contributed considerably to this. They created, according to Dan Diner in his European-oriented, universalhistorical attempt to understand this period, a separate ‘time of remembrance’, whose ‘negative telos’ overlaid other experiences and taught us to view history differently (Diner 2000: 17). The remembrance of this period, together with<br>

  Author(s) ROBERTS MARY LOUISE<br>
  Abstract: Does female celebrity in the nineteenth century warrant our particular attention? Does it differ significantly from male celebrity or can it be deemed impervious to gender norms? In
                  The Frenzy of Renown, Leo Braudy left such questions aside, focusing his history of fame mostly on men. Though he never denies that societies could celebrate women, he does not examine what happens when they do. It is this question that interests the historian Lenard Berlanstein, who argues that celebrated women, and actresses in particular, evoked more attention than did their male counterparts. Because celebrity in the nineteenth century was defined as<br>

  Author(s) SILVER KENNETH E.<br>
  Abstract: After Queen Victoria, Sarah Bernhardt (1844–1923) was probably the most celebrated woman of the nineteenth century and certainly the most famous Frenchwoman. Apart from the drawing power of her obvious talent (the opinions of her theatrical detractors notwithstanding), Bernhardt’s colossal celebrity was dependent upon and inextricably bound up with French prestige: its ancient and recent history, its real and imagined travails. The extent to which Bernhardt and France were the Gemini twins of the

  Abstract: Just as the role of subjectivity in language is attracting increasing attention from an array of disciplines ranging across linguistics, communication, anthropology, history, philosophy, and others, the thrust of this interest appears to be headed in the opposite direction from an agenda that would place rhetoric at center stage. Rhetoric in its conventional guise has been deemed a quintessentially public enterprise, oriented to the marketplace of propositions projected to appeal to others. In the market square of civil discourse, sellers of ideas invite prospective buyers to critically test the proffered wares for plausibility and persuasiveness. In contrast, subjectivity as popularly<br>

  Abstract: In 1908, the most popular play on Broadway was Israel Zangwill’s “The Melting Pot.” This play portrayed America as a place where different ethnicities are mixed into one kind of “American person,” and when one considers the time period, one understands the source of the play’s popularity. Between the late 1800s and early 1900s, America welcomed more immigrants to its shores than at any other period in its history. As the nation incorporated the new groups, artists and writers responded in ways to help the nation address the changing character and identity of the country. To the present day, the<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book is to examine the concept and the practice of stardom in the France of the 1950s and 1960s,¹ a period of French history that saw dramatic economic, social and cultural change. Our premise is that the ‘stars’ of a given historical period or moment capture their era for us in a range of ways: that the preoccupations, values, conflicts and contradictions of a particular culture, its ‘climate of feeling’, are vividly expressed through its celebrities. Stardom may be read as a symbolic portal into the nature of a culture, stars as that culture’s ultimate expression.<br>

  Author(s) Brunner José<br>
  Abstract: Undoubtedly, the relevance of a psychoanalytic dimension in historical understanding correlates with the importance that is attributed to anxiety and fantasy in history. In circumstances in which historical agents—both groups and individuals—conduct themselves in what seems to observers and commentators to be a rational manner, the contribution of anxiety and fantasy to their conduct is usually taken to be negligible. Only when rational explanations are no longer considered sufficient will affects such as anxiety or unconscious fantasies play a major role in an historical analysis.<br>

  Abstract: The issue of human nature, what it is to be human, has been the central enterprise of an ‘anthropological’ science – nominally, at least – since Immanuel Kant’s (1996) first, modern formulation of the disciplinary endeavour in the late 1700s. At the same time it has been argued that in ‘human nature’ anthropology conjures with a concept compromised beyond redemption by its essentialistic, hierarchical and exclusionary history: its role in an imperialism of male over female, adult over child, advanced over primitive, Occidental over Oriental, rational over emotional, and conscientious over brutish, as representative of the essentially human.

  Book Title: Godless Intellectuals?-The Intellectual Pursuit of the Sacred Reinvented<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Riley Alexander Tristan<br>
  Abstract: The Durkheimians have traditionally been understood as positivist, secular thinkers, fully within the Enlightenment project of limitless reason and progress. In a radical revision of this view, this book persuasively argues that the core members of the Durkheimian circle (Durkheim himself, Marcel Mauss, Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) are significantly more complicated than this. Through his extensive analysis of large volumes of correspondence as well as historical and macro-sociological mappings of the intellectual and social worlds in which the Durkheimian project emerged, the author shows the Durkheimian project to have constituted a quasi-religious quest in ways much deeper than most interpreters have thought. Their fascination, both personal and intellectual, with the sacred is the basis on which the author reconstructs some important components of modern French intellectual history, connecting Durkheimian thought to key representatives of French poststructuralism and postmodernism: Bataille, Foucault, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Deleuze.<br>

  1  The Intellectual Pursuit of the Sacred from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qcrr1">Godless Intellectuals?</a><br>
  Abstract: The central goal of this book is to map the emergence, trajectory, and influence of a very particular kind of intellectual project that I call
                  mystic Durkheimianism, which unites two seemingly very strange bedfellows: Durkheimian sociology and poststructuralism. An understanding of its existence and influence in the French intellectual world will contribute to a better understanding of some otherwise fairly mysterious facts in intellectual history. Moreover, there are to date no treatments of this important piece of the history of French social theory by a sociologist using sociological terms and tools, and I hope to contribute to the work of<br>

  Book Title: The French Road Movie-Space, Mobility, Identity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Archer Neil<br>
  Abstract: The traditionally American genre of the road movie has been explored and reconfigured in the French context since the later 1960s. Comparative in its approach, this book studies the inter-relationship between American and French culture and cinemas, and in the process considers and challenges histories of the road movie. It combines film history with film theory methodologies, analysing transformations in social, political and film-industrial contexts alongside changing perspectives on the meaning and possibilities of film. At once chronological and thematic in structure,
      The French Road Movieprovides in each chapter a comprehensive introduction to key themes emerging from the genre in the French context - liberty, identity and citizenship, masculinity, femininity, border-crossing - followed by detailed, innovative and often revisionist readings of the chosen films. Through these readings the author justifies the place of the road genre within French cinema histories and reinvigorates this often neglected and misunderstood area of study.<br>

  Abstract: Although not a professional historian, the author raises several issues pertinent to the state of history today. Qualifying the 'non-historian' as an 'able' interventionist in historical studies, the author explores the relationship between history and theory within the current epistemological configurations and refigurations. He asks how history transcends the obsessive 'linguistic' turn, which has been hegemonizing literary/discourse analysis, and focuses greater attention on historical experience and where history stands in relation to our understanding of ethics, religion and the current state of global politics that underlines the manipulation and abuse of history.<br>

  Abstract: ‘History does not exist’, writes Susan Crane, ‘apart from our thinking it. Clearly, there are as many ways of experiencing history as there are histories to experience’.¹ Such an experience and understanding of history, however, was never a part of my growing up; history books meant an immersion in drudgery, a laborious saunter down a thick slush of facts and a wrestle with the imminent prospect of comeuppance in the event of forgetting some details while writing tests.

  CHAPTER 1  Romancing the Past: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qd1wz">A Lover's Quarrel with the Past</a><br>
  Abstract: Romancing history is a projection of sympathy and indulgence into a past age; history in its invocation of the past is a ‘museum of held reverberations’⁴; this can lead to excesses, transgressions, instabilities summoning up a delicate consortment of imbalances between the past and the present. It is a poeticisation of the past, a kind of sin that ‘imbalances’ generate, a sin that ‘imagination’ promotes, a sin that spurts a creative gush. Ann Rigney, in her delight of a book

  Abstract: The fantasy, faith, fanaticism and furore over several cases involving the ‘romance’ and ‘representation’ of history drive the historian into the eye of the storm and, unavoidably, beg an interrogation into the politics of writing history, the ethics of reading and the impact that multiple discourses ranging across several disciplinary domains and contemporary existential aggravations can engineer on a historian’s
                  commitmentto his discipline. Doing history is inflected by the deeply invested milieu in which a historian finds him-or herself continually exposed to a farrago of conflicting propositions and positions. This gives rise to the need to grow a distinct<br>

Beyond the specificity of each society, history, and religion, when a catastrophe strikes, people seem to draw on the same repertory of actions. For centuries, we have shared a common political activism in the form of demonstrations and strikes (Tilly 1986). But the public culture of disaster seems different for<br>

  Book Title: Culture and Rhetoric-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Tyler Stephen<br>
  Abstract: While some scholars have said that there is no such thing as culture and have urged to abandon the concept altogether, the contributors to this volume overcome this impasse by understanding cultures and their representations for what they ultimately are - rhetorical constructs. These senior, international scholars explore the complex relationships between culture and rhetoric arguing that just as rhetoric is founded in culture, culture is founded in rhetoric. This intersection constitutes the central theme of the first part of the book, while the second is dedicated to the study of figuration as a common ground of rhetoric and anthropology. The book offers a compelling range of theoretical reflections, historical vistas, and empirical investigations, which aim to show how people talk themselves and others into particular modalities of thought and action, and how rhetoric and culture, in this way, are co-emergent. It thus turns a new page in the history of academic discourse by bringing two disciplines - anthropology and rhetoric - together in a way that has never been done before.<br>

  Abstract: Rhetoric Culture theory has its roots in a long history, and in what follows I present some of the ideas that scholars—mainly rhetoricians, but also some philosophers—have developed over the centuries in order to grasp the difficult and complex relationship between rhetoric, culture, and humanity. Throughout, I have given priority to the voices of the precursors of Rhetoric Culture theory and have kept my own interpretation and comments to a minimum. At the end, I recall the work of scholars who were among the first to empirically study the constitutive role of rhetoric in non-European cultures.<br>

  Abstract: Few episodes in the postwar history of Czechoslovakia have received greater attention than the Prague Spring, when reformers in the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KSČ) attempted to create a democratic socialism in the heart of the Soviet bloc, creating unprecedented opportunities for political liberalization, social mobilization, and internationalism in a Stalinist regime that had previously been one of the most conservative in Eastern Europe. The subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops contributed to the commemoration of the Prague Spring as a national rebellion against Soviet hegemony, a myth that Czech and Slovak historians have been laboring to confront since<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Eriksonas Linas<br>
  Abstract: This chapter opens with an invitation to consider two phenomena: history and genre. Most of the contributions to this volume take genre as a static element in the universe of historical enquiry. They see genre mostly as a prescriptive form that through its narrativity lends meaning and engenders common traits to a corpus of texts – textual or visual – claimed to be of the same

  Chapter 13  ‘People’s History’ in North America: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Seixas Peter<br>
  Abstract: The protean notion of ‘people’s history’ has multiple meanings in North American culture. It can refer to a narrative whose subject is ‘the people’, i.e. the masses – in contrast to political, economic and social elites – and thus carry a relatively explicit oppositional ideological orientation. It carries this message in Howard Zinn’s
                  A People’s History of the United States as well as in the Radical History Review(1981) section entitled ‘Towards a People’s History’ in an issue on ‘Presenting the Past: History and the Public’.¹ The Review also used ‘people’s history’ as that which could appeal to a broad audience (as<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdcbq">Narrating the Nation</a><br>
  Author(s) Lim Jie-Hyun<br>
  Abstract: Modern historiography has often been a tool to legitimate the nation-state ‘objectively and scientifically’. Despite its proclamation of objectivity and scientific inquiry, modern historiography has promoted the political project of constructing national history. Its underlying logic was to find the course of historical development that led to the nation-state. Thus, national history has made the nation-state both the subject and the object of its own discipline. The ‘Prussian school’ provides a typical example. Not only was Ranke the official historiographer of the Prussian state, Droysen’s distinction between ‘History’ (
                  die Geschichte) and ‘private transactions’ (Geschäfte) also reveals the hidden politics that<br>

  Chapter 3  Institutionalizing an Extended Youth Phase in Chinese Society: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qddtx">Young Men in Uncertain Times</a><br>
  Author(s) Pan Tianshu<br>
  Abstract: Throughout most of Chinese history, males—and especially sons—have comprised the preferred social category in which parents strove to develop emotional and ethical obligation. This relationship has constituted the fundamental value orientation by which Chinese society has traditionally organized itself. But the 1949 communist transformation of society, especially urban life, profoundly altered the parent-son dyad, and in its place the parent-daughter bond became increasingly paramount. Even in the countryside, where the parent-son relationship and the patrilineal principle remained sociological constants, a transformation took place by the late twentieth century. Increasingly, urbanites and some rural residents (Shi 2009; Yan 2003)<br>

  Book Title: Conflicted Memories-Europeanizing Contemporary Histories<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Ramsbrock Annelie<br>
  Abstract: Despite the growing interest in general European history, the European dimension is surprisingly absent from the writing of contemporary history. In most countries, the historiography on the 20th century continues to be dominated by national perspectives. Although there is cross-national work on specific topics such as occupation or resistance, transnational conceptions and narratives of contemporary European history have yet to be worked out. This volume focuses on the development of a shared conception of recent European history that will be required as an underpinning for further economic and political integration so as to make lasting cooperation on the old continent possible. It tries to overcome the traditional national framing that ironically persists just at a time when organized efforts to transform Europe from an object of debate to an actual subject have some chance of succeeding in making it into a polity in its own right.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Lindenberger Thomas<br>
  Abstract: In the soapbox speeches of politicians, references to Europe have until recently functioned as an institutionalized appeal to overcome the nationstate. Intellectuals like the political scientist Jerzy Mackow have lent weight to this notion by calling for a ‘European idea’—which he aptly calls ‘Europeanism’—analogous to the development of nationalism during the nineteenth century. In order to build a common identity on the basis of history beyond ‘a bunch of national narratives and legends,’ he argues ‘the Europeans need to learn and understand European history.’¹ Even the past chairman of the Association of German Historians Johannes Fried warns that<br>

  Chapter 1  History of Memory, Policies of the Past: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Rousso Henry<br>
  Abstract: According to common sense both within and beyond the boundaries of Europe, we more or less take for granted the existence of a European ‘culture’ or ‘civilization.’ In spite of geopolitical uncertainties, divergent points of view, and ideological discrepancies, this topos is firmly anchored in the collective imagination, even though it frequently gives rise to misunderstandings. Even the most chauvinistic of historians subscribe to this idea, out of either conviction or convenience. Moreover, several works have been written in recent years about the history of European institutions or organizations, and about the economic, social, and cultural history of European countries<br>

  Chapter 3  Writing National Histories in Europe: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Berger Stefan<br>
  Abstract: The rise of national identity discourses in Europe accompanied the growing professionalization and institutionalization of history writing in the nineteenth century. Consequently national history writing became, for about one century between 1850 and 1950, the dominant form of history writing across Europe. Of course, national history had been written long before the nineteenth century. Thus we can trace histories of England, for example, to medieval times.¹ And of course, national history continued to be a popular genre after the 1950s, in big nation-states as much as in smaller and reemerging or nascent nation states. National histories thus possess a long<br>

  Chapter 4  Between Europe and the Nation: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Lagrou Pieter<br>
  Abstract: As we all know, French contemporary history followed a very peculiar path. From 1789 until at least 1945, the French nation was deeply divided over the implications of the founding event of French contemporary history, the Revolution.¹ From Robespierre to Napoleon III, Captain Dreyfus, Charles Maurras, Léon Blum, and Philippe Pétain, the cleavage over the legacy of the revolution—
                  les guerres franco-françaises—provides again and again the interpretational framework needed to understand French history. Not that 1945 was the end of it: the momentous changes of 1958, 1968, and 1981 served each time to underscore how, in some inscrutably French<br>

  Chapter 5  War and Conflict in Contemporary European History, 1914–2004 from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Horne John<br>
  Abstract: The first half of the twentieth century was the most violent period in modern European history. War, revolution, civil war, and the deliberate displacement or destruction of entire ethnic and cultural communities characterized much of the continent from 1914 to the early 1950s. Thereafter, conflict was frozen in less lethal and more institutionalized forms until the final decade of the century, when the end of the Cold War was followed by the extraordinarily peaceful integration of Europe—a process that continues today. The exception has been the violent implosion of Yugoslavia.<br>

  Author(s) Patel Kiran Klaus<br>
  Abstract: At first sight, any discussion about the need for a Europeanized perspective on Nazism seems to be superfluous. It is obvious that the Third Reich and the years leading up to it embrace events of European and even of world historical importance. Without the First World War and the Great Depression—two turning points not only in German, but also in European and even global history—the Nazis’ rise to power would have been quite improbable. At least as of 1933, Europe was eagerly observing developments within Germany that culminated in the most important and radical form of European fascism.<br>

  Author(s) Steiner André<br>
  Abstract: The Europeanization of economic life is not a new phenomenon in recent history. Traders have consistently been connected throughout the various parts of Europe, and the emergence of the modern nation-state did not bring transnational economic activities to an end. The first multinationals emerged in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century, and their economic importance further increased in the twentieth century. But the attempt to create a transnational economic area with supranational institutions was successful for the first time only after the Second World War. Western European integration began as an economic process with the Marshall Plan,<br>

  Author(s) Appelqvist Örjan<br>
  Abstract: It is all too easy for historians to allow the Cold War division process of 1947–1948 to retroactively overshadow the tentative character of the apprehensions, projects, and choices guiding different political actors during the postwar planning period that spanned from the final phase of the Second World War and the immediate transition to conditions of peace. It is all too easy to forget the weight of history felt by European postwar planners at that time, realized primarily as fear: of a repetition of the economic chaos after the First World War, and of renewed German aspirations to avenge and<br>

  Book Title: The Great Tradition and Its Legacy-The Evolution of Dramatic and Musical Theater in Austria and Central Europe<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rudolph Richard L.<br>
  Abstract: Both dramatic and musical theater are part of the tradition that has made Austria - especially Vienna - and the old Habsburg lands synonymous with high culture in Central Europe. Many works, often controversial originally but now considered as classics, are still performed regularly in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, or Krakow. This volume not only offers an excellent overview of the theatrical history of the region, it is also an innovative, cross-disciplinary attempt to analyse the inner workings and dynamics of theater through a discussion of the interplay between society, the audience, and performing artists.<br>

  Abstract: When talking about
                     Heldenplatz, one cannot deny that Thomas Bernhard’s insults against Austria on stage produced the biggest theater scandal in the history of the second republic.¹ But if we concentrate our exclusive attention on the scandal, we give the play an unequivocal nature that it does not have, and we do not give justice to the intellectual work(Geistesarbeit)of the author.<br>

  Chapter 9  Pulling the Pants off History: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdgfh">The Great Tradition and Its Legacy</a><br>
  Author(s) Malkin Jeanette R.<br>
  Abstract: One of Thomas Bernhard’s most historically specific plays,
                  Vor dem Ruhestand(Eve of Retirement, 1979) is also one of his most ritualistic. A play of “doubleness” and unsynthesizable tensions, it is both realistic and metaphoric, structured both causally and cyclically. Steeped in public history, it simultaneously ritualizes history through private memory. This doubleness—the coexistence of historical and ahistorical consciousness, of development and stasis, time and timelessness—is, no doubt, central to Bernhard’s work as a whole; and it is knowingly, indeed pointedly used by Bernhard in this play to both reflect and implicate the history and memory of his<br>

In the context of a reference work, a twenty-nine page article is fairly lengthy, yet the article is minuscule in comparison to the numerous separate articles on the musicians and music associated with that city.¹ Even if we were to restrict our comments to Vienna alone, the richness and complexity of that city’s contribution to the world of music could fill a library; a book length treatment could hardly do it justice.

  Author(s) Saunders Barbara<br>
  Abstract: One feature¹ of a museum is the performative naturalisation of ‘objective’ relations between a state² and ‘its’ culture or master narrative of descent, through changing, and sometimes deceptively diffuse and decentralised means (Duncan and Wallach 1980, Hooper Greenhill 1992).³ A museum’s task is to construct a shifting multiplicity of tableaux vivants as facets or dimensions of the state.⁴ The Israel Museum in Jerusalem is exemplary:⁵ science and evolution validate the narrative of descent and warrant the cultural-historical blue-print.

  Book Title: Between Educationalization and Appropriation-Selected Writings on the History of Modern Educational Systems<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vervenne Marc<br>
  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: It is not easy, within the limited space of this introduction, to paint a sufficiently finely-differentiated picture of the story of education. Nevertheless, we shall venture to do that in the guidebook for this museum. The idea we should like to emphasize is the central role played by the school in the modernisation of society. Given the broad reach of that process, we shall not adopt an exclusively Belgian or Flemish standpoint, and foreign visitors will have no difficulty in finding, both in the museum itself and in this museum guide, similarities with the history of education in their own<br>

  Abstract: In the prologue to John L. Rury’s book,

Female Schooling and the Division of Labor in Urban America, 1870–1930, published in 1991, Barbara Finkelstein writes: “The history of education is not rich in studies that combine an effusion of quantitative data, with equal portions of narrative elegance, biographical perspective, and attention to intellectual and spiritual as well as material dimensions.Education and Women’s Workis such a book.”¹ This affirmation is somewhat frustrating for the Belgian investigation into this topic.<br>

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: The long list of questions issued by the organizers of this seminar is, we assume, primarily heuristic in intent. Rather than formulating a response to them all, therefore, we have concentrated on a single theme. It takes its relevance from the point of view of the discipline in which we as researchers have profiled ourselves, namely educational historiography. This contemporary variant of what was previously often termed “the history of pedagogy” still may be institutionally associated with the “educational sciences” but does not necessarily coincide with it as part of fundamental research².

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: Every scientific discipline – including the history of education – is continuously subject to change. This truism applies both to the knowledge generated within a particular field of research and to its didactic translation into a teaching subject. When the subject of
                  histoire de la pédagogieentered the curriculum of Belgian university teacher training in 1890, the legislators had completely different objectives and content in mind than the ones we proclaim today (Depaepe, 1997a). That we ourselves no longer speak of “historical pedagogy” but of “educational historiography” (or “history of education”)¹ manifests this. The preference for educational history over pedagogy<br>

  Abstract: For history researchers, it is not a needless luxury to consider from time to time the content and the significance of the basic concepts they use, certainly if they have the ambition to interpret and/or explain history in addition to purely describing it. This self-reflection, compelled by the annually recurring dialogue with educational philosophers (cf. Smeyers & Depaepe, 2006),² need not necessarily place an emphasis on philosophical abstraction but can just as well start from an examination of the history of one’s own research. Such an approach need not succumb to navel-gazing. Instead, such historical self-reflection possibly points to the creeping<br>

  9  Belgian Images of the Psycho-Pedagogical Potential of the Congolese during the Colonial Era, 1908–1960 from:

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: It would be unfortunate if ISCHE, the international organization for the history of education, did not heed the colonial experience. Not only is this theme of research international by definition, it is also clearly an educational phenomenon of the first order: by means of education, the intention was to “convert” and to “civilize” the autochthons, which, willingly or unwillingly, was accompanied by the imposition of a number of elements of the “Western” way of life and thought.¹<br>

  Author(s) Depaepe M.<br>
  Abstract: In a previous study the author and his co-author compared the educational project in the Belgian Congo (1908-1960) with a runaway locomotive that, in spite of all the good intentions, drove to self-destruction (Depaepe & Van Rompaey, 1995:225). What did we intend by use of this image taken from Emile Zola’s novel
                  La bête humaine(1890)? Rather than wanting to breathe new life into the stereotypical, often leftist-revisionist coloured discourse of the ‘missionary as an accomplice to a cohort that was out for economic profit’ (Rodney, 1976), we found that colonial educational historiography, more sharply still than Western educational history, exposes<br>

  Abstract: “My life in the history of education” – to borrow the title of a recent British series of scholarly autobiographies¹ – began with a lively interest in educational practice. I became interested in the organization of the subject-based grade-school system and wished to find its origins.

  Abstract: The title question, which was submitted to us by the guest editorial team of
                  Studies in Philosophy and Education, obviously has a high normative content. At first sight, that is rather remarkable, because the question about how it should be done contrasts sharply with the blurred norms that are prevalent in postmodern society, as well as with the plurality of opinions and views that are consciously cultivated there. Perhaps it is because in the field of the history of education, there are no longer any “eminent examples”¹ that the question is put explicitly? There too, a diversity of approaches prevails.<br>

  Author(s) Simon F.<br>
  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education? In our opinion, the history of education, if it wants to be valid, must in any event bear the stamp of what Michel de Certeau once called the<br>

  Author(s) HEN Yitzhak<br>
  Abstract: The age of Pippin III (d. 768) and Charlemagne (d. 814) was a significant period of liturgical formation in the early medieval West. For the first time in the history of western Christendom a concerted interest in liturgy was demonstrated by rulers who obviously recognised the political and social advantages that lay within the patronage of liturgy.¹ Several unrelated sources clearly associate Pippin III with the introduction of the
                  cantus Romanusinto Francia, and consequently credit him with replacing thecantus Gallicanuswith what were understood to be Roman musical traditions.² Walahfrid Strabo (d. 849) even recounts that it was<br>

  Author(s) Beeckman Tinneke<br>
  Abstract: In what way can Freudian psychoanalysis help contribute to a naturalist, yet non-reductionist anthropology? Such an anthropology would be one that takes into account the significance of the natural history of the human species for our understanding of the human being, but without reducing the specificity of the human to processes of natural or sexual selection. The question of reductionism is all the more relevant today given that naturalism has become a major paradigm in contemporary philosophy. Simply put, naturalism’s basic tenet is that human beings are genealogically related to each other and have common ancestors with other species. Nevertheless,<br>

  Abstract: South Africa’s history of colonisation and apartheid included discriminatory laws, policies and practices based on factors including race, sex, gender, culture and religion. the goal was to create a system of legal, social and economic separation of the people of the country. Since 1994, post-apartheid South Africa is a country where many diverse people coexist in harmony, despite differences based on culture, race, religion etc. the Constitution of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 (hereinafter the Constitution) is viewed by many as an ideal model for multicultural democratic contexts, wherein the right to equality exists with the right to culture,<br>

  Abstract: The proper balance between moral pluralism and community is, I believe, a pervasive interpretive issue in American constitutional law in the constitutional jurisprudence of state neutrality required by the religion clauses, free speech, and constitutional privacy.

  Abstract: The history of fantasy in the realm of children’s literature has been one of forceful contradictions: on the one hand, fantasy is criticized as being fraudulent, irrational, and overly imaginative; on the other, it is criticized for being formulaic, escapist, and not imaginative enough. The seeds of this debate lie in early uses of the word, which seem to have little to do with literature per se, but nevertheless powerfully influenced the activity of imagination over centuries. Fantasy’s potency in relation to children’s literature reflects its potency in relation to literature in general: it takes us into the heart of<br>

  Author(s) Reid-Walsh Jacqueline<br>
  Abstract: According to the
                  Oxford English Dictionary(OED), “girlhood” has been in use from the mid-eighteenth century until the present day as both a singular and a plural noun. From the first cited use—notably, in Samuel Richardson’sClarissa(1747–48), a novel concerning the paragon of virtuous adolescent girlhood—the term “girlhood” has had a history as an ideologically loaded term in Western culture. As the following brief definitions indicate, several meanings overlap: “The state of being a girl; the time of life during which one is a girl. Also: girls collectively.” Its different denotations and connotations make for a<br>

  Author(s) Mallan Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The word “queer” is a slippery one; its etymology is uncertain, and academic and popular usage attributes conflicting meanings to the word. By the mid-nineteenth century, “queer” was used as a pejorative term for a (male) homosexual. This negative connotation continues when it becomes a term for homophobic abuse. In recent years, “queer” has taken on additional uses: as an all-encompassing term for culturally marginalized sexualities—gay, lesbian, bi, trans, and intersex (GLBTI)—and as a theoretical strategy for deconstructing the binary oppositions that govern identity formation. Tracing its history, the

  Abstract: A term with a variety of charged meanings and purposes, “race” arose in English in the sixteenth century from the French “race” and the Italian “razza” and has been employed as a means of grouping individuals by ethnic, social, or national background. While the term has been applied generally to a range of collective identities— including the “human race” (Williams 1976) or the “German race” (Murji 2005)—at present the term invokes categorization attached to imagined physical similarities or to a group’s own sense of collective ideals and history. “Race” as a term points both backward toward injurious histories of<br>

  Author(s) Crago Hugh<br>
  Abstract: Historically, “story” is probably one of the most frequently employed words in relation to children’s literature. Yet despite its constant use by reviewers and critics over much of the history of fiction written specifically for young people, it has rarely been defined or analyzed. In its apparent simplicity, taken-for-grantedness, and resistance to deconstruction, the term establishes itself as something unquestioned, like the nature of “childhood” or “the child” itself. “Story” is missing from the index of numerous works where one might reasonably expect to find it—such as Katherine Nelson’s

  Book Title: Transcendent in America-Hindu-Inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Williamson Lola<br>
  Abstract: Yoga, karma, meditation, guru - these terms, once obscure, are now a part of the American lexicon. Combining Hinduism with Western concepts and values, a new hybrid form of religion has developed in the United States over the past century. In Transcendent in America, Lola Williamson traces the history of various Hindu-inspired movements in America, and argues that together they constitute a discrete category of religious practice, a distinct and identifiable form of new religion.Williamson provides an overview of the emergence of these movements through examining exchanges between Indian Hindus and American intellectuals such as Thomas Jefferson and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and illuminates how Protestant traditions of inner experience paved the way for Hindu-style movements' acceptance in the West.Williamson focuses on three movements - Self-Realization Fellowship, Transcendental Meditation, and Siddha Yoga - as representative of the larger of phenomenon of Hindu-inspired meditation movements. She provides a window into the beliefs and practices of followers of these movements by offering concrete examples from their words and experiences that shed light on their world view, lifestyle, and relationship with their gurus. Drawing on scholarly research, numerous interviews, and decades of personal experience with Hindu-style practices, Williamson makes a convincing case that Hindu-inspired meditation movements are distinct from both immigrant Hinduism and other forms of Asian-influenced or New Age groups.<br>

  Book Title: Jewish Concepts of Scripture-A Comparative Introduction<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sommer Benjamin D.<br>
  Abstract: What do Jews think scripture is? How do the People of the Book conceive of the Book of Books? In what ways is it authoritative? Who has the right to interpret it? Is it divinely or humanly written? And have Jews always thought about the Bible in the same way? In seventeen cohesive and rigorously researched essays, this volume traces the way some of the most important Jewish thinkers throughout history have addressed these questions from the rabbinic era through the medieval Islamic world to modern Jewish scholarship. They address why different Jewish thinkers, writers, and communities have turned to the Bible - and what they expect to get from it. Ultimately, argues editor Benjamin D. Sommer, in understanding the ways Jews construct scripture, we begin to understand the ways Jews construct themselves.<br>

  Abstract: For most contemporary Jews, the “Jewish Bible” is a single volume containing the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, which is readily available and accessible through the process of reading. While totally familiar to us, these paired phenomena—the Bible as a book and reading as the primary means of accessing it—are relatively new developments in the history of Jewish encounters with scripture. Until the onset of printing, most Jews would never have encountered a “Bible.” They might have encountered a Torah scroll in the synagogue or scrolls or volumes containing selections from other parts of the canon.

  Book Title: The Disarticulate-Language, Disability, and the Narratives of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Berger James<br>
  Abstract: Language is integral to our social being. But what is the status of those who stand outside of language? The mentally disabled, wild children, people with autism and other neurological disorders, as well as animals, infants, angels, and artificial intelligences, have all engaged with language from a position at its borders. In the intricate verbal constructions of modern literature, the 'disarticulate' - those at the edges of language - have, paradoxically, played essential, defining roles.Drawing on the disarticulate figures in modern fictional works such asBilly Budd, The Sound and the Fury, Nightwood, White Noise,andThe Echo Maker,among others, James Berger shows in this intellectually bracing study how these characters mark sites at which aesthetic, philosophical, ethical, political, medical, and scientific discourses converge. It is also the place of the greatest ethical tension, as society confronts the needs and desires of the least of its brothers. Berger argues that the disarticulate is that which is unaccountable in the discourses of modernity and thus stands as an alternative to the prevailing social order. Using literary history and theory, as well as disability and trauma theory, he examines how these disarticulate figures reveal modernity's anxieties in terms of how it constructs its others.<br>

  Book Title: 22 Ideas to Fix the World-Conversations with the World's Foremost Thinkers<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sakwa Richard<br>
  Abstract: The aftershocks of the 2008 financial crisis still reverberate throughout the globe. Markets are down, unemployment is up, and nations from Greece to Ireland find their very infrastructure on the brink of collapse. There is also a crisis in the management of global affairs, with the institutions of global governance challenged as never before, accompanied by conflicts ranging from Syria, to Iran, to Mali. Domestically, the bases for democratic legitimacy, social sustainability, and environmental adaptability are also changing. In this unique volume from the World Public Forum Dialogue of Civilizations and the Social Science Research Council, some of the world's greatest minds - from Nobel Prize winners to long-time activists - explore what the prolonged instability of the so-called Great Recession means for our traditional understanding of how governments can and should function. Through interviews that are sure to spark lively debate,22 Ideas to Fix the Worldpresents both analysis of past geopolitical events and possible solutions and predictions for the future.The book surveys issues relevant to the U.S., Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Speaking from a variety of perspectives, including economic, social, developmental, and political, the discussions here increase our understanding of what's wrong with the world and how to get it right. Interviewees explore topics like the Arab Spring, the influence of international financial organizations, the possibilities for the growth of democracy, the acceleration of global warming, and how to develop enforceable standards for market and social regulation. These inspiring exchanges from some of our most sophisticated thinkers on world policy are honest, brief, and easily understood, presenting thought-provoking ideas in a clear and accessible manner that cuts through the academic jargon that too often obscures more than it reveals.22 Ideas to Fix the Worldis living history in the finest sense - a lasting chronicle of the state of the global community today.Interviews with: Zygmunt Bauman, Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan, Craig Calhoun, Ha-Joon Chang, Fred Dallmayr, Mike Davis, Bob Deacon, Kemal Dervis, Jiemian Yang, Peter J.

He argues that other areas of economics have developed theories, such as behavioral economics and new paradigms of monetary economics, which can serve as building blocks for a new framework. Two areas that were not well-addressed in the standard paradigm and need to be addressed in new economic thinking are sustainability and inequality.<br>

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Stanton wrote this daring, breathtaking overview of women’s history before this was a subject in which scholars worked. Imagining women as important actors shaping the destiny of humanity was an act of faith, necessary for her to challenge historians to approach their work with an enlarged understanding of how societies advanced. She had to review books across a variety of fields to cull any references to women’s contributions in previous societies. Stanton’s methodology suggests her sympathy for new positivist trends in history that were concerned with reconstructing patterns of everyday life rather than narrating the stories of kings,<br>

  ONE  Unpacking biographical narratives: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qgpjg">Biography and turning points in Europe and America</a><br>
  Author(s) Kupferberg Feiwel<br>
  Abstract: The concerns of sociologists when engaging in biography research are different from both the caring professions and oral history. Although there are clear parallels between, in particular, oral history and sociological biography research concerning methodological issues related to how to conduct and interpret biographical interviews (Charlton et al, 2007; Perks and Thomson, 2009), there are also important theoretical and conceptual differences. The latter originate from the knowledge interest of sociologists that partly coincide with but are nevertheless slightly different from historians. This can be illustrated by the works of Alessandro Portelli (1981, 1991, 2003). What mostly interests Portelli is how<br>

  Abstract: In his compelling history of the invention of social work in the US, Leslie Margolin describes the importance for the project of state sanctioned social work of constructing the poor as passive and nonreflexive in sharp contrast to the presumed agency and reflexive awareness of the better off. We have shown that this process of ‘othering’ remains central to the current settlement in child protection work. Indeed, it is enjoying a vibrant renaissance.<br>

  The Community that Raymond Brown Left Behind: from:

  Author(s) Anderson Paul N.<br>
  Abstract: Among the paradigm-making contributions in Johannine studies over the last half century, one of the most significant is the sketching of “the community of the Beloved Disciple” by Raymond E. Brown (1979). Extending beyond Johannine studies, Brown’s (1984) work on the history of early Christianity and “the churches the apostles left behind” is also among the most practical and interesting of his forty-seven books.² Here, Brown’s analysis of the unity and diversity of early Christian approaches to leadership and community organization³ have extensive implications, not only for historical and sociological understandings of the first-century Christian movement, but also for approaches<br>

  Author(s) Culpepper R. Alan<br>
  Abstract: In 1975 Rudolf Schnackenburg (1992, 34) observed that “the question of the relationship between [the Gospel of John] and 1 John was much discussed in the past, but today it has lost its interest.” In recent decades, the issue of the relationship between the Gospel and the Epistles has been tied to the history of the Johannine community, and the Epistles have been interpreted as a response to dissension over the interpretation of the Gospel. Judith Lieu has challenged the prevailing approach, offering an alternative reading of the Epistles as more pastoral than polemical and independent of the Gospel, drawing<br>

  Abstract: Within the American guild of biblical scholars, Latina/o biblical interpretation is commonly described as an “emerging hermeneutics.” Conversely, this description suggests that the interpretation of the Bible by Latina/o scholars is new and, in turn, insignificant to the history of the biblical tradition in North America. Indeed, the Latina/o cultural archive reminds us that the history of biblical interpretation in the American hemisphere points back to the centuries after 1492 and the colonial enterprise of the Spanish Empire.<br>

  Abstract: The primary aim of this chapter is to provide an introduction to twentieth-century Catalan avant-garde movements and groups through a history of visual poetry. This has the advantage both of widening recognition of experimental aesthetic practices beyond Catalonia’s most famous names – Salvador Dalí (1904–89), Joan Miró (1893–1983) and Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926) – and of situating their work within the unique and complex fabric of contemporary Catalan culture.

  Abstract: After the amnesia of the immediate aftermath of decolonisation, France’s overseas empire has become, in recent decades, an object of study amongst French academics, as well as a more accepted part of public discourse.¹ Whilst debates on the nature and legacies of French colonial rule in both scholarly and popular spheres remain contentious, France’s imperial ventures are now firmly part of the nation’s history. Yet, whilst France’s empire may be part of the historical record and, as such, part of our memory of the French past, the same cannot be said for the spaces beyond France’s traditional spheres of colonial<br>

  Abstract: The legacy of empire lies quietly under the surface, ready to manifest itself in contemporary French culture, including its literary institution. The history and evolution of one of its minor components, the Société des romanciers et auteurs coloniaux français, reflect the spirit of the times that witnessed its successive incarnations: the rash certainties of conquest, their inglorious loss, the uneasy mix of nostalgia and amnesia, the enduring determination to maintain central influence over an ill-defined periphery.¹<br>

  Abstract: The events and actors of the Algerian war hold an ambiguous place in recent French history, particularly given the way in which the war was actively erased from national memory soon after Algerian independence.¹ However, since the early 1990s, narratives of the war have re-emerged in France, taking complex and often conflicting positions which have escalated to the level of ‘memory wars’.² The contrast between the recent, violent return of Algerian war memories and the long preceding period of societal amnesia has meant that the persistent memories of the metropolitan French populace generated during the conflict are often overlooked.

  Abstract: The inevitable media attention surrounding the fiftieth anniversary of Algerian independence resurrected the ghosts of a conflict that many would have preferred to lay to rest. For a time the carefully managed official commemorations replaced the silence which habitually covers one of the most painful episodes in France’s recent history, highlighting the contradictions which characterise the nation’s attitude towards this period. This chapter seeks to tease out some of these conflicts, arguing that the events of 1962 continue to resonate within France because they function as a nexus of continuity and rupture, one which marked a moment of watershed for<br>

  3  The Emergence of Humphreys as a Postcolonial Writer from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qhf1h">Emyr Humphreys</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter is concerned with Humphreys’s early fiction: the first six novels published between 1946 and 1957 and particularly the seventh,
                  A Toy Epic, which was finally published in 1958. The main postcolonial strategies that Humphreys has used throughout his career emerged and were refined during this period: the use of Wales as the location of the plot, the use of Welsh history and myth, the discussion of the variety of Welsh life. The focus of the discussion will be on the ways in which these techniques evolved and the reasons behind their use – the extent to which those reasons<br>

  Abstract: Outside the House of Baalbuilds on Humphreys’s achievement inA Toy Epicand is certainly the single text in which he best achieves his aims as a novelist-cum-Welsh nationalist. Whereas ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence will in its seven volumes cover a greater stretch of Welsh history and chart its effect on a wider range of characters, this single novel’s scope is both more specifically focused and in literary terms more adventurous.

                  The Anchor Tree(1980),Jones(1984),Unconditional Surrender(1996) andThe Gift of a Daughter(1998). In both groups there is deliberate intention on the part of the author to utilize Welsh history, whether by using ‘textbook’ or anecdotal sources, his own memory of events and their repercussions in Wales during the twentieth century or, indeed, by using the history of other nations as a commentary on the Welsh situation.

Using very different techniques, Humphreys is concerned, no less in the independent novels than in his ‘The Land of the Living’ sequence, both to express the importance of its history to Welsh society and to instruct his reader about that history. After writing

  Abstract: British history is apocalyptic history, and Welsh literature refects this. The island of Britain was – in one tradition – revealed as a Promised Land in a visionary dream to its founder, and human sovereignty was assured on the defeat of the giant Gogmagog, when the island was given it6s name.¹ Prophecy and apocalypse go hand in hand in this foundation legend, and such apocalypse is refigured repeatedly in the literature as the legendary (and perhaps mythical)² sovereignty of Britain is lost and relost, A constant backdrop,³ it takes centre stage in many of the most monumental works, most famously in the<br>

Given that there has been no developed study of the rhetoric¹ of Welsh literature, to answer such questions fully would require a far more detailed study of Welsh historiography than the current limited selection of codices and texts.² Such a question does indeed call for a full-scale study of representation in medieval Welsh literature. Predictably, I may make no claim to comprehensiveness as I outline a few ways of reading and interpreting the<br>

The crux here is the extent to which history itself which history itself (or a species of history) comes to an end with the return of the son of prophecy. That is, does the temportality of prophyecy, in its collapse of present, past and future, necessarity imply a theological reading or a<br>

  Book Title: Externalism-Putting Mind and World Back Together Again<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Rowlands Mark<br>
  Abstract: The externalist conception of the mind was one of the most significant developments in the philosophy of mind in the second half of the twentieth century. Despite its central importance, however, most recent work on externalism has been very technical, often making the basic ideas and principles difficult for students to grasp. As well, comparatively little work has been done to situate externalism in the history of philosophy, in either analytic and continental traditions. Mark Rowlands remedies both these problems, presenting a clear and accessible introduction to externalism that is grounded in wider developments in the history of philosophy. Rowlands discusses Sartre's radical reversal of idealism and the Husserlian views that prompted it; Wittgenstein's attack on the assimilation of meaning and understanding to an inner process; Putnam's and Burge's thought experiments and the externalism about content to which those experiments gave rise; the scope and limits of content externalism; and the extension of externalism to consciousness.<br>

  Abstract: In Tuberculosis Then and Now leading scholars and new researchers in the field reflect on the changing medical, social, and cultural understanding of the disease and engage in a wider debate about the role of narrative in the social history of medicine and how it informs current debates and issues surrounding the treatment of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. Through a case study of the history of tuberculosis and its treatment, this collection examines medicine and health care from the perspectives of class, race, and gender, providing a challenging and refreshing addition to the field of bacteria-centred accounts of the history of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: There have been major changes in how historians have approached the writing of the history of tuberculosis over the past thirty years and multiple ways in which the topic is currently addressed.

  Abstract: This essay makes a speculative proposal: by using an approach to tuberculosis that focuses on the storied nature of lay understandings of disease, it may be possible to gain a broad grasp of its place in the culture of the past. It is a contribution to the strand within medical history that seeks to move beyond the social historical towards the cultural historical in an attempt to make an account of the past that places the experience of disease and medicine proportionally as an aspect of life and not its whole.

  Author(s) BASHFORD ALISON<br>
  Abstract: The historiography of modern nationalism has recently taken a distinct turn. A number of studies have shown how the public health management of populations through medico-legal border control has actively constituted national identities. And many of these studies have persuasively demonstrated the close connections between communicable-disease prevention, race-based exclusions and restrictions, and the formation of racialised nations.¹ Australian history is exemplary in this respect, in large part because of the stridency and efficacy of the white Australia policy. Initially implemented in each of the Australasian colonies in the late nineteenth century, the national Immigration Restriction Act (1901) was one version<br>

  Abstract: The critique of modernism that so preoccupies contemporary architectural discourse has entailed a fundamental re-interpretation of the history of Western architecture. The critique and the re-interpretation together have led to the discovery that architecture, initially and throughout most of its history, was understood as anything but a functional or formalist undertaking. It was found that until very recently,
                  allarchitecture - not only (albeit especially) that of church or temple buildings - was essentially religious, inasmuch as it confounded the immanent and the transcendent in built, corporeal reality.

  Abstract: Judaism and Christianity meet in scripture, which they share and about which they contend. In Common Ground Father Andrew Greeley and Rabbi Jacob Neusner present their characteristically candid - and often provocative - interpretations of the history, context, and meaning of scripture. Written in alternating chapters, Common Ground reveals how a rabbi understands Christ, Mary, and St Paul, and how a priest views creation, Abraham and Sarah, and the prophets. Neusner calls upon the ancient Rabbinic approach to scripture - the conversational dialogue of "Midrash" - while Greeley creatively renews the narrative tradition of Christianity. Together they show that differences in responses to scripture enrich the possibilities of biblical renewal.<br>

If I only knew the story and not the history that begins there, would I predict that the man and wife portrayed here would so enchant so much of humanity? Well, yes, I think I would. The reason is that, with Abraham and Sarah, people we can believe really lived and breathed enter the story.

  Abstract: In its concern for achieving a greater adaptation of Christian doctrines to the contemporary social conditions of Latin America, liberation theology offers divergent views on many social conceptions inherited from the Baroque scholastic tradition. It also takes its inspiration from some Marxist theories concerning social structures and institutional violence, in order to respond to the new manifestations of poverty and oppression which are appearing in Latin American societies. Although Baroque scholasticism, Marxism and liberation theology agree on notions such as the “the finality of history,” the conflicts of interpretation between Christianism and Marxism have compelled the liberation theologians to reformulate<br>

Questioning the “hegemony of the centre,” they often examine the problems of their societies from a fresh perspective. In the process, they expose the insidious effects of colonialism on the colonized, who ultimately lose sight of their own history, heritage and at times even their identity.

First treated during the Middle Ages, the problem of exile lends itself in various ways to literary study. One such way is provided by the exiled character him or herself, a source of insight into a wide sphere of social issues. Appearing periodically in Latin American literature to illustrate the various sociopolitical upheavals history, the exile in our own time figures prominently in Chilean writing in Canada, where writers are currently reworking this theme, each in their own style.

  Book Title: Everyone Says No-Public Service Broadcasting and the Failure of Translation<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): CONWAY KYLE<br>
  Abstract: Quebec has never signed on to Canada's constitution. After both major attempts to win Quebec's approval - the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords - failed, Quebec came within a fraction of a percentage point of voting for independence. Everyone Says No examines how the failure of these accords was depicted in French and English media and the ways in which journalists' reporting failed to translate the differences between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Focusing on the English- and French-language networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Kyle Conway draws on the CBC/Radio Canada rich print and video archive as well as journalists' accounts of their reporting to revisit the story of the accords and the furor they stirred in both French and English Canada. He shows that CBC/Radio Canada attempts to translate language and culture and encourage understanding among Canadians actually confirmed viewers' pre-existing assumptions rather than challenging them. The first book to examine translation in Canadian news, Everyone Says No also provides insight into Canada's constitutional history and the challenges faced by contemporary public service broadcasters in increasingly multilingual and multicultural communities.<br>

  Abstract: The numerous narrative techniques available to represent war and violence must allow for the expression of an immense range of perspectives. It spans from the survey perspective of the historian to the personal experiences of participants in the war such as soldiers or civilians, from first-hand experiences to considering the impact on future generations. Representations oscillate between distance and proximity, between critical summary or analysis and personal experience. For historiography in its narrower meaning as historical writing within the scholarly field of history, representing war seems particularly difficult since historiography is traditionally seen as a secondary narrative discourse, one in<br>

  [SECTION THREE: Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442686731">Fighting Words and Images</a><br>
  Abstract: The three chapters that make up this section address questions of identity from perspectives rooted in the disciplines of literary studies, anthropology, and classics, which themselves are simultaneously inflected by ideas drawn from such other domains as history, philosophy, political studies, and sociology. Each considers not so much the frequently discussed ways in which our identities are subject to alteration under conditions of war, but rather the processes whereby identities become mobilized in warʹs many different representational contexts, including commemorative rites and monuments, in order to produce, respectively, political resistance (Jennifer James), social solidarity (Serguei Oushakine), and civic virtue (James<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442686731">Fighting Words and Images</a><br>
  Author(s) CHLUP JAMES T.<br>
  Abstract: In ancient Rome the historianʹs reputation rested on his ability to balance the narrative of events at Rome (
                     domi) and those elsewhere (militae).¹ Of the latter wars were particularly worthy of narration. They necessitated the writing down of Roman history with a special focus on short but intense wars of Romeʹs early period in which she fought for survival against other Italian city states (ca 750–300 BCE); wars fought over several years or decades against rival nations as she established and expanded her empire; and civil wars.<br>

  Abstract: The Renaissance was an important era in Western history because of its immense infl uence on the manner in which individuals conceived of their place in the universe and the way in which this conception facilitated the development of a civility tradition that was not as dependent on theological dogma. The subsequent Protestant Reformation and Enlightenment movements were facilitated by Renaissance interaction values because the Renaissance thinkers set the stage for a reversal in the ideologies that had kept absolutist monarchies in power. Although princes remained all-powerful in the Renaissance city-states, a new appreciation of individualism provided the rationale for<br>

  Abstract: Despite the fact that England’s history is a dizzying narrative of violence, riots, political plots, religious and international wars, and considerable exploitation of the poor (Tilly [1995] 2005), an outright English revolution was avoided due to steadily improving economic and judicial systems (Gilmour 1993).

  Abstract: In Part I we tried to show how France, America, and England developed different civility preferences due to the manner in which each nation was affected by a variety of factors, including political philosophy and system of government, religion, intellectual history, geography, economy, familial norms, and the manner in which emotions were restrained and expressed. By the close of the nineteenth century each nation possessed its own civility and interaction ethos. The industrialization of the West did not have a substantial levelling effect over national identity or national ideology.<br>

  Abstract: The study of civility is the study not only of the social history of a culture but of the human need for satisfactory social bonds and the problems that emerge when these bonds become too loose or too tight. When they are too tight, we are left with a collectivism that engulfs the individual, drowning out personal needs and aspirations. When they are too loose, the individual is deprived of the safety of communal norms and abandoned to a wasteland of freedom in which interactions between self and others lack meaning and depth.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/9781442696907">Avant-Garde Canadian Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: The history of the term ‘avant-garde’ in Europe has been thoroughly documented by various continental scholars with no substantial disagreements about the early development and uses of the term.¹ The idea of an avant-garde was first coined in fifteenth-century France to describe the military unit at the fore of the army – the avant-garde was the group that defended the country and all it represented, and that, upon successful defence, pushed forth into new territory. The avant-garde used violence to protect and enlarge a nation’s territorial holdings. From this militaristic and nationalistic root, the term avant-garde transitioned from a literal implication<br>

  Abstract: In chapter 4 we saw emerge a history of the subject who foregrounded the act of writing by documenting his past and affirming the ethically constructive nature of poetry. In the desire to narrate was discovered a source of the sacred, a spiritual quality intrinsic to the act of selfdisclosure. In my analysis of the poet’s use of antithesis, I showed how this trope belied the stereotype of psychological inertia and became a source of eurhythmic harmony. So, too, the use of parallelism was seen to bring into focus the problematic of desire and the will, mitigating the presence of<br>

  Abstract: In the final forty-eight poems, many of which are rearranged during the late 1360s, one is abreast of the ultimate dilemma, that of time.¹ The emotional oscillations of the earlier poems of Part 2 recede as the narrative incorporates the events of the personal story into the metaphysical prospects of eternity and timelessness. We saw in chapter 6 the confrontation between the progressive time of history and the circular, repetitive time of nature. Now the neutral (kairotic, rhythmic) time of contemplation has assumed prominence. The appropriate narrative form for this “in-between” time is the parable, a mode that is accompanied<br>

  Abstract: At first sight, we ought to make some kind of survey of the history of French Canada either to trace out a particular route taken by freedom or to map or describe the obstacles in its way. In doing this in so little space, one could only reveal one’s prejudices and pin down with a handful of vague historical reminiscences the more or less arbitrary choices we are now making. On the other hand, it is not at all clear that we have to involve the past in any debate on freedom. I have the strong impression that, for many<br>

  Abstract: In the twenty-fifth canto of the

With these words, Beatrice glosses Dante’s journey in retrospect, according to the figure of Exodus, the Old Testament story that was taken by mediaeval exegetes to be a foreshadowing of the coming of Christ.

  Abstract: I CONFESS I COULD have chosen a better day than June 5, 1967, to speak about “A New History.” As we look at the war that has broken out in the Middle East, we must have the feeling that this is the oldest of all histories, going right back to the hominids dug up in Kenya from forty millennia of dust with their weapons lying beside them.

  Abstract: IT is QUITE EVIDENT that I would not be discussing such a controversial subject as “Architecture 1967: Progress or Regression?” were it not for a fortuitous but significant coincidence. The year 1967 is not only the Canadian Centennial, a very happy event, but also the third centenary of a tragic episode in architectural history. In 1667 Francesco Borromini, perhaps the greatest architect of the Baroque period, committed suicide. Why? we ask ourselves. Was he neurotic, sexually frustrated, unhappily married? Actually he killed himself because he felt and knew that everything he had been struggling to accomplish during his life was<br>

  Abstract: MY SUBJECT in this lecture is perhaps more concerned with the human reaction to cosmology rather than with cosmology itself, since I have become more and more fascinated with the way the human muid responds to changes and advances in science. Cosmology excites particularly strong, varied and interesting responses, for the subject matter is the structure and history of the universe as a whole. It is therefore not in the least surprising that people have been fascinated by it for thousands of years. Nor is it surprising that it belongs among the most speculative and rapidly varying subjects in the<br>

And while each country’s film industry has a distinct history, there are some similarities, one of which is an auteur-style production context, where filmmakers are generally responsible for all aspects of production, including financing and creation (Armes 2009: 5).

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frisch Andrea<br>
  Abstract: This study argues that the political and legislative process of forgetting internal differences, undertaken in France after the civil wars of the sixteenth century, leads to subtle yet fundamental shifts in the broader conception of the relationship between readers or spectators on the one hand, and the matter of history, on the other. These shifts, occasioned by the desire for communal reconciliation and generally associated with an increasingly modern sensibility, will nonetheless prove useful to the ideologies of cultural and political absolutism.<br>

The most dramatic of these visions imagined the king as the agent of divine justice in its Old Testament form: a series of writers advocated the use of violence to rid France of heresy and thus reunite the French.

  Author(s) Katona Eszter<br>
  Abstract: In film history, there is one sentence that is for me irrefutably true: the not-filmed criticises that which is filmed. A variant of this assertion can be found in Angelopoulos’ To Βλέμμα του Οδυσσέα (
                  Ulysses’ Gaze, 1995), in which a Greek director (played by Harvey Keitel) comes back from the USA to Europe and goes in search of undeveloped rolls of film by the Manakis brothers from 1905. This film is about the question of tradition, about the contradictions between the past and the present historical moments. Angelopoulos tells a story about Greece while directing his gaze to other countries.<br>

  Author(s) Steven Mark<br>
  Abstract: The twenty-eighth Cannes Film Festival in 1975 was marked by the enthusiastic reception of a film that did not officially represent Greece, the country of its production. The right-wing government of the time refused to nominate it because it considered the leftist portrayal of modern national history offensive. Yet a Greek filmmaker and his crew managed to smuggle a copy of this film and show it as part of Pierre-Henri Deleau’s renowned programme, the Directors’ Fortnight. The filmmaker was Theo Angelopoulos and the film O Θίασος ( (

  Author(s) Jameson Fredric<br>
  Abstract: The easier way to explain our failure to grant Theo Angelopoulos the position he deserves in modern cinema – that he is less theoretically experimental than Godard or less politically ostentatious than Pasolini we can grant, but why we fail to love seeing his films more than those of Antonioni or Fellini remains something of a mystery – clearly lies in the character of modern Greek history, which is far less familiar than that of the western European countries.

  Abstract: Many of Theo Angelopoulos’ otherwise affectionate critics deride the final film he completed as an artistic failure. In Fredric Jameson’s view, Η Σκόνη του Χρόνου (
                  The Dust of Time, 2008) is an unsuccessful attempt ‘to break new ground by transferring the paradigm of discontinuous collective temporalities to the drama of individuals’, doing so in such a way that the historical terrain Angelopoulos once charted so heroically persists only on a distant horizon. The director himself concedes the objective basis of this transformation. He insists that, in his final films, ‘history becomes something of a fresco in the background. Put another<br>

  Abstract: Angelopoulos’ Τοπίο στην Ομίχλη (

The key protagonists in the film are two runaway children, the eleven-year-old Voula (Tania Palaiologou), and the five-year-old Alexander (Michalis Zeke), and a young adult Orestes (Stratos Tzortzoglou). Voula bears the name of Angelopoulos’ late sister,¹ producing an emotional proximity and equivalence with the filmmaker that supports an argument I wish to make in this paper, namely that<br>

  Author(s) Brown Precious<br>
  Abstract: An essential (albeit controversial) point should immediately be made clear: the work of Angelopoulos is not ‘modernist’ in the sense that Anglo-Saxon critics have given to this term to qualify, in art history, a time past, but still belonging to modernity.¹ From end to end, Angelopoulos’ work is, in fact, traversed by history. Yet modernity is defined precisely by our awareness of unsurpassable historicity. In the words of Jacques Rancière, we have entered into the ‘ age of history’. He adds that it is also the ‘age of cinema’, as this late art possesses a singular power of ‘historicity and<br>

Given the discipline’s historical attachments to a definition of ‘medicine’ that rather narrowly refers to biomedicine as developed in Europe and the US from the eighteenth century onwards, the medical humanities are not the most obvious starting point for such an inquiry. At the same time, they do offer one advantage over neighbouring disciplines like a medical history, anthropology or science and technology studies for someone like myself, a clinician as well as a historian and anthropologist: their<br>

Such historical grounding requires taking a long cultural perspective, going beyond traditional medical history – typically the history of disease, treatment and practice – to trace the origins and development of the ideas that underpin medicine in its broadest sense – ideas concerning the most fundamental aspects of human existence: health and illness, body and mind, gender and family, care and community.¹ Historical sources can only go so far in illuminating such topics; we must also look to other cultural texts, and in particular literary texts, which, through their imaginative worlds,<br>

  Abstract: Investigating the core questions about Arab identity and history, this book tackles the time-honoured stereotypes that depict Arabs as ancient Arabian Bedouin, and reveals the stories to be a myth: tales told by Muslims to recreate the past to explain the meaning of Islam and its origins.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: A book about the history of the Arab people strikes its path into seemingly well-worn ground. There is nearly a millennium-worth of Arabic literature and a several century-strong tradition of European writing that portrays the Arabs as Arabia’s original population, an array of ancient Bedouin tribes roaming vast expanses of solemn sand-sea until the dawn of the seventh century when Islam’s rise stirred them from their long Arabian subsistence into a wave of rapid conquest and settlement across the Middle East that laid the ground for today’s Arab World. This familiar story has persuaded many, and the sum of much<br>

  1  Imagining Ancient Arabs: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: The evidence about pre-Islamic Arabian populations emanates from two perspectives: (1) the writings of peoples from outside Arabia who, across the 1,500 years from the Assyrians in the ninth century BCE to Islam’s rise in the seventh century CE, recorded many stories about Arabians, and (2) voices from within the Arabian Peninsula itself, preserved in inscriptions from as early as the eighth century BCE. Both bodies of sources contain numerous and intriguing references to an array of ancient peoples whose names resemble ‘Arab’, and it may seem logical enough that Arab history can be written by synthesising the material, but,<br>

  4  Interpreting Arabs: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: When third/ninth-century Iraqi writers began their efforts to gather the many pieces into which memories of Islam’s rise had scattered, they imagined that Islam’s first believers all constituted a unified community of Arabs, and they set about assembling narratives of Islam’s rise into an Arab story. The sum of their writings had the seminal result of creating the impression that pre-Islamic Arabia was inhabited by ‘Arabs’. Akin to the construction of communal identities across the world, the Muslim-era writings obscured the Arab community’s origins in early Islam and cast Arabness back into a deep, ancient pre-history, cobbling memories of tribes,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: In the face of assimilation and the seismic changes in the political structure which deprived Arab groups of their status in third/ninth-century Iraq, it is remarkable that scholarly interest in ancient
                  Arabicaparadoxically blossomed after the mid-third/ninth century. Despite urban Iraqi society’s abandonment of Arab tribal affiliations (nisba) and the severance of urban Iraq from desert Arabia in the wake of the escalating Qarāmiṭa crisis and the collapse of Hajj traffic, Iraqi writers produced an unprecedented outpouring of literature about Arabness and Arab history, resulting in what today constitute the ‘primary sources’ about pre-Islamic Arabia. When reading these sources, it<br>

  Abstract: In

Beginning with his first book,The Man without Content, Agamben has repeatedly ignored Louis Althusser’s suggestion that ‘Marx’s early works do not have to be taken into account’¹ and turned to theParis Manuscriptsin the course of formulating his own accounts of praxis and of history.² Indeed, references to Marx in Agamben’s<br>

  Author(s) Burry Alexander<br>
  Abstract: Russian literature has occupied a special position as an object of cinematic adaptation in the hundred-year-plus history of film. The invention and development of the medium closely followed a period of robust literary and cultural achievements rare for any nation. Early in the 1800s, Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, and Mikhail Lermontov launched the so-called Golden Age of poetry and prose. In the latter part of the century, Ivan Turgenev, Fedor Dostoevskii, and Lev Tolstoi established the international dominance of the Russian novel through compulsively readable narratives that featured bold generic experimentation and a nearly obsessive focus on what the critic<br>

  Abstract: While I’ve been working on this book I’ve frequently found myself explaining that I’m not writing a study of song. Yet music and poetry do

What we know of human prehistory suggests that they share an overlapping origin, in live performance, as material that was improvised and memorised, and that relied on traditions of collective transmission.

  Author(s) Deleuze Gilles<br>
  Abstract: Foucault refers to his work as “studies in history,” though he does not see it as “the work of an historian.” He does the work of a philosopher, but he does not work on the philosophy of history. What does it mean to think? Foucault has never dealt with any other problem (hence his debt to Heidegger). And the historical? It is formations which are stratified, made up of strata. But to think is to reach a non-striated material, somewhere between the layers, in the interstices. Thinking has an essential relation to history, but it is no more historical than<br>

  Author(s) Feldman Alex<br>
  Abstract: Deleuze returned often to the “admiration” and “affection” he felt for Foucault.¹ In the 1970s, he began to present Foucault as the contemporary philosopher who had done the most to reframe the question of history. Coming from a philosopher who insists so much on the opposition between becoming and history, this admiration invites notice. Deleuze, like Foucault, but also with him, and while discovering his thought, confronts this new way of dealing with empirical historicity: to take it epistemologically, in the form of the archive, without, for all that, renouncing the critique of linear chronology and of teleological or causal<br>

  Abstract: Gilles Deleuze:So you want to begin with the GIP. You will have to double-check what I tell you. I have no memory; it is like trying to describe a dream; it’s rather vague. After ’68, there were many groups, very different groups, but necessarily compact ones. It was post-68. They survived; they all had a past. Foucault insisted on the fact that ’68 had no importance for him. He already had a history as an important philosopher, but he was not burdened with a history from ’68.

  Abstract: In Chapter 1, ‘Poststructuralism and Modern European Philosophy’, Lumsden emphasises the connection between poststructuralism and post-Kantian idealism, Hegel in particular. Key here is Heidegger’s reading of the history of philosophy and how it has, implicitly and explicitly, functioned as the interpretative frame through which poststructuralism itself approaches the history of philosophy. This, for Lumsden, explains why Hegel, at least in the case of Deleuze and Derrida, is the confluence and culmination of all the problematic strains that run through modern philosophy.<br>

  Author(s) Holohan Conn<br>
  Abstract: In the two books he wrote on the cinematic image, Gilles Deleuze proposes a fundamental break in the history of film form. This break occurred, he declares, sometime around the end of the Second World War and finds its first expression in the work of Italian neorealist film-makers such as Roberto Rossellini. In Rossellini’s images of aimless characters wandering through the ruins of a bombed-out Europe, Deleuze uncovers a decisive rupture with the logic of classical cinema, a rejection of the possibility for action upon which classical narrative depends.

  Abstract: In ‘Energumen capitalism’, the review of
                  Anti-Oedipus, Lyotard (1977) hits three birds with one stone. First, he is looking for other dissident interlocutors than those ofSocialisme and Barbarie– the group with whom he shared the Marxist critique of Stalinism, Trotskism and Maoism, as well as militant activism, in particular during the Algerian war. Then, he sets out to guide the radicalism of Deleuze and Guattari back to a less simplistic conception of institutions (family, State, money), which supposedly immobilise the nomadism of flows. Finally, Lyotard starts to suspect his own ‘critical’ position. The history of revolutions and of<br>

  Author(s) Neumann Michael<br>
  Abstract: Political philosophy plays virtually no role in the early history of analytic philosophy. The most prominent political philosopher after Mill, Thomas Hill Green, had too much of Kant and Rousseau to suit the tastes of the early analytic philosophers. G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad concerned themselves with ethics, not political philosophy. Bertrand Russell went on to write political works, but they had virtually no philosophical stature or influence. But what really blocked the development of an analytic political philosophy was the rise of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy.

  Author(s) Angelova Emilia<br>
  Abstract: Continental feminist philosophy is a movement of thought unified by the theme of the difference of woman and the difference of the feminine. But it is by no means monolithic in method or content. It begins with Simone de Beauvoir’s existentialist feminism in the 1940s. For de Beauvoir, the free transcendence of the ‘independent woman’ wrests her from linear history and orients her to something more than equal rights for man and woman, something more than egalitarian ideals. With May 1968 a new phase of French feminist theory began, bringing along with it aesthetic experiences, influences from deconstruction, psychoanalysis and<br>

  Abstract: Written by a team of leading international scholars this crucial period of philosophy is examined from the novel perspective of themes and lines of thought which cut across authors, disciplines, and national boundaries. This fresh approach will open up new ways for specialists and students to conceptualise the history of 19th-century thought within philosophy, politics, religious studies and literature.<br>

  Author(s) Stone Alison<br>
  Abstract: Nineteenth-century philosophy can be broadly characterised by several themes: the conflict between metaphysics and religious faith on the one hand and the empirical sciences on the other; a new focus on history, progress and evolution; new ideas of individuality, society and revolution; and ever-increasing concerns about nihilism.¹ This volume provides a re-examination of nineteenth-century philosophy in terms of these and other themes distinctive of the period.<br>

  Author(s) Welchman Alistair<br>
  Abstract: ‘Romanticism’ is one of the more hotly contested terms in the history of ideas. There is a singular lack of consensus as to its meaning, unity and historical extension and many attempts to fix the category of Romanticism very quickly become blurry. In his
                  Conversations with Eckermann, Goethe says that the concept of Romanticism ‘is now spread over the whole world and occasions so many quarrels and divisions’ (Goethe [1836] 1984: 297) and this situation has not rectified itself in the 180 years since then. But the term was poorly defined from the start. Friedrich Schlegel, frequently claimed as the<br>

  Author(s) Guay Robert<br>
  Abstract: Of the distinctive terminology of nineteenth-century thought, perhaps no word has been more widely adopted than ‘genealogy’.¹ ‘Genealogy’, of course, had a long history before Nietzsche put it in the title of a book, but the original sense of pedigree or family tree is not the one that has become so prominent in contemporary academic discourse.² Nietzsche initiated a new sense of ‘genealogy’ which, oddly, has become popular despite a lack of clarity about what it is.³ My aim here is to clarify this sense of genealogy by situating it in the context of nineteenth-century narrative argument and identifying its<br>

  Author(s) Blackledge Paul<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘revolution’ was first used in an unmistakably modern sense in the eighteenth century to describe the American and French Revolutions. And although it had begun to gravitate towards something like this modern meaning in England in the wake of her seventeenth-century revolutions (Williams 1976; Hill 1991; Hobsbawm 1962: 74–5), John Dunn is right that ‘in a few short months, in the year of 1789, the people of France set their stamp ineffaceably on a political idea which has loomed over the history of the world ever since’ (Dunn 2008: 17).

  Abstract: Engaging with history is a popular experience. It is popular in the sense that it is widespread and has huge appeal. It involves a variety of activities that include visiting museums and heritage sites, watching history programmes on television, collecting antiques and compiling a family history. Over the past thirty years, the development of popular interest in the past, in these and many other ways, has grown up alongside the development in academic life of a sceptical questioning of the value of historical enquiry and a drastic suspicion about the very grounds on which history is represented.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: In the history of modern philosophy, after the systems of Kant and Hegel – systems respectively of the immanent critique and the apotheosis of Reason – the non-rationalist image of philosophy as anti-system or immanently creative Difference is born with Nietzsche. As the first of the three models of Difference analysed by Laruelle, Nietzschean Difference may be considered in an important sense as the base or standard model for the analysis overall.¹ Nietzschean Difference represents, from this point of view, the more general philosophical platform upon which the other, more specialised models of Difference will be constructed. Historically, it is with Nietzsche<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b3gr">François Laruelle’s Philosophies of Difference</a><br>
  Abstract: If for Laruelle Nietzsche establishes the standard model of philosophy as Difference, Heidegger marks the full taking-stock of Difference in relation to the Western tradition as such and draws out the consequences of its immanent critique as the culmination of metaphysics. Whereas Laruelle characterises the Nietzschean model of Difference as one of ‘Idealism’, he designates the Heideggerean model as that of ‘Finitude’. Laruelle’s reading of Heidegger follows the late Heidegger in treating the thought of the ontological difference of Being and beings as still determined and thus relatively constrained by the history of metaphysics. Thus for the late Heidegger, as<br>

  Abstract: We noted early in our opening chapter that in
                  Philosophies of DifferenceLaruelle aims to mount a ‘critique that would no longer be a complement, a rectification, a deconstruction, a supplement’, the object of this critique being philosophy’s need ‘to think through unifying duality, through the synthesis of contraries, through the One as All or as unity of contraries, through dialectic and difference’.¹ We are now in a position to understand this aim more precisely with respect to the triad of models of Difference represented by Nietzsche-Deleuze, Heidegger and Derrida respectively, as well as the (partially anachronistic) history they compose.<br>

  Abstract: Oral history has a salience and familiarity at the beginning of the twenty-first century that is both popular and academic.

  Abstract: Visual images have been the object of study for a variety of disciplines for as long as those disciplines have existed. They include art history in the humanities, most obviously, but also, within the social sciences, the sub-disciplines of visual anthropology and visual sociology. Geography has long understood maps and photographs as central to its project (Harley 1992; Matless 1996; Cosgrove 1998), and clearly many natural sciences use various kinds of images as evidence for their claims. More recently, however, certain kinds of images, and some discipline-specific modes of approaching them, have started to cross those disciplinary boundaries, with interesting<br>

  Abstract: How important is textual analysis in research? What is it? How is it done? And what difference does it make? My contention will be that textual analysis is indispensable to research in cultural criticism, where cultural criticism includes English, cultural history and cultural studies, as well as any other discipline that focuses on texts, or seeks to understand the inscription of culture in its artefacts. And since textual analysis is in the end empirical, I shall set out to exemplify my methodological account with a single instance. The project is to imagine that Titian’s painting of

  Abstract: Both Western and Chinese analysts often presume that democracy is unique to Western civilisation and alien to the Chinese. The roots of Western dynamism are, in turn, assumed to derive from the political complexity of Europe, whereas those of Chinese stagnation from political unity. However, as this chapter illustrates, China in fact experienced fluctuations between unification and division in history. Intense international competition in the classical era (770–221 BCE) gave rise to citizenship rights defined as state– society bargains over the means of war.

Venice has a remarkable history.

  Abstract: The Middle Ages should be studied and understood in its own terms and on its own premises, but a historian must also be able to explain progress, development and the great lineages of history. One of these great lineages is the history of democracy, in which the ‘Dark Ages’ are assumed to be a black hole. The experience of the Nordic countries during this period provides a worthy case study to test the accuracy of this assessment. The word ‘democracy’ directly translated from the Greek means a form of government where the people rule. In the city state (

  Abstract: In Singapore the period from 1890 to 1914 was one of social transformation, demographic shifts, rapid economic development and intellectual ferment. This chapter explores the contributions to democratic thought made by two Chinese Singaporean intellectuals: Lim Boon Keng and Tan Teck Soon. Both were born in Singapore, of Chinese descent, and both became very influential in the dynamic intellectual scene that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. Lim and Tan sought and found in Chinese religion, political philosophy and history a powerful democratic tradition. They believed that this could become the foundation upon which could be constructed a<br>

  Abstract: Between February and April 1848, the conservative order which had dominated Europe since the fall of Napoleon in 1815 was felled by the hammer-blows of revolution across the continent. The revolutions swept liberal governments to power, tasked with forging a new political order based on the principles of civil rights and parliamentary government. By the end of 1849, all the revolutions had collapsed and the short and violent European experiment in liberal (and, in some countries, democratic) politics was over.

Typically associated with the stirring oratory and leadership of Martin Luther King, its philosophies and legacies continue to reverberate throughout America and the world. Demanding freedom and democracy for all, record numbers of black people rose up to challenge the institutional foundations of US white supremacy. They stood nobly and non-violently in the face of police dogs, water cannons and violent mobs, adamant that only love and moral suasion could change America. In overturning segregation and securing black voting rights, the civil rights movement transformed<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Medeiros Carmen<br>
  Abstract: On December 2005, Evo Morales won Bolivia’s presidential election by one of the widest margins in the country’s democratic history, while his party, Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), gained control of congress. The margin of victory (54 per cent of the votes and 25 percentage points ahead of his closest opponent) was, perhaps, overshadowed by Morales self-identification as an indigenous person and as a staunch critic of the neo-liberal project as neo-colonial and undemocratic. This victory raised many doubts from critics and opponents, who saw Morales as unprepared to assume the responsibilities of governing a country. However, under his leadership Bolivia<br>

  Chapter 42  Deliberative Democracy from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b6rb">The Edinburgh Companion to the History of Democracy</a><br>
  Author(s) Rostbøll Christian F.<br>
  Abstract: Over the last twenty years deliberative democracy has become the most discussed theory of democracy. The term was coined by Joseph Bessette in 1980, but academic writing on deliberative democracy really picked up in the early 1990s (Bessette 1980; Hansen 2004). While the idea of giving deliberation a core role in democracy has roots throughout the history of democracy, the most important contemporary theoretical sources for deliberative democrats are the works of Jürgen Habermas and John Rawls (Habermas 1984, 1989, 1996; Rawls 1971, 1996). The theory of deliberative democracy is often directed at two related deficiencies of actual existing democracy,<br>

  Author(s) Keane John<br>
  Abstract: In 1945, following several decades that saw most experiments in democratisation fail, there were only a dozen democracies left on the face of the earth. Since then, despite many ups and downs, democracy has bounced back from near oblivion to become a planetary phenomenon for the first time in its history (Diamond 2008; Dunn 2005; Keane 2009b). Fresh research perspectives are required because democracy has taken root in so many different geographic contexts that several fundamental presuppositions of democratic theory have been invalidated. This metamorphosis remains largely unregistered in the literature on democracy, which still has a distinctively Eurocentric bent,<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, the contributors have brought their expertise to bear on many democratic moments, both expected and unexpected, down through history. Together, these chapters tell quite a story of common people taking their chances to create ideas, opportunities and institutions of government where their collective voices have a role to play and often carry the day. But as more people identify themselves as democrats, as more countries embrace democracy, as there is more opportunity for participation at local, national and international levels, there is also evidence of a lapse of faith, a moment of uncertainty, a loss of<br>

  Abstract: The problem of universal history does not result from the possibility of organising the universe in time, but rather from considering time as a universe. How is it possible to grasp time – structured by the present (maximal presence), the past (weakening of presence), and the future (maximal absence) – as a cumulative order of all past instants, from the most remote to the most present? We raised this question in Chapter III of this book. Universal history inscribes objects and events in an order of comprehension, which leads to the present and points towards the future.

  Abstract: The previous two chapters have considered Woolf’s sense of Beingin-the-world principally from the perspective of her treatment of place. In this chapter, the focus shifts to the notion of temporality, an area of study that is granted particular emphasis in Heidegger’s
                  Being and Time. Specifically, Woolf’s approach to history and historical discourse from the perspective of Being-in-the-world is investigated.¹ Woolf’s interest in the subject of history began at an early age under the instruction of her father, the historian, biographer and man of letters, Sir Leslie Stephen.² A willing student in terms of her adolescent submission to her father’s direction,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1n7qhrd">Virginia Woolf and Being-in-the-world</a><br>
  Abstract: The preceding chapters have explored Woolf’s emphasis throughout her writings on the notion that the individual’s average everyday mode of Being-in-the-world comes to be defined and ‘held in place’ (‘Sketch’: 92) by the typically veiled forces, conventions and prescriptions of the social order, including the often overlapping discourses of patriarchy, religion, nationalism and history. As discussed, such an approach to the relationship between self and world may be contrasted with Heidegger’s ontological emphasis in

  Author(s) Sutch Peter<br>
  Abstract: The concept of ‘evil’ has a long history in the western tradition, extending from early theological debate, through tortured discussion of the relationship between moral and religious issues, to a contemporary context in which moral and political theory have domains of discourse in their own right. The religious roots of the idea of ‘evil’, however, have often made it difficult to accommodate in predominantly secular cultures, especially in multicultural contexts where deeply held beliefs may not be widely shared. Indeed, there has been a tendency in recent decades, especially among political theorists, to set the notion aside as outdated or<br>

  Author(s) Engler Balz<br>
  Abstract: Sculptures, traditionally three-dimensional representations of human beings, have been popular in the history of Shakespeare reception. They usually show the writer himself, occasionally certain figures from his plays, and they do so in different sizes, from larger-than life to miniature knick-knacks, and in different materials, from marble and bronze to china and even Welsh coal. The knick-knack has been popular since the eighteenth century, in the shape of small statues, thimbles, wine-stoppers, teapots, and so on as they can be found today in Stratford souvenir shops; Batman, of course, used a switch hidden in a Shakespeare bust to open the<br>

  Abstract: The literary, however identified, may be said to include many examples of non-fiction, including works of journalism. Given the reporter’s quasi-objective relationship to history, the journalistic article was in some ways seen as a model for much literature in the 1930s, with a writer such as George Orwell specialising equally in fiction, essay-writing and reportage, and a novelist such as Christopher Isherwood fashioning himself in fiction as a news camera ‘recording, not thinking’.² Newspaper articles are, in fact, defined by their place of publication rather than their content, but there are certain likely formal characteristics or principles of journalistic writing<br>

  Abstract: The study of autobiography has been resurgent in recent decades, and the genre is now often discussed by historians, literary critics and others alongside biographies, memoirs, letters, diaries and reminiscences – as well as works more conventionally considered ‘history’ or ‘fiction’ – under the banner of life writing (the term ‘self-life-writing’ is Avrom Fleishman’s). One reason for this is the rise of interdisciplinary areas of study that have found autobiography to be a particularly useful form of writing, and so have accorded it a distinctive place in the study of both authenticity and alterity.

French at the time of Rivarol (the end of the eighteenth century) was the preferred language of European elites from Madrid to Moscow and was widely used as the language of diplomacy; and this was enough to convince Rivarol that the French language was ‘universal’.

  Abstract: David Hume’s 
                  History of England was the most important and widely read history of the English polity published in the eighteenth century.¹ One of its aims was to challenge the kinds of political memory that circulated everywhere in Hanoverian England – in other words, to exorcise Stuart and Cromwellian ghosts, to delegitimise the political memories of Whigs, Tories and Jacobites, of Churchmen and Dissenters, finally to bury the dead. The agenda for The History of England was sketched out in a number of Hume’s essays of the 1740s. Imagine, Hume says, a Member of Parliament in the reign of William or<br>

He served brief spells as a minister to Dissenting congregations first at St Looe in Cornwall and then at Wells in Somerset, where he was ordained in April 1741.¹ He married Miss Elizabeth Bovit of Honiton in Devon and lived the rest of his life there, ministering to a small Dissenting congregation of around a<br>

  Abstract: Several factors converged in the 1770s to bolster interest among Dissenters in their own history. First, in 1767 the long, wearying legal battle between the City of London Corporation and the Protestant Dissenting Deputies came to end when six out of seven Law Lords decided in favour of the Dissenting position.¹ By Lord Mansfield’s judgment, Dissent was legally secured. Dissenting religious worship was, he said, ‘not only exempted from punishment, but rendered innocent and lawful: it is established, it is put under the protection, and is not merely under the connivance of the law’.²<br>

It is safe to say, as we stand firmly established in the twenty-first century, that our engagement with history has become almost entirely mediated.

  Abstract: There is a long history of thinkers who have, to certain degrees, evaluated, reflected upon and tried to explain memory and remembering. Not surprisingly, this extends as far back as Plato and Aristotle as well as being found in the more recent philosophical thinking of writers as diverse as Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), Henri Bergson (1859–1941) and Walter Benjamin (1892–1940).

Pierre Nora has argued that a ‘democratization of history’ can occur if emancipatory versions of the past surface: ‘Unlike history, which has always been in the hands of the public authorities, of scholars and specialised peer groups, memory has acquired all the new privileges and prestige of a popular protest movement’ (2002: 6).

  Abstract: Friendship, Cicero tells us, ‘is a kaleidoscope and complicated thing’.¹ We might add a fascinating thing; a kind of love perhaps and an enigma to us. Unlike love, which, on some accounts, is regarded as involuntary, friendship maintains an element of freedom of choice. In common with love, it involves a relationship between two beings and so draws us into the mystery of the difficult notion of the individual in himself or herself. The history of the philosophical literature on friendship reveals a changing semantic paradigm in relation to this notion. We are curious about friendship because as social creatures<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

In 1956, troops of the Warsaw pact states invaded Hungary and cracked down on the Hungarian revolution. This event had heavily dislocating effects on Western political thought – no matter whether Marxist or not. As a reaction, Paul Ricœur published one of his best-known essays, ‘The Political Paradox’, in which he seeks to come to terms philosophically with the exigency of the Hungarian events (1965).

  INTRODUCTION: from:

  Abstract: A recurring image in Jean-Luc Godard’s eight-part video series 
                  Histoire(s) du cinéma (1989–98) shows a man and woman staring intently at a film projection, taken from an early film by Ingmar Bergman, Fängelse (1946). Along with shots of James Stewart peering voyeuristically through a zoom lens in Rear Window (Hitchcock, 1954) the image is developed through the series as a figure of cinema’s gaze upon history. Citing a line from Alain Resnais’ Hiroshima mon amour (1959), the sequence of titles inscribed upon the Fängelse image as it appears in chapter 4B of Godard’s series evokes a failure of witnessing<br>

  Book Title: Modernism and Magic-Experiments with Spiritualism, Theosophy and the Occult<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Leigh<br>
  Abstract: While modernism’s engagement with the occult has been approached by critics as the result of a loss of faith in representation, an attempt to draw on science as the primary discourse of modernity, or as a hidden history of ideas, Leigh Wilson argues that these discourses have at their heart a magical practice which remakes the relationship between world and representation. As Wilson demonstrates, the courses of the occult are based on a magical mimesis which transforms the nature of the copy, from inert to vital, from dead to alive, from static to animated, from powerless to powerful. Wilson explores the aesthetic and political implications of this relationship in the work of those writers, artists and filmmakers who were most self-consciously experimental, including James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Dziga Vertov and Sergei M. Eisenstein.<br>

  Abstract: The cultural history of film has often been rooted in the shifting conceptions of and metaphorical uses of light. Film produces life, movement and action from light, making it seem organic (as light produces life and growth in the natural world), but also uncanny (the creation of life and movement from nothing). That the world is reproduced through the effects of light in photography and film has led numerous critics recently to reassert the uncanny and occult status of the media (Gunning 1995). Indeed light has many occult resonances, from Emanuel Swedenborg, through theories of vitalism, to the metaphorical uses<br>

  Author(s) Murphy Christopher J.<br>
  Abstract: In both the United States and the United Kingdom, the field of intelligence studies represents one of the fastest growing subsets of international history, political science and strategic studies. This dynamism is evidenced not only by the vast volume of publications that are generated, but by the existence of dedicated departments and centres, specialist degree programmes, conferences and professional associations. In the US, intelligence is taught at a host of top universities, typically in the form of advanced option courses and special subjects. Beyond this, there are institutes specifically designed to prepare students for entry-level positions in the intelligence community,<br>

  Author(s) Aldrich Richard J.<br>
  Abstract: Where does the history of the history of intelligence begin? As a self-conscious academic subject, intelligence history is widely understood to have started in the 1980s. In Britain, Christopher Andrew and David Dilks proclaimed a deliberate manifesto for intelligence historians in 1984, urging scholars to explore the ‘missing dimension’. Broadly contemporaneous with this, the American historian Richard Immerman asserted that it was important to incorporate covert action into any sophisticated understanding of foreign policy. The mid-1980s also saw the creation of the journal

  Abstract: Psychoanalysis is an antiphilosophy. Despite the precision of this concept and this claim, their implications remain controversial. This book thus introduces the concept of antiphilosophy, speaks of its constitution and pertinence with respect to psychoanalysis, and examines the consequences of such a determination through a sequence of case-studies. Although the concept has some highly abstract aspects and a somewhat forbidding intellectual history, it is deployed here, first, as a kind of corrosive of received ideas, and, second, as an affirmative means of characterising psychoanalysis that captures something essential, if often elided, about the peculiar status of the practice.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I will reread an overdetermined and complex event in the prehistory of psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud’s so-called ‘cocaine episode’ from the 1880s, in which, prior to entering private practice as a psychiatrist, Freud attempted a kind of reputational ‘get-rich-quick’ scheme, staking his scientific credentials on what has appeared to many subsequent commentators as unethical drug experimentation. While I re-examine this event by drawing on the requisite historical facts and secondary literature, my aim is different from that of a standard revisionist account. In fine, I wish to show something quite counter-intuitive: how Freud came to imagine the possibility<br>

  Book Title: Muriel Rukeyser and Documentary-The Poetics of Connection<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gander Catherine<br>
  Abstract: This study of twentieth-century American poet Muriel Rukeyser explores the multiple avenues of her ‘poetics of connection’ to reveal a profound engagement with the equally intertextual documentary genre. It examines previously overlooked photo narratives, poetry, prose and archival material and demonstrates an enduring dialogue between the poet’s relational aesthetics and documentary’s similarly interdisciplinary and creative approach to the world. By considering the sources of documentary in Rukeyser’s work, the study provides insight into her guiding poetic principles, situating her as a vital figure in the history of twentieth-century American literature and culture, and as a pioneering personality in the development of American Studies.Key Features: Provides a new, interdisciplinary perspective on a critically neglected author, situating her firmly within the canon of essential twentieth century American poetsExamines previously overlooked material, including photo narratives, poetry, prose, and archival materialHighlights Rukeyser’s role in the formation of American StudiesOutlines the development of documentary in the 1930s, and its role in the formation of an American literary and cultural aesthetic<br>

  Book Title: Travellers' Tales of Wonder-Chatwin, Naipaul, Sebald<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cooke Simon<br>
  Abstract: Exploring travellers’ tales of wonder in contemporary literature, this study challenges a sensibility of disenchantment with travel. It reassesses travel writing as an aesthetically and ethically innovative form in contemporary international literature, and demonstrates the crucial role of wonder in the travel narratives of writers such as Bruce Chatwin, V.S. Naipaul, and W.G. Sebald. Their ‘travellers’ tales of wonder’ are read as a challenge to the hubris of thinking the world too well known, and an invitation to encounter the world – including its most troubling histories – with a sense of wonder.Key FeaturesReassesses the place of travel writing in literary history to argue that the genre is important as a site of aesthetic innovation and ethical engagement in contemporary literatureDemonstrates the central role of wonder in travel accounts often regarded as narratives of disenchantmentExplores the way travellers’ tales of wonder recover and renew ancient and early modern forms in approaching modern and contemporary issuesOffers new, in-depth readings of the work of three major writers, in each case drawing on as yet unpublished results of archival research<br>

  Abstract: Voyages and travels are among the oldest and most culturally widespread forms in literary history. Among the earliest extant texts is a traveller’s tale of an island of marvels, ‘The Shipwrecked Sailor’ (Tappan 1914: 41–6), written in Egypt’s Twelfth Dynasty (that is, around 2200 bce). The journey is the common denominator for accounts as varied as

The body of work he brought into expression from the late 1980s through to his death in a car accident in 2001, not far from his adopted home of some twenty years near Norwich, England, was itself a culmination, the harvest of a long personal apprenticeship: a German émigré, Sebald had been active as an academic in England since the 1960s, and was a professor of European literature at the University of East Anglia when his first major ‘non-academic’ work, the<br>

                  Madame Bovaryhas been one of the most discussed books in the history of world literature. Despite the distinction and importance of his other novels, Flaubert had to reconcile himself to the fact that he became known, once and forever, as the author ofMadame Bovary. The popularity of the novel has increased rather than diminished with time.

  Author(s) Moll Patience<br>
  Abstract: The problem of Rousseau’s presence within English Romanticism, especially among the major poets, which is to say Coleridge, Wordsworth, Blake, Keats, and Shelley, has been treated by traditional comparative literature as a simply historical question. It has been treated, that is to say, at the level of so-called general ideas,
                  idées reçues, and commonplaces to which the history of ideas sometimes risks sacrificing the complexity of readings.¹ The works that treat the question are few, especially in the English and German realms, where the reading of Rousseau continues to come up against some very deeply entrenched prejudices.

  Abstract: The selection combines the theoretical side of Rousseau’s thought, which is primarily of interest to students of political science and of intellectual history, with the more purely literary components of the works. It also provides the means to make connections between these two aspects of the work, by including such texts as the “Essay on the Origins of Language,” in which the link between Rousseau’s reflections on language and his political theory becomes manifest. The book could therefore be used

  Abstract: The project is the outcome of a fifteen-year-long concern with the history and the poetics of romantic and post-romantic literature in France, Germany and England. It began as a study of the poetry of Mallarmé, Yeats, and George written as a doctoral dissertation at Harvard under the title “The Post-Romantic Predicament.” In the course of rewriting this thesis for publication, I increasingly felt the need for a wider historical framework reaching back to the later part of the eighteenth century.

  Author(s): Davey Nicholas<br>
  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer's poetics completely overturns the European aesthetic tradition. By concentrating on the experience of meaning, Unfinished Worlds shows how Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics transforms aesthetics into a mode of attentive practice. It has deep implications for all of the humanities, and how we can understand the meaning of poetry, art, literature, history and theology. His emphasis on participation promises an approach that will revolutionise aesthetic and hermeneutic practice, and gives us new ways to think about the cultural productivity and social legitimacy of the humanities.<br>

  Book Title: Regional Modernisms-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moran James<br>
  Abstract: Where did literary modernism happen? In this book, a range of scholars seek to answer this question, re-evaluating the parameters of modernism in the light of recent developments in literary geography as well as literary history, examining an array of different literary forms including novels, poetry, theatre, and ‘little magazines’. The volume identifies and appraises the local attachments of modernist texts in particular geographical regions and also interrogates the idea of the 'regional' in light of the alienating displacements of transnational modernity. The essays collected here make fresh interventions in the field of modernist studies and acknowledge the legacies of regional modernisms for post-war representations of place and landscape. Individual essays discuss canonical figures (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence) as well as more marginal or lesser-known writers (Dylan Thomas, Hugh MacDiarmid, J. M. Synge, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Alfred Orage, Leo Walmsley, Lynette Roberts, Michael McLaverty, and Basil Bunting) from across Britain and Ireland.<br>

  Book Title: Staging Philosophy-Intersections of Theater, Performance, and Philosophy<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Saltz David Z.<br>
  Abstract: The fifteen original essays in
      Staging Philosophymake useful connections between the discipline of philosophy and the fields of theater and performance and use these insights to develop new theories about theater. Each of the contributors-leading scholars in the fields of performance and philosophy-breaks new ground, presents new arguments, and offers new theories that will pave the way for future scholarship.Staging Philosophyraises issues of critical importance by providing case studies of various philosophical movements and schools of thought, including aesthetics, analytic philosophy, phenomenology, deconstruction, critical realism, and cognitive science. The essays, which are organized into three sections-history and method, presence, and reception-take up fundamental issues such as spectatorship, empathy, ethics, theater as literature, and the essence of live performance. While some essays challenge assertions made by critics and historians of theater and performance, others analyze the assumptions of manifestos that prescribe how practitioners should go about creating texts and performances. The first book to bridge the disciplines of theater and philosophy,Staging Philosophywill provoke, stimulate, engage, and ultimately bring theater to the foreground of intellectual inquiry while it inspires further philosophical investigation into theater and performance.David Krasneris Associate Professor of Theater Studies, African American Studies, and English at Yale University.

  Abstract: Philosophy, a discipline concerned with truth, being, and the foundations of knowledge, was predestined to abhor the theater, which is premised on lying, appearance, and the construction of false worlds. Philosophical attacks on the theater, as they accompany the history of philosophy from Plato onward, are thus not only frequent but also unsurprising. At the same time, self-declared defenders of the theater, including many playwrights, have fought back by creating mock philosophers who are exposed as fools and charlatans on the stage, a tradition that begins with Aristophanes’ unflattering portrayal of Socrates in

In particular, the assumption that theatrical performance presents illusory, as opposed to real, events was an orthodoxy in twentiethcentury theory, from the Prague structuralists through existentialism and phenomenology and, most emphatically, semiotics and poststructuralist theory.

As the physician listens and responds to this story, a special kind of relationship begins to develop between the patient and doctor. At its best, it is personal and professional at once. It is often charged with deeply felt emotion on the part of the patient—fear and anxiety, anger, sadness, or a combination of these feelings—and with empathetic and more or less calm attention on the part of the physician.

Patients commonly complain that their doctor does not listen. But when patients are heard, they report that their doctor was empathetic.

  Abstract: The Neuroscientific Turnbrings together 19 scholars from a variety of fields to reflect on the promises of and challenges facing emergent "neurodisciplines" such as neuroethics, neuroeconomics, and neurohistory. In the aftermath of the Decade of the Brain, neuroscience has become one of the hottest topics of study---not only for scientists but also, increasingly, for scholars from the humanities and social sciences. While the popular press has simultaneously lauded and loathed the coming "neurorevolution," the academy has yet to voice any collective speculations about whether there is any coherence to this neuroscientific turn; what this turn will and should produce; and what implications it has for inter- or transdisciplinary inquiry.<br>

Pivots turn away from and turn toward, in this case away from psychoanalytic models and toward contemporary neuroscientific ones.

                  Feldtbuch der Wundartzney(1517) and medical doctor Lorenz Fries’s (ca. 1490–1530)Spiegel der Artzney(1518) have been used as a keying mechanism to help delimit the boundaries of the modern brain.¹ Gersdorff’s book includes fugitive sheets (fliegende Blätter), one of which represents an anatomized body and brain in a single sheet broadside; copies of this fugitive sheet were subsequently reprinted the next year in Fries’s text. In the history of the brain, these images mark the beginning of all subsequent, similarly represented cerebral cortices.² Hans<br>

  Author(s) Fitzpatrick Susan M.<br>
  Abstract: Research questions of interest to neuroscientists share a natural overlap with those pursued by scholars studying philosophy, art, music, history, or literature. The common ground is a shared desire to understand the workings of the human mind. What initially attracts someone to study neuroscience, regardless of what aspects of nervous system function an individual career may become focused on (e.g., basic functions of the synapse), is the allure of contributing knowledge that deepens our understanding of our minds. Many neuroscientists want to know how it is that the activities of the cells of the nervous system, individually and collectively, contribute<br>

  Author(s) Michelson Bruce<br>
  Abstract: The controversy is severe; provocative research is evolving rapidly—and for the humanities the stakes are higher than usual. To the study of cultural history and the teaching and criticism of imaginative literature, this revolution under way in the neurosciences is not just another chance to play with terminology and imperfectly understood perspectives borrowed from other disciplines. With potential to destabilize and transform so many commonplace assumptions about the nature of thinking and the dynamics of consciousness, twenty-first-century neuroscience challenges basic conventions about the structure and continuity of the mind and the self, conventions that subtend not only everyday humanist<br>

  Abstract: In 1897, toward the end of the period covered in this book, a new genre emerged alongside the constellation of visual and literary arts dedicated to a realist Christ image: the Jesus movie. There are many ways in which the early history of the Jesus movie echoes that of the Jesus novel more than a half century earlier, from the new genre’s immediate international scope to the hesitant, incremental advance of its pictorial resources. Over the years of 1897 and 1898 alone, French and American production companies, each working in relative isolation, made about half a dozen known Jesus movies,<br>

  Abstract: Childless though he was, Immanuel Kant is the towering (or assumed) father of many offspring, one of which is the subject of this book: the theories of democratic peace; those theories that try to explain the absence (or near absence) of war between consolidated democracies. And just as Kant’s hometown of Königsberg changed hands and names throughout its history, so the theories of democratic peace have gone through transformations, assuming different incarnations, or different sorts of idea structures. This book is about the political biography of those theories, and it will analyze the complex sociopolitical process by which they migrated<br>

  Book Title: Traces of the Past-Classics between History and Archaeology<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassi Karen<br>
  Abstract: What are we doing when we walk into an archaeological museum or onto an archaeological site? What do the objects and features we encounter in these unique places mean and, more specifically, how do they convey to us something about the beliefs and activities of formerly living humans? In short, how do visible remains and ruins in the present give meaning to the human past? Karen Bassi addresses these questions through detailed close readings of canonical works spanning the archaic to the classical periods of ancient Greek culture, showing how the past is constituted in descriptions of what narrators and characters see in their present context. She introduces the term protoarchaeological to refer to narratives that navigate the gap between linguistic representation and empirical observation-between words and things-in accessing and giving meaning to the past. Such narratives invite readers to view the past as a receding visual field and, in the process, to cross the disciplinary boundaries that divide literature, history, and archaeology.Aimed at classicists, literary scholars, ancient historians, cultural historians, and archaeological theorists, the book combines three areas of research: time as a feature of narrative structure in literary theory; the concept of "the past itself" in the philosophy of history; and the ontological status of material objects in archaeological theory. Each of five central chapters explores how specific protoarchaeological narratives-from the fate of Zeus' stone in Hesiod's Theogony to the contest between words and objects in Aristophanes' Frogs-both expose and attempt to bridge this gap. Throughout, the book serves as a response to Herodotus' task in writing the Histories, namely, to ensure that "the past deeds of men do not fade with time."<br>

  Author(s) Milligan Jennifer S.<br>
  Abstract: In his scathing essay on the coup d’état that brought France’s Second Empire to power, Karl Marx produced some of his most memorable (or at least quotable) musings on the nature of history. “Men,” he wrote, “make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances encountered, given and transmitted from the past.”¹ Focused on material conditions, Marx’s criticism did not extend to the Archives, where Louis Napoleon’s imperial government sought to control the conditions for men to write French history.

  Abstract: Whether even the most well-intentioned and neutral scholar could ever produce an objective, scientific history has long been the subject of fractious debate among historians, as many archivists are aware. That “noble dream,” as Peter Novick described this quest in an important volume some fifteen years ago, reflects for many historians a quaint legacy of romantic positivism, the failure to recognize how facts and historical truths are accessible only through creative acts of imagination.¹ The issues here are complicated. They range from whether the kinds of presuppositions historians bring to their research necessarily affect their determination of what is “factual,”<br>

  Abstract: The diverse essays included in this section take up complicated questions about the role of archives in conditioning social memory and creating certain kinds of cultural understandings. The complex relationship between social memories and elements of social culture is itself a growing area of concern in the fields of history, literature, anthropology, and social psychology. Not surprisingly, the relationship between archives and social memory provoked lively discussion among scholars in all of these fields at our interdisciplinary seminar. At its core, the question involves a set of issues that bear directly on understandings of what is a record, what is<br>

  Abstract: Do all objects tell the truth? Are artifacts essential to the study of history? Can we understand the past by looking and examining the things people used and made, as Henry Ford believed? The study of material culture, which grew out of anthropology and the study of preliterate cultures, has had only a minor influence in the historical profession.

  Abstract: During the past twenty years, the approaches and perspectives associated with both poststructuralism and feminism have prompted historians to question the centrality of some of social history’s most basic assumptions, opening the door to what Patrick Joyce has called a “self-reflexive and historicized understanding” of social history and its epistemological legacy.¹ In particular, many scholars now agree that race, gender, class, and national identities do not, as was previously thought, derive exclusively from a network of social referents external to language but rather arise from a system of representations in which language and its referents undergo a continual process of<br>

  Abstract: One of the greatest obstacles to understanding the history of Eastern Europe during and after the Second World War has been that the memories of the events themselves have been constructed ethnically—which is to say, each ethnic group has recorded its own version of the tragic devastation of that era. The postwar phenomena of diasporas and refugee cultures have further splintered memories and perspectives and subsequently channeled them through the prisms of the Cold War, East and West.<br>

  Book Title: Microdramas-Crucibles for Theater and Time<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Muse John H.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Microdramas, John H. Muse argues that plays shorter than twenty minutes deserve sustained attention, and that brevity should be considered a distinct mode of theatrical practice. Focusing on artists for whom brevity became both a structural principle and a tool to investigate theater itself (August Strindberg, Maurice Maeterlinck, F. T. Marinetti, Samuel Beckett, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Caryl Churchill), the book explores four episodes in the history of very short theater, all characterized by the self-conscious embrace of brevity. The story moves from the birth of the modernist microdrama in French little theaters in the 1880s, to the explicit worship of speed in Italian Futurist synthetic theater, to Samuel Beckett's often-misunderstood short plays, and finally to a range of contemporary playwrights whose long compilations of shorts offer a new take on momentary theater.Subjecting short plays to extended scrutiny upends assumptions about brief or minimal art, and about theatrical experience. The book shows that short performances often demand greater attention from audiences than plays that unfold more predictably. Microdramas put pressure on preconceptions about which aspects of theater might be fundamental and about what might qualify as an event. In the process, they suggest answers to crucial questions about time, spectatorship, and significance.<br>

  Book Title: American Night-The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War<br>
  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): WALD ALAN M.<br>
  Abstract: American Night, the final volume of an unprecedented trilogy, brings Alan Wald's multigenerational history of Communist writers to a poignant climax. Using new research to explore the intimate lives of novelists, poets, and critics during the Cold War, Wald reveals a radical community longing for the rebirth of the social vision of the 1930s and struggling with a loss of moral certainty as the Communist worldview was being called into question. The resulting literature, Wald shows, is a haunting record of fracture and struggle linked by common structures of feeling, ones more suggestive of the "negative dialectics" of Theodor Adorno than the traditional social realism of the Left.Establishing new points of contact among Kenneth Fearing, Ann Petry, Alexander Saxton, Richard Wright, Jo Sinclair, Thomas McGrath, and Carlos Bulosan, Wald argues that these writers were in dialogue with psychoanalysis, existentialism, and postwar modernism, often generating moods of piercing emotional acuity and cosmic dissent. He also recounts the contributions of lesser known cultural workers, with a unique accent on gays and lesbians, secular Jews, and people of color. The vexing ambiguities of an era Wald labels "late antifascism" serve to frame an impressive collective biography.<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

  Abstract: This is a study of race and how Americans write about it. In America, writing about race with ink and paper has shaped the race that people see on the flesh and bone bodies of others and of themselves. Words that describe degrees of distinction—shade of skin, curl of hair, shape of lips and eyes—get read onto bodies as distinctions of kind. That is, in American history, writing about race has done the cultural work of defining racial sameness as well as racial difference. Yet in America, writing about race does not end with racial description and classification.<br>

  Abstract: For Joseph Smith Jr. and his earliest followers, the Book of Mormon was more than a book. It was an Indian treasure of ancient golden plates unearthed from a hill called Cumorah located just south of an Upstate New York canal town. It was the last material remnant of a once great pre-Columbian American civilization. It was a history of the origins of America’s native inhabitants. It was a record of Christ’s first mission to the New World as well as a prophetic account of Christ’s imminent return (fig. 1.1).<br>

  Publisher: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Romance Studies<br>

  Abstract: This book, written in Spanish, focuses on the literary and artistic works of such avant-garde figures as Ramon Gomez de la Serna, Benjamin Jarnes, Antonio de Obregon, Juan Chabas, Rosa Chacel, Claudio de la Torre, Almada Negreiros, Maruja Mallo, Mauricio Amster, Manuel Reinoso, Diego Rivera, and Angeles Santos y Victorio Macho. It identifies the attempt to integrate conflicting epistemological, ethical, and sociopolitical categories as the organizational principle driving the avant-garde novel and art. Seen as a means of escaping the Cartesian dualism of mind and matter, the conflict between ethical institutionism and utilitarianism, and the opposition of liberalism by socialism, this "middle path" manifests itself in the avant-garde on various levels: the theory of representation, the development of the protagonist, and the concept of history.<br>

Only in more recent years, however, has a focus on history and memory appeared in research on contemporary European concert dance.

  Abstract: Looking at the history of dance in the modern West, and especially in Europe, where aesthetic modernism began around 1900, there are two characteristics of dance. Whether it is so-called popular dance or a more artistic form, from a sociological perspective, the history of dance is the history of globalization and transnationalism. It is also the record of how urban experiences have been expressed physically. The artistic avant-garde of the twentieth century thrived in large cities, and even folk dances rarely originated in the countryside.<br>

  Abstract: How do emotions change over time? When is hate honorable? What happens when love is translated into different languages? Such questions are now being addressed by historians who trace how emotions have been expressed and understood in different cultures throughout history. Doing Emotions History explores the history of feelings such as love, joy, grief, nostalgia as well as a wide range of others, bringing together the latest and most innovative scholarship on the history of the emotions. Spanning the globe from Asia and Europe to North America, the book provides a crucial overview of this emerging discipline. An international group of scholars reviews the field's current status and variations, addresses many of its central debates, provides models and methods, and proposes an array of possibilities for future research. Emphasizing the field's intersections with anthropology, psychology, sociology, neuroscience, data-mining, and popular culture, this groundbreaking volume demonstrates the affecting potential of doing emotions history.<br>

  CHAPTER 1  MODERN PATTERNS IN EMOTIONS HISTORY from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/j.ctt3fh5m1">Doing Emotions History</a><br>
  Author(s) STEARNS PETER N.<br>
  Abstract: After thirty to forty years of serious, informative work on emotions history, scholars have not clearly answered what would seem a vital and timely question: do emotions and emotional standards change when a society moves toward modernity? This essay seeks to explore the current status of the issue, to indicate promising lines for renewed attention, and to urge greater priority for analysis and discussion.<br>

  Author(s) MATT SUSAN J.<br>
  Abstract: From the very beginning, those who have studied the history of the emotions have realized the difficulties they faced. In 1941, Lucien Febvre, the first scholar to call for such investigations, wrote that the undertaking would be fraught with challenges. He observed, “Any attempt to reconstitute the emotional life of a given period is a task that is at one and the same time extremely attractive and frightfully difficult.”¹ Febvre suggested that emotions of other eras and societies were so very different from those of the present day that their recovery required the scholar to abandon preconceived ideas about the<br>

  Author(s) KUTCHER NORMAN<br>
  Abstract: It would be impossible to begin a chapter on the history of emotions in China without at least making glancing reference to the stereotype of “the emotion-less Chinese.” This shibboleth is of uncomfortably long lineage. It began, most likely, with the coming of nineteenth-century Protestant missionaries to China, men and women who, shocked at the seeming impassivity of the Chinese they encountered, attributed their lack of affect to a kind of racial impermeability to pain and suffering. For these missionaries, it was not much of a leap to argue that once Chinese embraced Christ, among the most precious gifts they<br>

  Author(s) STEINBERG MARK D.<br>
  Abstract: It would be unwise, even harmful, to approach a regional history of emotions looking for essential patterns of national or ethnic character. To be sure, many people have claimed defining emotional traits for their own culture. In the early 1900s, for example, it was common for Russians to speak of a “Russian soul” naturally inclined toward “brooding and melancholy.”¹ More deleterious have been claims about other cultures: Serbs are belligerent, Romanians are intensely emotional, “Gypsies” are impassioned but irresponsible, Germans desire order, Jews are avaricious. National and ethnic cultural stereotypes have histories and are worth studying as revealing constructions and<br>

  Author(s) McMAHON DARRIN M.<br>
  Abstract: Are historians of emotions a negative lot? Do they give greater weight to angst and animosity, sadness and fear than they do to the positive human emotions? Indeed, might the field of the history of emotions as a whole suffer from something of a “negative bias,” a tendency to accord greater prominence to the role played by negative emotions in constituting the human past? Consider the titles of a recent, semester-long speakers’ series at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of the History of Emotions in Berlin:¹ “Sorrow carved in stone: Expressions of grief and suffering in Ottoman Muslim<br>

  Author(s) CORRIGAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The practice of emotions history in the field of religious studies has developed apace with the flowering of scholarly interest in everyday practice, embodiment, locality, and the constructed self over the past several decades. Most previous religious history from the earlier twentieth century,¹ whether focused on western monotheisms or on Asian or indigenous religions, was inclined to illustrate its narratives about feeling with ideas collected from theological discourses, or, at the very least, with language sampled from Christian glossaries of belief and worship.² For much religious history, confessional perspectives supplied the basis for interpretation—including the preoccupation with meaning itself<br>

  Author(s) STEARNS PETER N.<br>
  Abstract: The momentum for research in the history of emotions is truly impressive, after the somewhat tentative launch of the field several decades back. Major centers in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany as well as periodic conferences in many other countries demonstrate the growing institutional interest in emotions history. Individual scholars and writers contribute additional vigor, under the emotions history label or more indirectly. A recent study of the modern history of sincerity, calling attention to the important emotional alignments involved, is an intriguing case in point.¹ Emotions history is gaining recognition as an innovative way to improve understanding of<br>

  Abstract: I opened this book with seven scenes of projection to endeavor to open and reeventilize a variety of projection devices: the fossilized fetish instruments of the history of the origins of scientific method; the machine metaphors for the unconscious that risk the danger of not just instrumentalizing the unconscious but converting the unconscious into a scientific object as a transparent and even knowable and predictable object (an empirical positivity for which there need be no analysis, only operations); and the predetermined machine boxes of familiar narratives about the camera obscura as the beginning of a now nostalgic history of photography<br>

  Abstract: In
                  Anti-Oedipus, as is well known, Deleuze and Guattari overthrow the temple of psychoanalysis by knocking out its central pillar—the reactionary conception of desire as lack—and then replace it with the theory of desiring machines, sheer positive productivity that must be coded by the socius, the social production machine. This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince. Not only does it employ the venerable savagery-barbarism-civilization triad, but the proliferating ethnographic references are treated in a seemingly<br>

  Abstract: I begin at the end. I begin in the melancholy and portentous mise-en-scène of the graveyard, the place where the dead lie among the living, where, as Joe Roach provocatively suggests, the tomb functions as a stage on which history is enacted. Roach, who argues that history is a theater of surrogates who stand in place of the dead, makes an intriguing comparison between the grave and performance. “A theatrical role,” he writes, “like a stone effigy on a tomb, has a certain longevity in time, but its special durability stems from the fact that it must be re-fleshed at<br>

  Author(s) Barile Nello<br>
  Abstract: If fashion is a language, albeit one marked by a low semantic level, then accessories can be taken as special indicators of the meaning of clothing. Idiosyncratically arranged, they are able to create both stable structures and variations on a theme. As a starting point I would like to use Mikhail Bakhtin’s concept of “multiaccentuality” and its appropriation by Stuart Hall, who adopts it as a benchmark for his encoding/decoding model.¹ His analysis of these modes of arrangement reveals decisive turning points in the social history of the tie.² Hidden within this accessory, in fact, is a symbolic potential that<br>

  Abstract: It is ironic that Hugo Münsterberg, one of the pioneering intellectual figures in the history of film theory and the philosophy of film, was ignored for the best part of a century, a period during which cinema developed into the defining art form of modern times. Even more striking is that his approach to film theory, already a century ago, was thoroughly steeped in philosophical reflection on the psychological, aesthetic, and cultural significance of the new medium. As a Harvard professor of psychology and philosophy, Münsterberg published

  Author(s) Vacche Angela Dalle<br>
  Abstract: André Bazin was influenced by many philosophical figures. This range of influences was no gratuitous eclecticism. Rather, it stemmed from Bazin’s need to develop a critical discourse that would address the impure ontology of the cinema. Because the medium involves nature and culture, it perforce requires insights into art, religion, science, and technology. Without a doubt, the history of philosophy helped Bazin bring together all these dimensions, even if he seldom identified his sources. As a critic he did not seek a perfect fit between his overall film theory and a single philosopher. Bazin never mentioned the names of Saint<br>

  Author(s) KLEIN JULIE THOMPSON<br>
  Abstract: Debates on digital humanities are sites of boundary work in a history of arguments about the nature of the field. Boundary work is a composite label for the claims, activities, and structures by which individuals and groups create, maintain, break down, and reformulate boundaries between knowledge units (Fisher 13–14; Klein,
                  Crossing1–2). Thomas Gieryn coined the term in 1983 in a study of demarcating science from non-science. It is an ideological style that constructs boundaries rhetorically in three ways: by expanding authority or expertise into domains claimed by other professions or occupations, by monopolizing authority and resources, and<br>

It remains a commonplace not only within art history, but across the humanities in general, that traditional efforts to answer the age-old question “What is art?” are a waste of time at best and an ideological power play at worst. The problem is that a definitive theory of art amounts to a contradiction in terms.

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): MURRAY MARTIN J.<br>
  Abstract: How is the historical past made to appear in the present? In addressing these questions, Murray reveals how collective memory is stored and disseminated in architecture, statuary, monuments and memorials, literature, and art-"landscapes of remembrance" that selectively recall and even fabricate history in the service of nation-building. He examines such vehicles of memory in postapartheid South Africa and parses the stories they tell-stories by turn sanitized, distorted, embellished, and compressed. In this analysis,
      Commemorating and Forgettingmarks a critical move toward recognizing how the legacies and impositions of white minority rule, far from being truly past, remain embedded in, intertwined with, and imprinted on the new nation's here and now.<br>

  Abstract: Heritage and history are like twins separated at birth: while their origins are identical, the trajectories of their distinct life-courses are quite dissimilar. As communicative devices, history and heritage rely on antithetical modes of persuasion. Heritage does not pretend to present a genuinely authentic, and reasonably plausible, account of some past but is a declaration of faith in that which came before.¹ While some observers celebrate heritage as a complementary or alternative way of mediating the past to popular audiences, critics dismiss it as little more than counterfeit history, packaged for commercial consumption.² “While it looks old, heritage is actually<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

                  Being and Time, on the existential analytic of Being-toward-death, constitute one of the most acutely confrontational passages of Heidegger’s formidable book. Bearing spirited witness to this is a long passage in part 3 of Memory, History, Forgetting, devoted to “the historical condition,” in which the philosopher of memory and history considers in his turn the identification of death with “the intimate possibility of one’s ownmost potentiality of being,” and opposes to it “an alternative reading of the potentiality of dying.”¹ However, as Ricœur was writing<br>

Jorge Semprún used it as the epigraph of Literature or Life, which narrates his deportation to Buchenwald in the last year of the war and his “return to life.” Paul Ricœur, who had read Semprún’s book (published in 1994), reprised Malraux’s declaration, as we saw, in Living Up to Death. Neither author assumes the risk of explicitly locating the “region of the soul” that Malraux seeks to reveal, the region where the antagonism between absolute evil and fraternity takes root and is decided.

The Giacometti commission staged an encounter between two different understandings of the way the meeting place is designed. An urban design predicated on the erasure of gesture came up against a sculptural practice that brought to the representation of the human body an antithetical stance. Giacometti reduces the human figure to essential gestures that “communicate directly.” His is a very different aesthetic from the Art Nouveau appreciation of flowing robes and windswept ribbons found in de Clérambault; however, a comparable perception of public space exists.

However, he and she represent a genuine historical vector in the afterlife of colonized countries; and it is a moot point where colonization ends and migration begins, or whether the latter is simply the aestheticization of history.

  Book Title: Agitating Images-Photography against History in Indigenous Siberia<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Craig<br>
  Abstract: Agitating Imagesprovides a glimpse into the first moments of cultural engineering in remote areas of Soviet Siberia. The territories were perceived by outsiders to be on the margins of civilization, replete with shamanic rituals and inhabited by exiles, criminals, and "primitive" indigenous peoples. The Soviets hoped to permanently transform the mythologized landscape by establishing socialist utopian developments designed to incorporate minority cultures into the communist state. This book delves deep into photographic archives from these Soviet programs, but rather than using the photographs to complement an official history, Campbell presents them as anti-illustrations, or intrusions, that confound simple narratives of Soviet bureaucracy and power. Meant to agitate, these images offer critiques that cannot be explained in text alone and, in turn, put into question the nature of photographs as historical artifacts.<br>

  Abstract: Photography in the practice of history and cultural theory has consistently proven to confound interpretation as a generic category. It is apprehended along a spectrum of positions that see it alternately as a transparent reflection of the world and a fabricated cultural text. As I have shown in this book, whatever its ontological status, the photograph is implicated in historical discourses as a significant witness attesting to the everyday. As a resource in the production of historical narrative, it is much like any other document. A photograph, however, is an unstable element when reproduced as a component of historiography. I<br>

On the one side, anterior to and beyond the limits of Australian ‘history’, lies a hazy geo-historical tradition of surmise, a blank sea scored at intervals down the centuries by the prows of dug-outs, out-riggers and, latterly, three-masters; it is a ‘thick horizon’, a rewarding site of myth and speculation. But it lacks substance; cause and effect do not converge in its events, but spread out behind like the wake. After 1788, all is solid. Even the weather seems arrested. In alighting at Botany Bay, Phillip steps out<br>

  Book Title: The Tourist State-Performing Leisure, Liberalism, and Race in New Zealand<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Werry Margaret<br>
  Abstract: Addressing the embodied dimensions of biopolitics and exploring the collision of race, performance, and the cultural poetics of the state, Margaret Werry exposes the real drama behind the new New Zealand. Weaving together interpretive history, performance ethnography, and cultural criticism, Werry offers new ways to think about race and indigeneity—and about the role of human agency in state-making.<br>

  6  Telling Signs of Loss: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttsjb1">Documentary Time</a><br>
  Abstract: For André Bazin, as for Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Roland Barthes, the trace is always a trace
                  ofsomething; the image cannot automatically turn into a sign effect. With reference toCamera LucidaI stressed the semiotic dimension of Barthes’s photo-trace, that is, the importance of extratextual knowledge, the animation through which the image may turn into a trace of the past. Aside from the possibility of novels and film narratives to thematically and symbolically explore the relations between history, memory, and imagination, narration in moving pictures has the means to explore the temporal and mnemonic contingency of photographs,<br>

  Book Title: Telling Identities-The Californio testimonios<br>

  Author(s): Sánchez Rosaura<br>
  Abstract: Sánchez offers the first historical and literary analysis of thirty 1870s testimonios from the original Spanish-speaking settlers of Alta California. Telling Identities scrutinizes the role of gender, class, race, language, and ethnicity in group identity formation as it looks into history to help articulate the cultural politics of contemporary Chicano and Latino culture in the United States.<br>

  1  Testimonials as Dependent Production from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttskkk">Telling Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: In the decade of the 1870s approximately sixty-two old Californios who participated in Bancroft’s historiographic project began mapping their imaginary sense of position within a conquered terrain no longer recoverable except in memory. Through their dictated narratives, which function as early sites of ideological struggle, these Californios not only reconstruct their past and retrospectively narrate the nation, but map a new geopolitical cartography,¹ a liminal ethnic space produced as much by their particular history as by U.S. expansionism.² Having lost their “homeland” and the political and economic power to regain their former social status, the narrators turn to representational spaces,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctttskkk">Telling Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: The spatialization of history evident in the Californio testimonials allows the narrators to position themselves as a collectivity, a caste or a faction within or outside given geographical sites (territory, department, region, nation, mission,

  Abstract: The relationship between memory and history is nowadays a central preoccupation within several fields of the social sciences. Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors. Furthermore, historical knowledge includes interpretive processes, the construction and selection of the “facts,” and the selection of<br>

In doing so, I will partially violate two of the sacred dicta of recent cultural studies: the compulsion to historical specificity and the insistence that all knowledge (and hence all cartographies of that knowledge) is local. Of the first I will say only that in cultural studies today history (disguised perhaps as “culture”) tends to be fetishized as atelos,as a final<br>

  Author(s) Uebel Michael<br>
  Abstract: Every system of thought traces, as if along a Mobius strip, its own system of unthought, and in the process unfolds a history of alterity that reveals how the other, “at once interior and foreign,” has been provisionally unthought, exteriorized, and “shut away (in order to reduce its otherness).”² Though “shut away,” the other is absolutely integral to the selfsame, a necessary parable (Gr.

  Abstract: Translators occupy the smallest print in the history of literature. They are more than the impersonal, they are the anonymous. With few exceptions, the name of the translator appears in small type on the credits page; it rarely appears on the title page, and almost never on the cover.

Although the two nations are treated separately in each chapter in order to highlight individual particularities, comparative allusions are made in order to illustrate the ways Brazil and Portugal impinge upon each other’s respective national identity formation.

  Abstract: While outlining a philosophy of “fine art,” Hegel offered some advice to the nascent discipline of art history. It could be summed up, more or less, as “stick to the facts.” Of course philosophy would forge the aesthetic-theoretical hardwiring of the field. If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned<br>

                  Of Grammatology—probably the work best known to Derrida’s English-speaking audience—looks like a particularly sophisticated variety of psychobiographical analysis, showing the inevitable inscription of the word “supplement”—the word with which Rousseau would name writing, his own writing in relation to speech, and culture in relation to nature—in a larger psychosexual economy (in which it<br>

  Abstract: The burden of the argument to this point has been that philosophy, in response to needs generated within its “own” history, has come to be at necessary odds with its self, its history, and the proprietary self-presence implicit in such notions of self and history. In these straits, philosophy has turned increasingly to criticism for an understanding of its activity, and so has risked also its possible disappearance into literature. Literary criticism and theory thus find themselves in an odd position: a discipline that has a long-established habit of looking elsewhere—primarily to science or philosophy—for models of its<br>

  Abstract: First, some brutal summaries of the French critique of history that perhaps belong in a previous chapter but could also serve as an introduction to this one. To Foucault (1973), history is not the working out of an objective process that the discipline merely reflects but the ground of, that which enables, the modern episteme. Take for instance, biology, a historical discipline if there ever was one: since its object is understood to change through time, it would be impossible without this ground (arche). To Althusser (1997), radically rereading Marx, the historicist notion of time as single/homogenous and continuous is<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the production of a modern nation in Sri Lanka through a process that has been extraordinarily violent in both physical and epistemic terms. I do this primarily through a close analysis of a particular text authored by a former Sri Lankan president whose political career spanned most of the twentieth century, J. R. Jayewardene. If we are the stories we tell about ourselves, Jayewardene’s fable regarding the origins and evolution of Sri Lanka is interesting for the ways in which it produces a sense of identity out of difference.

Any more than the white man” (1967, 231), to indicate the dialectical and mutually constitutive character of ethnicity and nation under the regimes of modernity. Neither nation nor ethnicity is an immanent force, an essence within history, destined for eventual recuperation. Rather, they have to be understood in a relational framework, one that highlights their mutual indispensability and the hierarchizing effects of their interaction (Comaroff 1991).

While Garrison and his white abolitionist colleagues could endorse the past and the future of the American republic as a reference for their public sphere, Douglass had to admit a “quailing sensation” when asked to celebrate the founding of the nation. That history belonged to a “branch of knowledge,” he told his audience, “in which you feel, perhaps, a much deeper interest than your speaker.”¹ Disowning the story of national origins, he called it “the staple of your<br>

The film-maker’s approach recalls that of Alain Resnais in

  Abstract: The discipline of art history has always aimed to do justice to the complexity of works of art in their compelling visuality, taking the relationship between particular works of art and their individual beholders as the field’s primary object of investigation. In this respect, this book is no different from any traditional art historical inquiry. The following essays, however, articulate questions that contemporary art historians generally dismiss as ahistorical or anachronistic or—worse yet—philosophical, implying that “anything goes” when a work of art is approached “philosophically.” In her contribution to this volume, Michael Ann Holly cogently articulates the conundrum<br>

  Abstract: No comparable civilization has argued over definitions of selfhood as much as the Indian. Throughout its long and august history almost every branch of knowledge (including philosophy, literature, religion, and linguistics) has grappled with this extremely elusive concept. There is, however, one point on which all the commentators agree: the self is other than what our faculties persuade us it is. In other words, the construction of the self through social processes (which would require a social other to begin with) is overtaken by a principle in which the “real” or the “true” self comes into being only when it<br>

  Abstract: Gilles Deleuze′s work on the cinema is marked by a grand caesura, not only conceptually (movement-image giving way to time-image) and ″historiographically″ (World War II as the name for the historical moment of this giving way), but also, even,
                  materially. Because this division materializes—one might even go so far as to say ″dramatizes,″ or ″flaunts″—what some consider to be the work′s major flaw, an insufficient grounding in history, one could argue that perhaps this is a deliberate strategy. Perhaps, that is, the ″space″ between the classical cinema and the modern cinema occurs because what happened between the two<br>

  Abstract: Let us set this essay in Beirut, where documentary filmmakers have struggled to reconstruct the traces of the real—should any real still exist—buried under the heavy weight of discursive representations of their city. Beirut has been easily brought into discourse in Europe and North America, too easily, mostly thanks to the television news. In the erstwhile West, there is little sympathy for the complex history of the Lebanese civil war; the country′s history has lapsed and collapsed into clichés, foremost of which is the image of a building shattered by bombs from the Israeli-occupied south.

  Abstract: The inclusion of autobiography in the narrative genre is not as evident as it may seem. By establishing two systems or “two different levels of utterance” (“history” and “discourse”) that concurrently distribute the French verb tenses and grammatical persons, Emile Benveniste (1971) expressly classifies autobiography as discourse, along with “correspondence, memoirs, plays, didactic works, in short, all the genres in which someone addresses himself to someone, proclaims himself as the speaker, and organizes what he says in the category of a person” (209).

  Abstract: At the beginning of the century, the first attempts to go beyond traditional categories of literary research—creation (artistic or literary), originality, inventiveness (where the author is transformed into an epic hero of sorts, admirable and inimitable), influences (as sources or as effective history, the German

On one hand arose the study of aesthetic material, as advocated, for example, by schools of stylistics; on the other, the “abstract objectivism” (as Bakhtin judiciously put it) of Saussurean synchrony and its outgrowth, structuralism.

  Abstract: In Architecture’s Historical Turn, Jorge Otero-Pailos shows how architectural phenomenology radically transformed the way architects engaged, theorized, and produced history. He reveals how, ultimately, the rise of architectural phenomenology played a crucial double role in the rise of postmodernism, creating the antimodern specter of a historical consciousness and offering the modern notion of essential experience as the means to defeat it.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttvjt">Architecture's Historical Turn</a><br>
  Abstract: The nature of architectural phenomenology makes it challenging to historicize. That it presented itself as a new way of doing architectural history requires that one contend with its historiographical conventions without succumbing to them. Yet
                     afterarchitectural phenomenology, it is not possible to simply approach it through the traditional historiographical frameworks it undermined and reconfigured. Its very nature and legacy defy that operation. It disappears under the lenses of architectural histories based on personal biography, self-identified groups, individual schools, institutions, geopolitical borders, or architectural styles.<br>

  EPILOGUE from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.cttttvjt">Architecture's Historical Turn</a><br>
  Abstract: Architectural phenomenology radically transformed architectural historiography, expanding traditional theories of history beyond mere writing conventions to include a more ambiguous experiential intellectual realm expressed through photography, graphic design, camouflage studies, and in short, a wealth of visual techniques imported from architectural practice. Yet the intellectual history of architecture has once again become surprisingly text-centric. Contemporary textbooks and compendia on the history of architectural intellectuality invariably mention phenomenology as a major movement and include the writings of architectural phenomenologists.¹ What is transmitted in these reprints are the words, but not their visual context.

  Abstract: The conclusion to Chapter 7, that “the East” has been cut loose from its geographical point of reference and has become a generalized social marker in European identity formation, is one that may also serve as an initial conclusion to the book as a whole. “The East” is indeed Europe’s other, and it is continuously being recycled in order to represent European identities. Since the “Eastern absence” is a defining trait of “European” identities, there is no use talking about the end of an East/West divide in European history after the end of the Cold War.

  Abstract: There is a range of influences throughout the history of art to which critics and curators refer to bring the Quay Brothers in stylistic proximity with other artists. But in cinema this remains a small group of experimental and auteur filmmakers. Cineastes whom the Quays mention as having had a particular influence on them are Aleksandr Dovzhenko, Robert Bresson, Theodor Dreyer, Georges Franju, Charles Bokanowski, Andrei Tarkovsky, Aleksandr Sokurov, and others. All of these filmmakers are noted for their unusual poetics of lighting, mise-en-scène, and camera. The influences of impressionist cinema and especially surrealism are evident in some of the<br>

The term “logocentrism” clearly bears a great burden inOf Grammatology. Derrida gives three dimensions of this burden: (1) The phonetization of writing, which has often enough been hailed as a great advance of civilization, “must dissimulate its own history as it is produced” (OG, 11/3), thus bearing the dark side of dissimulation as the condition of its own apparent worth.

  Book Title: Counter-Archive-Film, the Everyday, and Albert Kahn's Archives de la Planète<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): AMAD PAULA<br>
  Abstract: Tucked away in a garden on the edge of Paris is a multimedia archive like no other: Albert Kahn's
      Archives de la Planète(1908-1931). Kahn's vast photo-cinematographic experiment preserved world memory through the privileged lens of everyday life, andCounter-Archivesituates this project in its biographic, intellectual, and cinematic contexts. Tracing the archive's key influences, such as the philosopher Henri Bergson, the geographer Jean Brunhes, and the biologist Jean Comandon, Paula Amad maps an alternative landscape of French cultural modernity in which vitalist philosophy cross-pollinated with early film theory, documentary film with the avant-garde, cinematic models of temporality with the early Annales school of history, and film's appropriation of the planet with human geography and colonial ideology. At the heart of the book is an insightful meditation upon the transformed concept of the archive in the age of cinema and an innovative argument about film's counter-archival challenge to history. The first comprehensive study of Kahn's films,Counter-Archivealso offers a vital historical perspective on debates involving archives, media, and memory.<br>

  Book Title: Reclaiming the Enlightenment-Toward a Politics of Radical Engagement<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRONNER STEPHEN ERIC<br>
  Abstract: This book tackles an obvious yet profound problem of modern political life: the disorientation of intellectuals and activists on the left. As the study of political history and theory has been usurped by cultural criticism, a confusion over the origins and objectives of progressive politics has been the result. Specifically, it has become fashionable for intellectuals to attack the Enlightenment for its imperialism, eurocentrism, and scientism, and for the sexism and racism of some of its major representatives. Although the fact that individual thinkers harbored such prejudices is irrefutable, Stephen Bronner argues that reducing the Enlightenment ethos to these beliefs is wholly unsustainable.<br>

  Author(s) HONNETH AXEL<br>
  Abstract: It would be nearly impossible to describe the concerns Habermas articulates and addresses in his theory without referring to the three intellectual traditions named above. All his innovations—indeed, the motivational bases for his project as a whole—are so strongly shaped by the philosophy of history, philosophical anthropology, and Marxism that even the attenuated presence of these traditions in his later writings cannot conceal how much, in changed form, they have always determined his work. The following brief sketch will provide a kind of archeology of Habermas’s social philosophy in its mature phase and make plain the theoretical elements<br>

  27  THE THEORY OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE: from:

  Author(s) FRASER NANCY<br>
  Abstract: The public sphere is the most influential of Jürgen Habermas’s signature concepts. Unlike “communicative action,” “discourse ethics,” and “the colonization of the lifeworld,” which are discussed principally by specialists, this concept has become a major focus of work in fields ranging from history, law, politics, and sociology to literature, philosophy, gender studies, and media studies. Designating a central institution of modern society, one that previously lacked a name, Habermas’s concept of the public sphere enjoys a status akin to that of a scientific discovery.

  Abstract: Key to the social philosophy of Jürgen Habermas is his deeply held conviction that social evolution represents a history of progress in principle while at the same time—and as a matter of actual fact—being the cause of grave social ills. His project is shaped, then, by an awareness of suffering and crisis—matters that do not even occur to neoconservative and neoliberal modernizers, entranced as they are by technical and economic development. Simultaneously, he maintains critical distance from parties who, when faced with the catastrophes that modernity has produced, take flight for archaic utopias. In fleshing out this<br>

  Abstract: Habermas’s engagement with the questions posed by anthropology began during his university studies—when he evinced skepticism about efforts to determine the unchanging qualities of human nature. He presented his reflections in an encyclopedia article (1958) that received broad attention at the time. According to Otfried Höffe (1992), this piece is responsible for the hegemony of “postanthropological thinking” that prevailed in the “human sciences” until the 1990s (7). In keeping with the conventions of the genre, the first part of Habermas’s encyclopedia entry provides an introductory overview of the history and essential concepts of anthropological thought; the second part, however,<br>

  Abstract: The theory of historical materialism developed by Marx and Engels understands social conditions as the result of a teleological historical process. The analysis of operative categories—forces of production, relations of production, and superstructure—permit the further course of history to be explained and even predicted. As outlined in Marx’s
                  Grundrisse(Marx 1993), the model of historical materialism is as follows: Forces of production (i.e., the labor of persons who are active in production, the specialized knowledge that manages/directs their efforts, the tools employed, and instruments/instances of certification and coordination) give rise to institutions and mechanisms that determine who has<br>

  Abstract: A “person’s self,” Christopher Bollas writes, “is the history of many internal relations”: “infant, child, adolescent and adult” (9). These relations link us to our pasts but also to the classes in which others place us—to ideas about youth and adulthood, men and women, parents and children. Richard Flynn writes that Jarrell “fused his theory of child development with a theory of poetic development” (
                  Lost 102). Childhood becomes for Jarrell a symbol of the kinds of value he found in the self: those kinds of value can appear as “play,” as creativity, and as ways of resisting fixed institutions<br>

  Author(s) RIOT-SARCEY MICHÈLE<br>
  Abstract: Uopia unsettles. Even in the writing of history one has tried to sort out impossible reforms from signs of progress, the illuminism of the former from the realism of the latter. As Miguel Abensour underlines concerning the Marxist critique of utopias, “the critique of utopia is situated at the culmination of a real theoretical revolution—the production of a theory of history,”¹ and, whatever the political options or ideological choices of historians, this critique strongly marked the schools of historiography. Utopia in the doctrinal sense is itself a partial criticism of society, incomplete and, by the same token, unable to<br>

  Author(s) CHROSTOWSKA S. D.<br>
  Abstract: Our problematic in this volume on the “uses of utopia for politics” brings together what commonly comes in separate packages. To be sure, mainstream readings of modern Western political history support the attribution of a utopian dimension to left–radical politics, and, conversely, of radical, if covert, political motives to utopia. The historic conflation of utopianism and political radicalism does not, however, explain the internal crisis of the Left any more than it explains today’s generalized political apathy. Neither does it absolve this apathy’s dispirited sufferers of their tendency to equate legitimate politics with a crude, calculating realism, one that<br>

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

In animal species the self only exists, at most, as sexual preening. What they have is a primitive sympathetic reaction, which sometimes occurs in man too, but only episodically.

  Author(s) HADDAD SAMIR<br>
  Abstract: There was no debate. There never was a moment when Derrida and Foucault were sitting opposite each other, on display for an audience, arguing back and forth, controlled by a mediator or provoked by a journalist. There can be no images, no transcript. Of course, the history of philosophy is full of debates whose reality and vitality does not depend on an empirical encounter of the sort Foucault had with Chomsky: writers and readers frequently proceed by staging two authors as figures to stake out opposing positions. But the strange quarrel explored in these essays is not quite of that<br>

  Abstract: Essays feature close readings of both familiar and lesser known materials, offering provocative interpretations of John of Rupescissa's alchemy; the relationship between the living and the saintly dead in Bernard of Clairvaux's sermons; the nomenclature of heresy in the early eleventh century; the apocalyptic visions of Robert of Uzès; Machiavelli's
      De principatibus; the role of "demotic religiosity" in economic development; and the visions of Elizabeth of Schönau. Contributors write as historians of religion, art, literature, culture, and society, approaching their subjects through the particular and the singular rather than through the thematic and the theoretical. Playing with the wild possibilities of the historical fragments at their disposal, the scholars in this collection advance a new and exciting approach to writing medieval history.<br>

  Author(s) Gragnolati Manuele<br>
  Abstract: One of the reasons Dante’s magnum opus is called a “comedy” is its use of a comic register as the leading one. This choice forms the basis of the poem’s capability to encompass reality in all its spectra and to combine, for instance, myth with fragments of everyday life and chronicle, theoretical speculation with personal issues and political tirades, sublime love poetry with debased language, mystical ardor with spiteful irony. Like life or history, Dante’s

  Author(s): BARNARD TIMOTHY<br>
  Abstract: The authors begin with an overview of the extreme positions held by opposing camps in the debate over cinema: the "digitalphobes" who lament the implosion of cinema and the "digitalphiles" who celebrate its new, vital incarnation. Throughout, they remind readers that cinema has never been a static medium but a series of processes and transformations powering a dynamic art. From their perspective, the digital revolution is the eighth major crisis in the history of motion pictures, with more disruptions to come. Brokering a peace among all sides, Gaudreault and Marion emphasize the cultural practice of cinema over rigid claims on its identity, moving toward a common conception of cinema to better understand where it is headed next.<br>

  Book Title: Eastwood's Iwo Jima-Critical Engagements with<br>
  Publisher: Wallflower Press<br>
  Author(s): GJELSVIK ANNE<br>
  Abstract: With
      Flags of Our Fathers(2006) andLetters from Iwo Jima(2006), Clint Eastwood made a unique contribution to film history, being the first director to make two films about the same event. Eastwood's films examine the battle over Iwo Jima from two nations' perspectives, in two languages, and embody a passionate view on conflict, enemies, and heroes. Together these works tell the story behind one of history's most famous photographs, Leo Rosenthal's "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima." In this volume, international scholars in political science and film, literary, and cultural studies undertake multifaceted investigations into how Eastwood's diptych reflects war today. Fifteen essays explore the intersection among war films, American history, and Japanese patriotism. They present global attitudes toward war memories, icons, and heroism while offering new perspectives on cinema, photography, journalism, ethics, propaganda, war strategy, leadership, and the war on terror.<br>

  Abstract: Taken together, Eastwood’s diptych 
                  Flags of Our Fathers (2006) and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) form a unique contribution to film history. It was the first time a director made two films at the same time about the same event, which here is the battle over Iwo Jima in 1945 during World War II. And it was also the first time an American director made an American film in Japanese, since Letters from Iwo Jima (despite its English title) is entirely in Japanese. Finally, and what motivated us to produce this anthology, it was the first time a director touched<br>

  BEYOND MIMESIS: from:

  Author(s) PÖTZSCH HOLGER<br>
  Abstract: It is a defining feature of war stories that issues of memory and history strangely intersect. War stories are often the stories of individual soldiers. However, due to the peculiar nature of their content relating to major collective endeavours, suffering and sacrifice, these stories quickly adopt major significance for the self-perception and self-legitimisation of collectives. Initially published as memoires, or historical novels written by men directly involved in the events under consideration, many of the tales are subsequently adapted to screen. As movies ‘based on true stories’, they reach far greater audiences and become important instruments for the social construction<br>

  Book Title: Regimes of Historicity-Presentism and Experiences of Time<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): BROWN SASKIA<br>
  Abstract: Our presentist present is by no means uniform or clear-cut, and it is experienced very differently depending on the position we occupy in society. We are caught up in global movement and accelerated flows, or else condemned to the life of casual workers, living from hand to mouth in a stagnant present, with no recognized past, and no real future either (since the temporality of plans and projects is inaccessible). The present is therefore experienced as emancipation or enclosure, and the perspective of the future is no longer reassuring, since it is perceived not as a promise, but as a threat. Hartog's resonant readings show us how the motor of history(-writing) has stalled and help us understand the contradictory qualities of our contemporary presentist relation to time.<br>

  1  MAKING HISTORY: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/hart16376">Regimes of Historicity</a><br>
  Abstract: In a lecture significantly entitled “Other Times, Other Customs: The Anthropology of History,” Marshall Sahlins evoked Jean-Paul Sartre’s question of whether we are yet able “to constitute a structural, historical anthropology.” Sahlins’s response was unequivocal: “Yes, I have tried to suggest here,
                  le jour est arrivé” (in French in Sahlins). In other words, the day had dawned when one could “explode the concept of history through the anthropological experience of culture.”¹ Taking my cue from this, I will start with this anthropological experience of culture, guided by Sahlins, whose lecture sought to bring that “day” into being, or at least<br>

  Abstract: Anyone transported directly from the Pacific to the Aegean, from the world of royal kingship to the “world of Odysseus,” moving simultaneously through space and back in time, would have no difficulty recognizing in the Homeric hero certain characteristics of the heroic regime of history. But it would be a different type of heroic regime, one incarnated by Achilles and Odysseus, as Vico describes them. Anyway, I do not intend to compare Thakombau or Hone Heke with Agamemnon or Nestor, and list similarities and differences, but rather focus on one figure in particular, Odysseus.

  Abstract: “France must compose its Annals afresh, to make them conform to the progress of reason.” This maxim from Chateaubriand, which we referred to in the last chapter, comes from the preface to his
                  Historical Studies, in which he was adopting the pose of the historian overtaken by history: “I was writing ancient history, while modern history was knocking at my door.”¹ History, speeding ahead posthaste, was once again leaving him behind. As he observed in hisMemoirs, ideally one would “write history in a calèche.” Lorenz von Stein, a German theorist of history, noted similarly in 1843 that “it is<br>

  Abstract: Throughout its long history the idea of cosmopolitanism has never known such success as in the last two decades. We can postulate four reasons for this. The first was a widespread sense, captured in the word 
                  globalization, that the accelerating movements of people, money, goods, technologies, images, and ideas beyond national frontiers had crossed a threshold. Nearly all observers perceived a qualitative change in the way and the extent to which people related to, affected, and depended on one another across borders: the world seemed to be becoming “more global”—interconnected, interdependent, and, in this sense, unified.

  Abstract: To this point my discussion has been mainly negative, focusing on various ways in which the cosmopolitan commitment to egalitarian universalism goes astray. My survey of the history of Western cosmopolitanisms in chapter 1 showed how they have always reflected the conditions of their emergence, mirroring or reproducing the social, cultural, ideological, and political contexts from and against which they arose. In chapter 2 I depicted moral-ethical cosmopolitanisms as afflicted by a double bind. On the one hand, like Rawls’s theory of justice, they tend to lose their critical force by abstracting from existing social-political conditions and cultural values; yet,<br>

  1  THE RETURN OF PIRATES IN THE GLOBAL ERA from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/inne17060">Governance in the New Global Disorder</a><br>
  Abstract: In his famous book
                  The History of Piracy, Philip Gosse (1989 [1932], 298) recalls that people, at the end of the nineteenth century, believed the disappearance of pirates was imminent. It was the dream of a world where there is no territory without sovereignty, in other words, no one distanced from the rules of the state (Thompson 1994; Anderson 1997). Subsequent history seems to flatly disprove this prediction. Piracy has stopped being a historical curiosity or a simple metaphor. Pirates are among us and taking on diverse forms in many different realms: pirates of the air and seas, radio pirates,<br>

  Book Title: Harmattan-A Philosophical Fiction<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): JACKSON MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: Evoking the hot, dust-filled Harmattan winds that blow from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea, this book creatively explores what it means to be buffeted by the unforeseen and the unknown. Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,
      Harmattanconnects existential vitality to the act of resisting prescribed customs and questioning received notions of truth. At the book's heart is the fictional story of Tom Lannon, a graduate student from Cambridge University, who remains ambivalent about pursuing a conventional life. After traveling to Sierra Leone in the aftermath of its devastating civil war, Tom meets a writer who helps him explore the possibilities of renewal. Illustrating the fact that certain aspects of human existence are common to all people regardless of culture and history,Harmattanremakes the distinction between home and world and the relationship between knowledge and life.<br>

  Abstract: The Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, one of the finest intellectual commentators on Western culture and religion, has written widely on political philosophy, theories of social science, and the history of philosophy.

  Book Title: Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon-A History of the Internationalization of Communal Conflict<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Khalaf Samir<br>
  Abstract: Khalaf concludes that Lebanon is now at a crossroads in its process of political and social transformation, and proposes some strategies to re-create a vibrant civil and political culture that can accommodate profound transformations in the internal, domestic sphere as well as mediate developments taking place internationally. Throughout, Khalaf demonstrates how the internal and external currents must be considered simultaneously in order to understand the complex and tragic history of the country. This deeply considered and subtle analysis of the interplay of complex historical forces helps us to imagine a viable future not only for Lebanon but also for the Middle East as a whole.<br>

  Abstract: The social and political history of Lebanon—despite occasional manifestations of consensus, balance and harmony—has always been characterized by successive outbursts of civil strife and political violence. The brutality and duration of almost two decades of senseless bloodletting might have obscured some of the earlier episodes. Consequently, observers are often unaware that much of Lebanon’s history is essentially a history of intermittent violence. Dramatic episodes such as the peasant uprisings of 1820, 1840, and 1857 and the repeated outbreaks of sectarian hostilities in 1841, 1845, 1860, 1958, and the protracted civil war of 1975–92, reveal, if anything, the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/khal12476">Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon</a><br>
  Abstract: A defining element in Lebanon’s checkered sociopolitical history, one that has had substantive implications for the character and magnitude of collective strife, is the survival and reassertion of communal solidarities. In fact, the three overarching and persisting features—(1) foreign intervention, (2) the reawakening of primordial identities, and (3) the escalation of protracted violence—are all intimately related. This is, after all, what informs the major thrust of this study. We will, in subsequent chapters, identify and account for the various forms foreign intervention has assumed. More explicitly, an effort will be made to explore how the unresolved regional and<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/khal12476">Civil and Uncivil Violence in Lebanon</a><br>
  Abstract: The brief interlude between the relatively benign civil war of 1958 and the protracted cruelties of 1975 stands out as a perplexing often anomalous epoch in Lebanon’s eventful political history. It is a period marked by sustained political stability, economic prosperity, and swift societal transformations, the closest the country ever got to a “golden age” with all the outward manifestations of stupendous vitality, exuberance, and rising expectations. But these were also times of growing disparities, cleavages, neglect, portends perhaps of a more “gilded age” of misdirected and uneven growth, boisterous political culture, conspicuous consumption, and the trappings of frivolous life-style<br>

  Abstract: Throughout its checkered history, Lebanon’s enigmatic, Janus-like character has never ceased to baffle. It has been a source of bewilderment, as we have seen, to both its detractors and admirers. A few of those struck by its perplexities have been candid enough to caution against facile analysis and hasty inferences. Two veteran observers, separated by more than two decades of eventful history, advance almost the same sobering caveats. Writing in 1963, to account for the “seeming vitality and durability of the country’s confessional democracy,” J. C.

  Abstract: For almost two decades, Lebanon was besieged and beleaguered by every possible form of brutality and collective terror known to human history: from the cruelties of factional and religious bigotry to the massive devastations wrought by private militias and state-sponsored armies. They have all generated an endless carnage of innocent victims and an immeasurable toll in human suffering. Even by the most moderate of estimates, the magnitude of such damage to human life and property is staggering. About 170,000 people have perished; twice as many were wounded or disabled; close to two thirds of the population experienced some from of<br>

  Abstract: This study is predicated on the overarching premise that much of the 
                     displaced and protracted character of collective strife that has beleaguered Lebanon at various interludes could well be a reflection of two other constant features of its fractious political history; namely the radicalization of communal solidarities and the unsettling, often insidious, character of foreign intervention. By probing further into the nature of this interplay one, it is hoped, can better understand when, how and why social strife becomes more belligerent and assumes some of the menacing cruelties of uncivil violence.<br>

  Abstract: This theory of evil has highlighted what we can learn from catastrophes. Such a statement, however, does not mean that I can claim there has been progress in history. Rather, it means, as was Habermas’s main intention when he coined the concept, that there always exists the possibility of creating another side to the story of evil. This dynamic dialectic should allow us to situate ourselves beyond the paradigm of total despair (the apocalyptic), and beyond the naïve idea that modernity can still entirely hold the pure promise of enlightenment without a critical examination of past atrocities.

Gadamer’s development of hermeneutics as an interpretive method of theories and traditions proved fruitful for many areas of social knowledge.¹ The major contribution of hermeneutics is its ability to articulate the relationship between language and history as traditions. After the linguistic turn, the English school of the history of political theory, exemplified by Quentin Skinner,² developed its own versions of<br>

  Abstract: In previous chapters I have often referred to Reinhart Koselleck’s work, especially his method of conceptual history, which I consistently find useful with regard to questions of translation and innovation in the emergence of secularized forms of political concepts. Koselleck is also helpful for understanding the dynamic feedback between the formulation of a concept and the social reality that creates the space in which the concept is accepted and used. In this chapter I will focus on Koselleck’s largely negative assessment of the ways in which the problem of politics versus morality has been addressed in Enlightenment thought. Koselleck’s model<br>

I argue that his formulation of a new political concept of justice as social inclusion can be interpreted as a disclosive model of new political relationships. I will also discuss some of Habermas’s more recent essays about translating religious contents into the public sphere, in which he addresses issues I have been dealing with in this book.¹ I will also analyze his latest efforts to radicalize his ideas<br>

  Author(s) SHIAW-CHIAN FONG<br>
  Abstract: Prior to the 1990s, the story of colonial Taiwan under Japanese rule was rarely heard in the English-speaking world; it also lacked an audience in Taiwan itself. With its democratization, which also removed pan-Chinese ideology, people on the island began to show interest in their own history. A space was thus created in which colonial experience could be researched and its stories told. However, since the time for intensive research has been relatively short thus far, the stories of both the colonizer and the colonized, particularly in regard to cultural domains, remain rudimentary, and not entirely precise in many details.<br>

  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I continue to trace the movement of cultural translation designated by the term “Sikh theology” into the humanities program of the modern Western university, specifically the discourse of the history of religions. To do this it is necessary to determine how the subject of Sikhism, or the Sikh subject, came to be determined as a distinctly “religious” subject. I argue that a certain understanding of violence, or, rather, a set of unexamined assumptions about the relationship between religion and violence, is necessary for the construction and deployment of this subject as “religious” in the modern academic study<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/nast16744">Contemporary Romanian Cinema</a><br>
  Abstract: Romaniaʹs break from Communist dictatorship engendered by the 1989 revolutionary moment was obviously different from similar phenomena going on in most East European countries. Most importantly, it was almost entirely and sometimes excessively filmed by professional film and television crews and by numerous amateur cameras. In Ricoeurʹs terms,
                  time of fictionandhistorical timefor once coincided (Ricoeur 1990, III: 129). Such a situation had very long-term effects on the future history of Romanian cinema. These effects were felt in the early documentaries, domestic and foreign docu-fictions, shorts and feature-length films of the early 1990s and followed their trajectory through<br>

  Book Title: A Hedonist Manifesto-The Power to Exist<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): McClellan Joseph<br>
  Abstract: Michael Onfray passionately defends the potential of hedonism to resolve the dislocations and disconnections of our melancholy age. In a sweeping survey of history's engagement with and rejection of the body, he exposes the sterile conventions that prevent us from realizing a more immediate, ethical, and embodied life. He then lays the groundwork for both a radical and constructive politics of the body that adds to debates over morality, equality, sexual relations, and social engagement, demonstrating how philosophy, and not just modern scientism, can contribute to a humanistic ethics.<br>

  ONE  A Philosophical Side Path from:

  Abstract: Classical historiography of philosophy is constructed by wishful thinking. Strangely, the apostles of pure reason and transcendental deduction all agree in the mythology that they create and that they perpetuate with a vengeance by teaching, compiling, lecturing, writing, and publishing fables. Through repetition, these become gospel truths. Scholarly looting, unmarked citation, conceptual regurgitation of other’s work—these are the happy practices of those who edit encyclopedias, conceive lexicons, and otherwise write the history of philosophy and the textbooks in which it is inscribed.<br>

  Abstract: Other powerful lineages populate the history of philosophy. There are other binaries to describe the issues and people at work in the tradition. Of course, there is Idealism and Materialism; the ascetic Ideal and the hedonist Ideal; and transcendence and immanence. But equally, there is denigration of the “I” and writing about the self. On the one hand, the philosophers I have listed did not seem to value autobiographical confession or little details derived from personal experiences. On the other hand, their lives fed their thought and they acknowledged drawing lessons from life. Some are messengers who efface themselves, trying<br>

  Abstract: Some clever people, camping out in their aesthetic marketplaces and doing their philosophical commerce, actually think that a history of art is possible … As long as you keep it concise! They dissertate about concepts divorced from any context; they gloss, like Plato’s contemporaries, ideas about Beauty-in-itself, the essence of Beauty, ineffable and unspeakable Beauty, or Beauty as a vector of transcendence; that is, they insist on the truth of its existence. From it, they can derive God, who they carefully guard from danger. They get a great deal out of a schema that is so philosophically easy.<br>

  Abstract: “It is characteristic of philosophical writing that it must continually confront the question of 
                  Darstellung.” This—the opening sentence of the “Epistemo-Critical Prologue” to The Origin of German Tragic Drama—is arguably the most important and philosophically freighted sentence in the entire Benjaminian oeuvre. In quoting it in English translation I have left the original Darstellung, because the way this particular word—with a long history in German philosophy and aesthetics—is translated at once raises and potentially begs many questions: is it better translated as “representation” or as “presentation”? The published translation has “representation,” which does indeed correspond to<br>

Working from Church documents, popular Catholic periodicals, and interviews with the devout, Orsi weaves, in the first six chapters of the book, a rich social history of the cult and tells a story. The basic plot is this: “in desperate circumstances [the devout] prayed to St. Jude and . . . something good happened for them.”³ Or, to put it in Orsi’s academic terms, when crisis put these women in “desperate circumstances,” their devotion to St.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/robe14752">Encountering Religion</a><br>
  Abstract: Kenneth Reinhard, commenting on Benjamin’s view of history, writes that “redemption is the not the final cause of history, but the interruption of the false totality of historical causality and contextualization by acts of 
                  critical creation and constellation.”² Such “acts” are at the heart of a conception of humanistic cultural criticism that I find opened up by de Vries, Santner, and, as I will argue in this chapter, Stanley Cavell. Such criticism depends on a distinction between historicist views of causality and context that, in locativist fashion, put the events of the past in their place, and “remembrance” as a<br>

It has survived thanks in part to the scribes who were charged along the way with copying it (palm-leaf manuscripts do not hold up indefinitely in the Sri Lankan climate). It survived the early translation performed by George Turnour and the consequent attention it garnered from Western Orientalists. And it survived through numerous other intervening interpretations, finally making its way into the hands of modern interpretive communities and scholars alike. Modern scholars must be grateful to all these scribes and<br>

  Abstract: Credited by most recent discussions on the university as one of the central figures in the origins of the academic study of English, Matthew Arnold has helped to contribute and define many of the key terms still used in the analysis of literature. Arnold’s identification of the two distinctive forces behind Western culture’s continuing development in his seminal

The events of the past, both distant and more recent, posed a special challenge to the rabbis and Milton. With few exceptions, these events marked painful losses: the destruction of the Temple and the ensuing loss of political power within the Roman Empire on the one hand, the Restoration of the English monarchy and the disempowerment of more radical embodiments of Protestantism on the other.

  Epilogue: from:

                  Paradise Lost and the rabbinic fantasy of Moses’s visit to the bet midrash of R. Akiba. Both mountaintop scenes render complex perspectives on history, politics, belief, and human agency. These two scenes of instruction offer useful insights into one another, but Milton’s portrayal of Michael’s postlapsarian instructions to Adam has for its precursor a more explicit biblical account of divinely granted vistas, Moses’s Pisgah sight, just before his death, in Deuteronomy 34.¹ Anticipating Milton’s own reworking of this culminating biblical episode,<br>

  Book Title: The Death of Philosophy-Reference and Self-reference in Contemporary Thought<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LYNCH RICHARD A.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophers debate the death of philosophy as much as they debate the death of God. Kant claimed responsibility for both philosophy's beginning and end, while Heidegger argued it concluded with Nietzsche. In the twentieth century, figures as diverse as John Austin and Richard Rorty have proclaimed philosophy's end, with some even calling for the advent of "postphilosophy." In an effort to make sense of these conflicting positions-which often say as much about the philosopher as his subject-Isabelle Thomas-Fogiel undertakes the first systematic treatment of "the end of philosophy," while also recasting the history of western thought itself.<br>

On this point, the first required trait (namely, the affirmation of philosophy as a science in the face of a devastating skepticism) is superbly embodied by the dispute between Plato and the Sophists. Similarly, many of Aristotle’s arguments could be taken up against contemporary skepticism. And again, the theme of philosophy as a<br>

The past ceased to appear as an immense reservoir of experiences from which human beings could draw moral and political lessons. Since the French Revolution, the future had to be invented rather than extracted from bygone events.

  Abstract: The history of socialism is a constellation of defeats that nourished it for almost two centuries. Instead of destroying its ideas and aspirations, these traumatic, tragic, often bloody defeats consolidated and legitimated them. Falling after a well-fought struggle gives dignity to the vanquished and can become a source of pride. Exiled and banished revolutionaries often knew misery and privations, certainly the sufferings of loss, but rarely isolation among the people surrounding them. They always occupied a place of honor within the left and socialist movements, from Heine, Marx, and Herzen in nineteenth-century Paris to the anti fascist émigrés in twentieth-century<br>

  Abstract: At first sight, Marxism and memory appear as two foreign continents. Since Marx, many scholars belonging to his intellectual tradition have elaborated philosophies of history or investigated historical temporalities—E. P. Thompson’s studies on time and work discipline in early industrial capitalism are the most known—but have never conceptualized collective remembrance. Opened one century ago by Henri Bergson and Maurice Halbwachs, the scholarly debate on memory deeply shaped sociology, historiography, and philosophy without receiving any significant Marxist contribution. The rare assessments made by Marxist scholars on this topic simply reproduce a classical, positivistic dichotomy between history and memory: memory<br>

When it meets a vulture’s beak, it matters very little if this flesh, this meat, was once a human or some other kind of animal.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Author(s) Storch Tanya<br>
  Abstract: It can be argued that the proper history of the Chinese Buddhist canon begins with its printed editions because the printed format allows for easier access, wider dissemination, standardization of the contents, and preservation of textual stability. But before the earliest printed editions appeared, for a period of more than five hundred years, Chinese scholars zealously labored over the creation of the principles of textual criticism and taxonomic organization, which they applied to the handwritten canon and which eventually affected the contents and structure of the printed version. In the canon catalogs, various manuscripts of translated Buddhist texts, as well<br>

  Abstract: In his particular effort to justify the ways of God to man, Milton knows full well that it is not sufficient merely to demonstrate the proper origin of evil, though a satisfactory treatment of the subject that has so exercised some of the best minds throughout Christian history is itself no mean or easy accomplishment. In order to magnify the seriousness of the Fall and its terrible consequences, Milton, like most Christian apologists since Ambrose, realizes the value of emphasizing the original perfection of the first couple.

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Sixth Century B.C.E. to Seventeenth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Yü Ying-shih's perspective, the Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on the
      Dao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 1 ofChinese History and Cultureexplores how theDaowas reformulated, expanded, defended, and preserved by Chinese intellectuals up to the seventeenth century, guiding them through history's darkest turns. Essays incorporate the evolving conception of the soul and the afterlife in pre- and post-Buddhist China, the significance of eating practices and social etiquette, the move toward greater individualism, the rise of the Neo-Daoist movement, the spread of Confucian ethics, and the growth of merchant culture and capitalism. A true panorama of Chinese culture's continuities and transition, Yü Ying-shih's two-volume Chinese History and Culture gives readers of all backgrounds a unique education in the meaning of Chinese civilization.<br>

  Abstract: Both “individualism” and “holism” are Western concepts whose introduction into Chinese intellectual discourse is a matter of only recent historical development.¹ This does not mean, however, that as categories of analy sis these two concepts are totally inapplicable to the study of early Chinese thought. As a matter of fact, we find in the long history of Chinese political and social thought a wide range of views that can be legitimately characterized as either holistic or individualistic.

  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/yu--17860">Chinese History and Culture</a><br>
  Abstract: Dai Zhen 戴震 (1724–1777) presents two entirely different images in the intellectual history of the mid-Qing Period: that of a classical philologist and that of a Confucian philosopher. During his own time, it was Dai the philologist who received universal recognition in the scholarly world. On the other hand, Dai the philosopher was largely ignored or even denounced by his contemporaries. Zhang Xuecheng’s 章學誠 (1738–1801) great appreciation of Dai’s philosophical writings was not shared at all by such common friends as Zhu Yun 朱筠 (1729–1781) and Shao Jinhan 邵晉涵 (1743–1796).

  Abstract: The concept of “national history” in its current Western usage was wholly unfamiliar to Chinese historians before the twentieth century. This was primarily because there was no notion of “nation” in traditional Chinese political parlance. A most revealing illustration may be found in a conversation between a Chinese official and a British trade representative in Canton prior to the outbreak of the Opium War in 1839. The official is reported to have been at a complete loss when the trade representative referred to China as a “nation.”¹ Even after the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, many high-ranking Chinese officials at<br>

  Abstract: With a historiographical tradition as long and variegated as China’s, any attempt at a sweeping generalization of Chinese historical thought with a view to clearly distinguishing it from its Western counterpart is hazardous. To suggest that there are essential determinate characteristics in Chinese historiography that are wholly absent in the West is to lapse into a false essentialism. The more I know about the history of Western historiography, the less I am sure about the possibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the two traditions. As far as the individual component parts of Chinese and Western historiographies are concerned, they<br>

  Abstract: The word “sense,” as any thesaurus shows, is synonymous with (a) meaning, significance, logic; (b) intelligence, wisdom, common sense; and (c) feeling, sensation, awareness. It is the same word, yet it carries very different, even opposing, meanings. Characterizing the history of anthropological theory as a quest for finding the sense of the behaviors of fellow human beings, Michael Herzfeld argues (2001) that theories were engaged first in “making sense” of the behaviors of “exotic others”; then in studying the “common sense” or taken-for-granted realities of different groups within a society (including those of the anthropologist); and now are focusing on<br>

  Book Title: The Last Cannibals-A South American Oral History<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: An anthropological understanding of the history of a people without writing, which will necessarily be communicated orally, must be effected both with respect to their particular ways of remembering and understanding events and to how they communicate this understanding and memory within one or another speech genre. Thus, for example, if we are to know how people construct an awareness of historical processes, we must learn why certain events have become memorable, how they are given explanatory meaning, and how they are integrated into earlier life experiences. History has an explanatory or clarifying function which is inherent in its constant<br>

  Abstract: Fernández organizes episodes in the history of Mexican art and architecture, ranging from the seventeenth century to the end of the twentieth century, around the consistent but unacknowledged historical theme of cosmopolitanism, allowing readers to discern relationships among various historical periods and works that are new and yet simultaneously dependent on their predecessors. She uses case studies of art and architecture produced in response to government commissions to demonstrate that established visual forms and meanings in Mexican art reflect and inform desires, expectations, memories, and ways of being in the world-in short, that visual culture and cosmopolitanism are fundamental to processes of subjectification and identity.<br>

  Abstract: Archaeological remains are more than traces of civilizations past. Like other sites of nation-building they serve as stages for the contestation of multiple interests. Official histories, tourist literature, art history, and archaeology often obscure these tensions by focusing on the impressive materiality of the monuments and on deciphering their original significance (Fig. 4.1). While these efforts illuminate our knowledge of the past, they leave out aggregates of individual and collective experiences that also contribute to the signification of the works. Ancient monuments belong to places. As E. V. Walters argued, the significance of a place is inaccessible through rational processes<br>

Technologies such as telephones, electric lighting, automobiles, cinema, and radio; industrial materials such as glass, steel, and cement; modern building styles, air travel, and television were disseminated to a wider proportion of society than in the preceding century.¹ These technologies enabled flows actual and imaginary between Mexico and the outside and extensively shaped Mexico’s cosmopolitanism.

The former was an avantgardist known for light, cool, geometricized structures that explored the limits of modernist tropes of abstraction, technology, and space. The latter created exuberant, allusive, symbolically charged monuments, often rustically hand-carved out of stone, which evoked a distant history rather than projecting the visions of a brave future.

This reform marked an endorsement of previous calls for change from theologians, liturgy scholars, and ordinary priests around the world; known as the Liturgical Movement, it now has a well-documented historical narrative.¹ Yet in Britain these changes came suddenly to many clergy and faithful, since few had any significant awareness of the<br>

  Abstract: Jameson supports his thesis by looking closely at the nature of interpretation. Our understanding, he says, is colored by the concepts and categories that we inherit from our culture's interpretive tradition and that we use to comprehend what we read. How then can the literature of other ages be understood by readers from a present that is culturally so different from the past? Marxism lies at the foundation of Jameson's answer, because it conceives of history as a single collective narrative that links past and present; Marxist literary criticism reveals the unity of that uninterrupted narrative.<br>

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: Reading the lives of the saints not primarily as historical documents but as iconic expressions of original artworks fashioned by the eucharistic Christ, Astell puts the "faceless" Host in a dynamic relationship with these icons. With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

This field, in effect, is prepopulated by figures that shape expectations of what the politics of mourning looks like, the kinds of actions it involves, and the affective registers through which it is filtered.

  Book Title: Making All the Difference-Inclusion, Exclusion, and American Law<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Minow is passionately interested in the people-"different" people-whose lives are regularly (mis)shaped and (mis)directed by the legal system's ways of handling them. Drawing on literary and feminist theories and the insights of anthropology and social history, she identifies the unstated assumptions that tend to regenerate discrimination through the very reforms that are supposed to eliminate it. Education for handicapped children, conflicts between job and family responsibilities, bilingual education, Native American land claims-these are among the concrete problems she discusses from a fresh angle of vision.<br>

  7  A Politics of Enmity: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt1xx5gp">Inconceivable Effects</a><br>
  Abstract: Germania Death in Berlin (1956/1971), together with The Battle (1951/1974), Life of Gundling Lessing’s Sleep Dream Cry (1977), and Germania 3 Ghosts at the Dead Man (1995), testifies to Heiner Müller’s intense occupation with German history, particularly the history of violence. The play, which consists of thirteen miscellaneously interrelated scenes, generates a certain politics of enmity—a politics whose poetic itinerary has neither an evident beginning nor an end. We thus may well begin in the middle of the play, in a scene titled “Hommage à Stalin 1,” and we shall, for the time being, “imagine” (vorstellen) “Snow. Battle noise.<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Metaphor, and Aby Warburg's Atlas of Images-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Christopher D.<br>
  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the
      Mnemosyne-Atlascomplicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Abstract: The eclecticism encountered in the previous chapter—the history of cosmology, Hopi ritual, Ovidian metamorphosis, and so on—would seem to discourage any attempt to tie Warburg to a single period or method. Nevertheless, there are good reasons for doing so. Warburg roots his 
                     Kulturwissenschaft in the Renaissance. And it is in the Renaissance, but especially late quattrocento Florence, that he discerns most clearly the ability to create metaphoric distance, an ability he would exercise in every intellectual arena he enters.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt2jbph1">Memory, Metaphor, and Aby Warburg's Atlas of Images</a><br>
  Abstract: As he tried to widen the scope and refine the method of his 
                  Kulturwissenschaft, Warburg wrestled with giants whose historiographies had shaped the fields he hoped to map. To begin with, there was J.J. Winckelmann (1717–56), whose neo-Stoic, decidedly aesthetic interpretations of Greek culture and its imitators found “edle Einfalt und stille Größe” not only in the Laocoön statue and Plato’s philosophy, but also in Raphael’s painting.¹ Partly to shake free of Winckelmann’s constricting influence on German art history, Warburg turned to Jacob Burckhardt, whose enormously influential account of Italian Renaissance culture had been increasingly eclipsed increasingly eclipsed in<br>

  Abstract: The Cambodian refugee crisis along the Thai-Cambodian border, which unfolded in 1979, arguably posed the greatest challenge to the international humanitarian system of the Cold War period. Victims and oppressors, at the outset indistinguishable in their needs, became bound together in a symbiotic relationship by the relief operation and the politics that determined its path. Seemingly powerless to change the political context in which their work was embedded, aid agencies had to confront the probability that their aid was reviving one of the most brutal regimes in modern history, the Khmer Rouge.¹<br>

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1990s hundreds of thousands of Tamil villagers in southern India have participated in literacy lessons, science demonstrations, and other events designed to transform them into active citizens with access to state power. These efforts to spread enlightenment among the oppressed are part of a movement known as the Arivoli Iyakkam (the Enlightenment Movement), considered to be among the most successful mass literacy movements in recent history. In
         The Light of Knowledge, Francis Cody's ethnography of the Arivoli Iyakkam highlights the paradoxes inherent in such movements that seek to emancipate people through literacy when literacy is a power-laden social practice in its own right.<br>

  Book Title: The Emergency of Being-On Heidegger’s “Contributions to Philosophy”<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): POLT RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: Polt's original reading neither reduces this challenging text to familiar concepts nor refutes it, but engages it in a confrontation-an encounter that respects a way of thinking by struggling with it. He describes this most private work of Heidegger's philosophy as "a dissonant symphony that imperfectly weaves together its moments into a vast fugue, under the leitmotif of appropriation. This fugue is seeded with possibilities that are waiting for us, its listeners, to develop them. Some are dead ends-viruses that can lead only to a monolithic, monotonous misunderstanding of history. Others are embryonic insights that promise to deepen our thought, and perhaps our lives, if we find the right way to make them our own."<br>

  Abstract: Perestroika and the end of the Soviet Union transformed every aspect of life in Russia, and as hope began to give way to pessimism, popular culture came to reflect the anxiety and despair felt by more and more Russians. Free from censorship for the first time in Russia's history, the popular culture industry (publishing, film, and television) began to disseminate works that featured increasingly explicit images and descriptions of sex and violence.<br>

  Abstract: Anyone who set out to write a history of the concept of truth, in a strictly terminological sense aimed at definitional stringency, would have little to show for his efforts. The most popular definition, purportedly lifted by Scholasticism from Isaac ben Salomon Israeli’s book of definitions—
                  veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus [truth is the match of thing and intellect]¹—provides leeway for modification only in the shortest of its elements, in the neutrality of the ‘et’. While the definition should be understood, in keeping with its Aristotelian origins, as leaning toward the adaequatio intellectus ad rem [match of the<br>

  Abstract: If we attempt now to elaborate and set out a 
                  typology of metaphor histories with the help of paradigms, this does not imply that the thematic goal and ideal of the metaphorology we have in mind would consist in such a typology. In carrying out this task, we should recall that metaphorology—as a subbranch of conceptual history, and like the latter itself considered as a whole—must always be an auxiliary discipline to philosophy as it seeks to understand itself from its history and to bring that history to living presence. Our typology of metaphor histories must accordingly endeavor<br>

  Abstract: The impression might arise that our lengthy exemplification of the ‘transition’ from metaphors to concepts (and thus our entire attempt at a typology of metaphor histories) remains beholden to a primitive evolutionary schema. We shall seek to dispel this impression by surveying a type of metaphor history that proceeds in the opposite direction, 
                  from concepts to metaphors. With respect to the evidence presented, we must fear having to hear the same reproach once leveled by Lessing against Privy Counselor Klotz: “And how many of them do you suppose that he cites? In all, summa summarum, rightly counted—one.”¹ But we<br>

  Abstract: The topics covered in

The book concludes that it is a mistake to think of art as something subjective, or as an arbitrary social representation, and of Technology as an instrumental form of purposive rationality. "By segregating art and technology," Allen writes, "we divide ourselves against ourselves, casting up self-made obstacles to the ingenuity of art and technology."<br>

  INTRODUCTION: from:

  Abstract: There are many books about art, many about technology, but few about art 
                     and technology—about their affinity and the relationship of both together to human experience.¹ It is this relationship that is my topic here. I develop philosophical concepts of art, artifact, knowledge, technology, and tool, which I use to explore parallel questions about artistry in technology and technics in art. The result is a work of interdisciplinary philosophical research, with concepts and arguments drawn from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, science studies, aesthetics, and the history, philosophy, and anthropology of art and technology.<br>

  Book Title: The Total Work of Art in European Modernism-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Roberts David<br>
  Abstract: The history and theory of the total work of art pose a whole series of questions not only to aesthetic modernism and its utopias but also to the whole epoch from the French Revolution to the totalitarian revolutions of the twentieth century. The total work of art indicates the need to revisit key assumptions of modernism, such as the foregrounding of the autonomy and separation of the arts at the expense of the countertendencies to the reunion of the arts, and cuts across the neat equation of avant-gardism with progress and deconstructs the familiar left-right divide between revolution and reaction, the modern and the antimodern. Situated at the interface between art, religion, and politics, the total work of art invites us to rethink the relationship between art and religion and art and politics in European modernism.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v9cg">The Total Work of Art in European Modernism</a><br>
  Abstract: This is the first book in English to treat the total work of art as a key concept in aesthetic modernism, and, as far as I can see, the first to attempt an overview of the theory and history of the total work in European art since the French Revolution. It is therefore both an ambitious and necessarily preliminary undertaking, in which my guiding concern has been to demonstrate the significance of the idea of the total work for modern art and politics. The term “total work of art” translates the German

  Abstract: Rousseau stands at the beginning of what we might call the passage of modernity. In
                  Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique(The Social Contract or Principles of Political Right) (1762) he constructs the imaginary history of the foundation of society through an act of association that effects “the passage from the state of nature to the civil state” (1.8). This founding act, through which the “Republicorbody politic” gains its unity, common identity, life, and will, points to a second act of self-institution: the recovery of the republic, of the sovereign body politic, through the refoundation of<br>

  7  Gesamtkunstwerk and Avant-Garde from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7v9cg">The Total Work of Art in European Modernism</a><br>
  Abstract: Resisting translation, both
                  avant-gardeandGesamtkunstwerkhave retained their original linguistic inflexion: the one the expression of Gallic dash and daring, the other the expression of Teutonic profundities. These subliminal associations reflect two very different senses of aesthetic modernism, or rather, contribute to the valorization of a French-oriented as opposed to a German-oriented history of modern art, in which French painting rather than German music plays the leading role. Thisparti prisis so self-evident that the last crucial stage of European modernism, from the 1880s to the 1920s, is comprehended in terms of avant-gardism, that is to say, in<br>

  Abstract: The sources of the theatre reform movement in the first decades of the twentieth century drew their inspiration from Wagner, in particular
                  Parsifal,and from the theatre of the symbolists: “In the history of the modern theatre it is possible to trace a tradition from Wagner’s concept ofGesamtkunstwerkto the second generation symbolists (Appia, Craig, Meyerhold) and from them to the entire movement of the ‘retheatricalization’ of theatre, with the director as the master artist uniting the arts.”¹ The symbolist theatre of shadows and halftones is perhaps best exemplified by Debussy’s operaPelléas et Mélisande(1902), based on Maeterlinck’s<br>

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Abstract: We saw in the previous chapter that according to historicism, the nature, essence, or identity of a thing lies in its history. The unprecedented intellectual revolution effected by historicism in the early decades of the nineteenth century endowed all of human existence with a temporal dimension, with irreversible ramifications for how we conceive of ourselves and of our world even today. Historicism rolled out all things in time, as one might roll out in space with a rolling pin a crust for the bottom of a pie. All things human were now perceived to be subject to a development in<br>

  Chapter 8  Presence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z6r9">Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation</a><br>
  Abstract: For two reasons the notion of “presence” now needs to be discussed.¹ First, the etymological meaning of the word “representation” already compels us to do so: representation is a making present of, or the granting of presence (again), to something that is absent. This is what our representative assemblies do: they make the people present because the people themselves cannot be present in such assemblies. A portrait may make present to the spectator somebody who has been dead for centuries. Similarly, the writing of history gives presence again to an absent past, and its very raison d’être is to do<br>

  Chapter 9  Experience (I) from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z6r9">Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation</a><br>
  Abstract: As far as I know, the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) has until now been the only theorist of historical writing to take seriously the notion of historical experience.¹ This is not surprising, since there seems to be near-unanimous agreement that the experience of the past is of no use for a proper explanation of historical writing and of how it came into being. Or, to be more precise, all that the existing philosophy of history has on offer is a theory 
                  denying that there could be such a thing as an experience of the past at all. A<br>

  Chapter 11  Subjectivity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z6r9">Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation</a><br>
  Abstract: The Magritte conception of history discussed in the previous chapter taught us what historians (implicitly) have in mind when speaking of the “objectivity” or “subjectivity” of the historical text: the historical text is objective if there are no differences between what one sees when looking at the 
                  text and what one sees when looking at the past itself . We also found that there is a peculiar sophistication in the Magritte conception of history (which I tried to rescue with the notion of historical experience), making it definitely more interesting than such naively believed views ordinarily are.

  Chapter 12  Politics from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z6r9">Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

  Abstract: “Happiness is a new idea in Europe,” boasted Robespierre’s colleague Saint-Just in 1794.¹ He believed that the new era in human history ushered in by the American and French revolutions in the eighteenth century was characterized by an unprecedented attention to secular happiness as a political project. For Saint-Just the promise of the Enlightenment and the goal of revolutionary aspiration was comprehended in the word “happiness.” Contemporary scholars have by and large concurred with Saint-Just’s assessment. The eighteenth century, they claim, conferred respectability on the pursuit of secular happiness as no other period before it. Indeed, eighteenth-century thinkers, not satisfied<br>

  Abstract: At the beginning of chapter 5, I suggested that the Solonian hermeneutic of happiness cast a long shadow across history, a claim amply corroborated by Darrin McMahon’s sweeping history of the idea of happiness.¹ Having now given a formal specification of the narrative form necessary to suspend the Solonian hermeneutic of happiness—the 
                  trial narrative—I will show in subsequent chapters how the trial narrative rises to prominence in the eighteenth century and becomes a dominant narrative form underlying a powerful and interlocking set of discourses that come to constitute our modernity.

  Chapter 9  Kantian Ethics and the Discourses of Modernity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z7tm">Mourning Happiness</a><br>
  Abstract: The trial narrative paradigm achieves its most radical development and rigorous theorization in Kant’s writings on ethics, politics, history, and religion.¹ When Kant’s thought is interrogated from the perspective of the trial narrative, not only do we gain unconventional insight into the underlying narrative structure of his theories, but we also discover surprising continuities between the eighteenth-century novel, sentimentalism, and Kantian ethics.² Indeed, I would argue that novels such as 
                  Pamela and Julie are the imaginative precondition for the emergence of Kantian ethics, just as Kant theorizes one of the most important narrative developments in the eighteenth century.³ Among his<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctt7z7tm">Mourning Happiness</a><br>
  Abstract: The analysis of Kant has enabled us to understand the furthest expansion of the trial narrative paradigm—the replication of its logic in the discourses of ethics, politics, and history—and the most radical effects of the trial form. These effects are still visible in our lives today: the conception of happiness as an affect, the ambivalent attitude toward happiness, the structuring of our lives according to the alternation of desire/satisfaction or work/leisure, the ongoing legacy of utilitarianism’s reductive, mathematized conception of happiness. But the effects of the trial narrative are not always easy to discern: despite widespread criticism of<br>

  Abstract: Orality, Writing, and Disjuncture Alienation, a favorite diagnosis variously applied to modem man’s plight since at least Hegel and Feuerbach, has not been commonly thought of in terms of the technological history of the word, although some attention, more analytic than historical or clinical, has been given by structuralists to certain tensions attendant on writing.¹ Yet it would appear that the technological inventions of writings, print, and electronic verbalization, in their historical effects, are connected with and have helped bring about a certain kind of alienation within the human lifeworld.

  Abstract: Although there is a large and growing literature on the differences between oral and written verbalization, many aspects of the differences have not been looked into at all, and many others, although well known, have not been examined in their full implications. Among these latter is the relationship of the socalled “audience” to writing as such, to the situation that inscribed communication establishes and to the roles that readers as readers are consequently called on to play. Some studies in literary history and criticism at times touch near this subject, but none, it appears, take it up in any historical<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.cttq42vq">Interfaces of the Word</a><br>
  Abstract: Studies in this book have treated the history of the word often, though not entirely, in tenus of sequestration, interposition, diaeresis or division, alienation, and closed fields or systems. The history of the word since its encounter and interaction with technology when the first writing systems were devised some six thousand years ago has been largely a matter of such separations and systems. By comparison with oral speech, writing is itself a closed system: a written text exists on its own, physically separate from any speaker or hearer, as no real spoken word can exist.

Focusing mainly on Augustinian, Premonstratensian, Clarissan, Penitent, and Cistercian monastic houses, she investigates an extensive panoply of multimodal references (visual: as in cartographical plans and various pictorial representations; verbal: as in travel literature, topographies, anecdotes, and legends) and fully fledged “foundation stories” (formal histories told to relate<br>

  Abstract: Nestled among the concrete, glass, and steel skyscrapers in the central business district of Perth, Western Australia, the mock Tudor frontage of “Ye London Court” is, at first sight, a curious landmark. Completed in 1937, the cobbled pedestrian mall compresses history, time, and place. A plaque at the entrance commemorates 1997 as both the 60th anniversary of the space and the 600th anniversary of the election of Dick Whittington as Lord Mayor of London. “Ye London Court” is just one of the many examples littered throughout the Australian landscape of medievalism being employed to foster connections between the antipodes and<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Author(s) Zammito John<br>
  Abstract: There is some truth in Goethe’s pronouncement that Johann Gottfried Herder’s ideas had been both absorbed and forgotten by the conventional wisdom of German culture after 1800.¹ He was absorbed either into the project of the Jena
                  Romantikerand their literary hermeneutics or into the project of Hegel and his philosophy of history. But after the rise of historicism in the school of Ranke and Droysen, a retrospective redemption seemed possible. Thus, in the classic formulations of Meinecke and Stadelmann, Herder was resurrected as the “father of historicism.”² He was credited with pioneering the stress on individuality, development, and the<br>

  Author(s) Adler Hans<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder has long been known for having developed groundbreaking concepts of thought as well as having modified those of others decisively.
                  Humanitätis—along with concepts such as origin, history, culture, Volk, and language—one of the core concepts of Herder’s works. As a matter of fact,Humanitätis Herder’s all-encompassing concept. All his thinking, writing, and actions were centered around it. In short: Herder was the philosopher ofHumanität.Not only has Herder often been called “the philosopher of humanity”; he has also been accused of being the proponent of a vague “philanthropy.”¹ The fact that scholars<br>

  Author(s) Bohm Arnd<br>
  Abstract: Herder’s views on political topics such as liberty and tyranny, sovereignty, the constitutions of states, statecraft, and international relations were largely theoretical, the product of wide-ranging studies in history, theology, philosophy, and the emerging discipline of comparative anthropology. Due to his vocation as a theologian and Protestant clergyman, Herder was virtually precluded from holding political office or commenting frankly on public affairs, except as mediated by the established church. Thus he stands in contrast to Goethe, whose training as a lawyer and long years of service managing the affairs of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach gave him practical insight into the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt14brrn7">A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder</a><br>
  Author(s) Menze Ernest A.<br>
  Abstract: The study of the reception of and influences on literature is relatively new and, for the works of many authors, has hardly begun. Current literature tends to receive the most attention. In the past, literary works were often co-opted for ideological reasons and in the process misinterpreted and distorted; this was the case with Johann Gottfried Herder through the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century. Ultimately, Herder was discredited by nationalist perversion of his works during the National-Socialist era. Whereas there are several studies dealing with Herder’s early-twentieth-century reception history, little has been done regarding Herder’s influence in earlier<br>

  Book Title: Textual Cultures: Cultural Texts-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Treharne Elaine<br>
  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Abstract: Nancy Regalado has devoted her career to one of the most important chapters in the history of writing in the West, the centuries between 1100 and 1500, which witnessed the rise of vernacular culture. As the use of writing expanded from ecclesiastical precincts ruled by Latin into courts and towns, with their common tongues, the very conception of writing – who could write, what could be written, how texts should look, how they should be transmitted, who could have access to them – underwent radical transformations.

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

  Book Title: Interconnections-Gender and Race in American History<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Parker Alison M.<br>
  Abstract: This collection builds on decades of interdisciplinary scholarship by African American women and gender historians and feminist scholars, bridging the gap between well-developed theories of race, gender, and power and the practice of historical research. It reveals the interdependent construction of racial and gender identity in individuals' lived experiences in specific historical contexts, such as westward expansion, civil rights movements, or economic depression as well as national and transnational debates over marriage, citizenship and sexual mores. All of these essays consider multiple aspects of identity, including sexuality, class, religion, and nationality, among others, but the volume emphasizes gender and race--the focus of our new book series--as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history.

In this chapter, I continue to examine the claims of Latin Americanists, in this instance, focusing upon the aesthetic effect of magical realism, rather than the reasons for its appearance.<br>

  Book Title: Medievalist Enlightenment-From Charles Perrault to Jean-Jacques Rousseau<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: Literary medievalism played a vital role in the construction of the French Enlightenment. Starting with the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns, it influenced movements leading to the Romantic rediscovery of the Middle Ages, and helped to shape new literary genres, from the epistolary novel to the fairy tale and opera. Indeed, the dominant mode of the early Enlightenment, 'galanterie', was of medievalist inspiration. Moreover, the academic study of medieval texts underlay modern ideals of scholarship, institutionalized at the royal academies. The Middle Ages polemically functioned as an alternative site, allowing authors to rethink their age's political and social ideologies. At the centre of these debates was the notion of historical progress. Was progress possible, as the 'philosophes' held, or was human history a process of degeneration, with the Middle Ages as a lost Golden Age? From the re-evaluation of the medieval thus emerged not only the seeds of a new poetics, but also the central questions that preoccupied Enlightenment thinkers from Montesquieu to Rousseau. This book shows how, in order to understand the aesthetic and intellectual transformations that marked modernity, it is essential to examine how this period conceived of the past, and particularly those "Dark Ages" that served as the defining foil for the modern Age of Light. Alicia C. Montoya is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Literary and Cultural Studies at the Radboud University Nijmegen.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter argues that for early French Enlightenment authors, the medieval functioned not primarily as a historical concept, as it does for us today, but rather as a floating rhetorical category to which a precise content had yet to be ascribed. Modern ideas of the medieval as a discrete, closed-off period in history are themselves the product of discussions that took place, during the Enlightenment and at other historical moments, on the meaning and movement of history. Because the early Enlightenment’s concept of 
                  moyen âge was different from the way we conceive of it today, this chapter will first backtrack<br>

A millennium of the ancient world boils down to antiquity. The centuries from 800 to 1500 can be amalgamated into medievalism. Early modern periods are spoken of as homogeneous ages. Not only are ages and centuries homogenized, movements such as the Reformation or the Renaissance acquire a monolithic aspect. The equalizing resolution of phenomena distances them from one another by eliminating nuances and ambiguities. An example of such leveling is our perception of the 1587<br>

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Book Title: Christians and Jews in Angevin England-The York Massacre of 1190, Narratives and Contexts<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: The mass suicide and murder of the men, women and children of the Jewish community in York on 16 March 1190 is one of the most scarring events in the history of Anglo-Judaism, and an aspect of England's medieval past which is widely remembered around the world. However, the York massacre was in fact only one of a series of attacks on communities of Jews across England in 1189-90; they were violent expressions of wider new constructs of the nature of Christian and Jewish communities, and the targeted outcries of local townspeople, whose emerging urban politics were enmeshed within the swiftly developing structures of royal government. This new collection considers the massacre as central to the narrative of English and Jewish history around 1200. Its chapters broaden the contexts within which the narrative is usually considered and explore how a narrative of events in 1190 was built up, both at the time and in following years. They also focus on two main strands: the role of narrative in shaping events and their subsequent perception; and the degree of 'convivencia' between Jews and Christians and consideration of the circumstances and processes through which neighbours became enemies and victims.

  Author(s) Watson Sethina<br>
  Abstract: During the course of one desperate night in March 1190, an estimated 150 Jewish men, women and children committed suicide or were murdered at the royal castle in York, where they had fled for safety. The York massacre horrified contemporaries, Christians and Jews, and is remembered today around the world. It is recalled in Jewish elegies and holds a singular, sad place in the English national story as ʹthe most notorious anti-Jewish atrocityʹ in its history.¹ Most particularly, the memory is tied to place. Cliffordʹs Tower, the mid-thirteenth-century stone keep of the royal castle, has become its most enduring symbol.²<br>

  Abstract: Barrie Dobsonʹs wide-ranging and richly-detailed study of the massacre of the Jews of York in March 1190 remains the definitive history of that terrible event.¹ Most importantly he demonstrated that the massacre did not mark the end of a Jewish community in the city but rather occurred near its beginning: very soon after their first settlement under Josce and Benedict of York in the 1170s and 1180s. The return of Jews to York after 1190, and the new Jewish community which flourished in the early thirteenth century, was the subject of later papers by Dobson, now reprinted in a single<br>

  Abstract: The story that follows is to be read as an exercise in intellectual history, and in particular as an attempt to trace the debt owed not just by twelfth-century English chroniclers, but by English churchmen and kings, to the literary and historical traditions of a much more distant past. In pursuing this line of enquiry, I owe a special debt to two modern historians. The first, Barrie Dobson, in his study of the York massacre of 1190, has identified the chief contemporary witness to these events, the

  Abstract: The Jewish Exchequer is not a new subject. William Prynne in the seventeenth century, and Thomas Madox a century later, were the first scholars to devote sustained attention to the institution.¹ In their wake, a series of twentieth-century historians have followed, each making valuable contributions.² But despite the attention that has been devoted to the workings of the institution, the historical context within which we should understand the Jewish Exchequerʹs emergence, and the significance of its emergence for the subsequent history of the medieval English Jewish community, are subjects that will still repay more careful investigation.

  Author(s) Zadoff Ethan<br>
  Abstract: The study of medieval law occupies a unique niche within traditional academic discourse. A concentration on philological precision, challenges pertaining to manuscript study, and the ʹinternal languageʹ of jurisprudence have at times over-shadowed the consideration of the wider societal implications of medieval law and curtailed its use in the investigation of broad themes of social and cultural history. This is particularly true of the thirteenth-century Anglo-Jewish legal corpus, the study of which has been relegated to a select few articles and studies.¹<br>

  Book Title: The Civil Wars after 1660-Public Remembering in Late Stuart England<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Neufeld Matthew<br>
  Abstract: This book examines the conflicting ways in which the civil wars and Interregnum were remembered, constructed and represented in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England. It argues that during the late Stuart period, public remembering of the English civil wars and Interregnum was not concerned with re-fighting the old struggle but rather with commending and justifying, or contesting and attacking, the Restoration settlements. After the return of King Charles II the political nation had to address the question of remembering and forgetting the recent conflict. The answer was to construct a polity grounded on remembering and scapegoating puritan politics and piety. The proscription of the puritan impulse enacted by the Restoration settlements was supported by a public memory of the 1640s and 1650s which was used to show that Dissenters could not, and should not, be trusted with power. Drawing upon the interdisciplinary field of social memory studies, this book offers a new perspective on the historical and political cultures of early modern England, and will be of significant interest to social, cultural and political historians as well as scholars working in memory studies.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt2tt1n8">The Civil Wars after 1660</a><br>
  Abstract: In the years immediately following the restoration of the monarchy, the English had a paradoxical relationship to their nation’s recent history. On the one hand, they were supposed to forget about it. The Convention Parliament had passed an Act of Oblivion within a few months of the king’s return. This legislation commanded people not to remember publicly the civil wars. On the other hand, personal memories of what were referred to as the ‘late broken times’ were lodged firmly within most people’s minds. This was recognised openly, as in the preface to a short book called

  Abstract: In our post-modern or

Within an apparently dynamic frame of moving horizons which, on the surface, recognises that meaning does not settle easily within segregated presentism, we have locked theearlymodern into a temporal pocket on the lower end of a value-added sequential scale. Our contemporary understanding of linear history, as an accumulation of personal and communal experience, is, of course, more complex and, indeed, less ‘linear’ than the Aristotelian concept of the numerical estimation of movement.

  Abstract: Neoplatonic love had been presented by Castiglione as the perfect antidote to the darker emotions associated with human passion – jealousy being prominent among the transgressive desires that required suppression.¹ It is not wholly surprising, therefore, that the dismantling of the Neoplatonic aesthetic in Góngora would liberate a revisionary play upon that most illicit, appetitive drive whose cultural history allowed for the interconnection of erotic and emulative poetics. This chapter will explore how motifs of envy and jealousy are interwoven in Góngora’s love poetry and forge a metaphoric merger between two complementary attitudes: the will to usurp the forbidden feminine object<br>

He now finds himself lumped together with others under the label of ‘modern classics,’ a label from which he would have recoiled.”²<br>

Two literary and visual artefacts from the wars of nineteenth-century America pose this question, and offer insights into a chapter of media history that is still poorly understood. In the first, Richard Caton Woodville’s

This most iconic of genre paintings records a foundational scene of US imperialism, and captures the public drama of national expansion.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Abstract: Born in Stuttgart in 1770, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel studied theology and philosophy at the Tübinger Stift, the theological seminary attached to the University of Tübingen. Here, he formed friendships with two students who would also become major figures in German cultural history, the poet Friedrich Hölderlin and the philosopher F. W. J. Schelling. He graduated in 1793. Not wanting to become a vicar, he started working as a private tutor, first in Bern (where he became acquainted with the work of the economists James Steuart and Adam Smith, whose ideas would remain crucial to his thinking) and after that<br>

  Abstract: The year 1788 stands out in the history of German philosophy for being the year in which Kant’s
                  Kritik der praktischen Vernunftwas published, in Riga, and Arthur Schopenhauer was born, down the Baltic coast in Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), on 22 February. This contingent conjunction of the two philosophers’ lives was a happy coincidence, since Schopenhauer would in due course become one of Kant’s most devoted followers (as well as one of his most stringent critics). Their lives were markedly different, though, and can perhaps be taken as symptomatic of the larger differences between the Enlightenment and the Romantic<br>

  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rolle Sabine<br>
  Abstract: Established, commissioned, and edited by the Department of German at the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh German Yearbook encourages and disseminates lively and open discussion of themes pertinent to German Studies, viewed from all angles but with particular interest in problems arising out of politics and history. No other yearbook covers the entire field while addressing a focused theme in each issue. Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, volume 3 re-directs current debates on memory and tradition, opening up fresh perspectives on the cultural history of the GDR and exploring how the nation's cultural discourses entered into a productive but often problematic dialogue with the values of the past and with the German cultural inheritance. Topics include the compositional engagement with musical heritage; industrial design and cultural politics; the establishment of antifascist monuments and their use as sites of resistance; constructions of a cultural heritage in architecture; the influence of cultural politics on literary scholarship; continuities and breaks with tradition in visual and literary culture; and engagement with the past in the works of Konrad Wolf, Irmtraud Morgner, and Anna Seghers.

  Book Title: Tragedy and the Tragic in German Literature, Art, and Thought-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Quinn Thomas P.<br>
  Abstract: The many catastrophes of German history have often been described as tragic. Consequently, German literature, music, philosophy, painting, and even architecture are rich in tragic connotations. Yet exactly what "tragedy" and "the tragic" may mean requires clarification. The poet creates a certain artful shape and trajectory for raw experience by "putting it into words"; but does putting such experience into words (or paintings or music or any other form) betray suffering by turning it into mere art? Or is it art that first turns mere suffering into tragic experience by revealing and clarifying its deepest dimension? What are we talking about, exactly, when we talk about tragic experience and tragic art, especially in an age in which, according to Hannah Arendt, evil has become banal? Does banality muffle or even annul the tragic? Does tragedy take suffering and transform it into beauty, as Schiller thought? Is it in the interest of truth for suffering to be "beautiful"? Is it possible that poetry, music, and art are important because they in fact create the meaning of suffering? Or is suffering only suffering and not accessible to meaning, tragic or otherwise? This book comprises essays that seek to clarify the meaning of tragedy and the tragic in its many German contexts, art forms, and disciplines, from literature and philosophy to music, painting, and history.

  Abstract: The tragedy of modernity is that, turning its back on tragedy, it moves along with reckless abandon and in the process forgets the wisdom of the ages. Even its attempts to proceed with caution, entrusting history to the guidance of reason, all too often misfire, for what does reason have to say about where we should be headed? Are we to do what makes rational sense for each of us as isolated individuals? Should we act for this historical moment in which collectively we find ourselves? Or is the proper goal the ultimate good of humanity, as might be realized<br>

They include, among others, the transition from what the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico called the age of heroes, where one single individual could still direct the course of history, to the age of men, when the due procedure of civic institutions, and no longer the great individual, became the guarantor of order, justice, and historical change.<br>

  Abstract: Like most modern nation states, Canada was invented slowly, and like many nation states beyond Europe, it was invented by white colonizers who came from overseas. Indeed, the standard history of the name “Canada” itself retraces the nation’s slow historical emergence as a product of European expansion and colonization. Originally a Huron-Iroquois word meaning “village” or “settlement,” 
                  kanata entered the Euro-American record through Jacques Cartier’s accounts of his explorations in the 1530s and 1540s, and referred to a region in the Laurentians (see ch. 4, Laflèche).

Their subject was rather North America and the Native Americans — in other words, the anthropology, human geography, or, as it was called at the time, the natural history of the New World.

The clergy, in particular, who made a decisive contribution to the history of drama by encouraging the performance of plays in the collèges for the purpose of classical education, rhetorical training, and the moral edification of pupils, rejected the performance of “profane” texts. Beginning with the 1930s, however, the influence of European theater led to a modernization in the repertoire and the performance practice of clerical theater. Many clergymen also composed<br>

  Author(s) Grace Sherrill<br>
  Abstract: In 1967, Canada celebrated its centenary, the hundredth anniversary of Confederation, but there are many other defining years and events which have come to be seen as foundational or transformative for the country’s history. The First World War marked Canada’s entry onto the world stage as a nation separate from Great Britain (while still part of the British Commonwealth); the Second World War consolidated Canada’s national stature and independence and paved the way for a number of significant cultural and social developments during the cold war years that would have their major impact after 1967.

  26:  Contemporary English-Canadian Drama and Theater from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81gcs">History of Literature in Canada</a><br>
  Author(s) Nothof Anne<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary English-Canadian playwrights articulate a diversity of voices and give expression to the country’s many particular social and psychological spaces. They map its physical and mental terrain by dramatizing specific communities in terms of their histories, internal conflicts, and psychic landscapes. Since the 1960s regional history has continued to stimulate playwriting, providing local stories that inform the life of the community and the nation. These plays often revisit an apparently benign Canadian history from a critical perspective, and expose moral and political travesties. More recently, English-Canadian playwrights have been engaged in mapping specific communities in terms of ethnicity and ideology.<br>

  Abstract: I have attempted to show that the the mid-twentieth century constituted a watershed in Spanish American poetry. This is confirmed by two more important facts of literary history. The first is that Borges was now about to begin writing a significant amount of poetry again, after having all but abandoned the genre since 1929. The second is that in 1954, the year which saw the first volume of Neruda’s

  Book Title: Goethe Yearbook 19-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): MacLeod Catriona<br>
  Abstract: The ‘Goethe Yearbook’ is a publication of the Goethe Society of North America, encouraging North American Goethe scholarship by publishing original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the ‘Goethezeit’ while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. Volume 19 of the ‘Goethe Yearbook’ continues to investigate the connection between Goethe's scientific theories and his aesthetics, with essays on his optics and his plant morphology. A special section examines the central role that Goethe philology has had in establishing practices that shaped the history of ‘Germanistik’ as a whole. The yearbook also includes essays on legal history and the novella, Goethe ‘Lieder’, esoteric mysticism in ‘Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre’, and Werther's sexual pathology. The volume also includes three essays re-examining Goethe's aesthetics in the context of the history of deconstruction, as well as the customary book review section.

  Author(s) TANG CHENXI<br>
  Abstract: Even prior to its publication in Friedrich Schiller’s literary journal 
                  Die Horen in 1795, Goethe’s novella cycle Unterhaltungen deutscher Ausgewanderten had already been assigned an eminent place in literary history: in a letter dated November 7, 1794, Schiller informed his friend Christian Körner that Goethe “ist jetzt beschäftigt, eine zusammenhängende Suite von Erzählungen im Geschmack des Decameron des Boccaz auszuarbeiten.”¹ Indeed, the structural borrowing from the Decameron is so undisguised in Unterhaltungen that it is undoubtedly meant to revive, under entirely new historical conditions, the genre of the novella as established by Boccaccio (1313–75).

  Book Title: Ethics and Exemplary Narrative in Chaucer and Gower-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): MITCHELL J. ALLAN<br>
  Abstract: Why do medieval writers routinely make use of exemplary rhetoric? How does it work, and what are its ethical and poetical values? And if Chaucer and Gower must be seen as vigorously subverting it, then why do they persist in using it? Borrowing from recent developments in ethical criticism and theory, this book addresses such questions by reconstructing a late medieval rationale for the ethics of exemplary narrative. The author argues that Chaucer's ‘Canterbury Tales’ and Gower's ‘Confessio Amantis’ attest to the vitality of a narrative - rather than strictly normative - ethics that has roots in premodern traditions of practical reason and rhetoric. Chaucer and Gower are shown to be inheritors and respecters of an early and unexpected form of ethical pragmatism - which has profound implications for the orthodox history of ethics in the West.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81rhw">Ethics and Exemplary Narrative in Chaucer and Gower</a><br>
  Abstract: My characterization of the ethical potentialities of exemplary rhetoric admittedly flies in the face of a commonplace critical presumption about the teleology of morals and the authoritarian nature of didactic literature. A composite sketch of the teleological account might take the following form: morality took an unfortunate turn in the Middle Ages when it assimilated itself to Church-dominated dogmatism, until moral rationalism found its feet again in the autonomous ethics of Enlightenment reason and Reformist spirituality. The assumption is that modern philosophy forever made ethics personal and appealingly complex again; and so in the vicissitudes of history, medieval morality stands<br>

  Abstract: Recent years have seen the publication in Germany of a vast number and array of multigenerational family narratives that look back to the turbulent history of the twentieth century. They look in particular to the family stories that are passed on from one generation to the next as a way of understanding and representing the past, and they also explore those that are kept secret or hidden from view and yet contribute to shaping the present.

  Abstract: Writing women’s lives has always been central to the feminist project. In the 1970s confessional and autobiographical writing by women contributed to and popularized a feminist politics of self-discovery, autonomy, and solidarity.¹ Questioning the relationship between language and the subject, the body and culture, female authors asserted the social and historical import of their experiences. Notably, women’s writing provided insight into women’s experiences of war and the Third Reich at a stage when feminist history of the period was still in its infancy.² And now, in the twenty-first century, women writers are continuing to revisit the National Socialist past and<br>

  Author(s) Marshall Sheridan<br>
  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

So says Arturo Pérez-Reverte when discussing Spain’s past, and the temptation to use that past for political ends.¹ His point is that history, the past, is only dangerous when it is manipulated in the present. We need not fear it except when we are ignorant about it, for then others can retell it, reshape it and, in so doing, mould it and us to their purposes. However, knowledge of events, a memory of them, whether direct or indirect,<br>

Identity, Goytisolo suggests, is intimately linked to one’s individual recall of the past set against the backdrop of the shared history of a community. Memory is the key to unlock this sense of identity by offering access to the past, from the perspective of the present, with a view to the future direction that the individual’s or community’s life may take.

  Book Title: Museums and Biographies-Stories, Objects, Identities<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Hill Kate<br>
  Abstract: Museums and biographies both tell the stories of lives. This innovative collection examines for the first time biography - of individuals, objects and institutions - in relationship to the museum, casting new light on the many facets of museum history and theory, from the lives of prominent curators, to the context of museums of biography and autobiography. Separate sections cover individual biography and museum history, problematising individual biographies, institutional biographies, object biographies, and museums as biographies/autobiographies. These articles offer new ways of thinking about museums and museum history, exploring how biography in and of the museum enriches museum stories by stressing the inter-related nature of lives of people, objects and institutions as part of a dense web of relationships. Through their widely ranging research, the contributors demonstrate the value of thinking about the stories told in and by museums, and the relationships which make up museums; and suggest new ways of undertaking and understanding museum biographies.

Following Lenoir’s dogged pursuit of his cause, the depot was eventually turned into a public museum that fused emerging ideas about art, history and personality, enhanced with the flair of Lenoir’s creative curation, to produce a unique representation of France.

Our argument will be a crosssectional one; it explains, without depending on imitation or history, why decentralization makes sense here and now for current executives of large manufacturing firms. Our argument also is a structuralist one: For both the innovators and later adopters, divisionalization must be interpreted with special reference to the context of what the other firms in a sector of the economy were doing.<br>

  Book Title: Promises of 1968-Crisis, Illusion and Utopia<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): TISMANEANU VLADIMIR<br>
  Abstract: This book is a state of the art reassessment of the significance and consequences of the events associated with the year 1968 in Europe and in North America. Since 1998, there hasn’t been any collective, comparative and interdisciplinary effort to discuss 1968 in the light of both contemporary headways of scholarship and new evidence on this historical period. A significant departure from earlier approaches lies in the fact that the manuscript is constructed in unitary fashion, as it goes beyond the East–West divide, trying to identify the common features of the sixties. The latter are analyzed as simultaneously global and local developments. The main problems addressed by the contributors of this volume are: the sixties as a generational clash; the redefinition of the political as a consequence of the ideological challenges posed to the status-quo by the sixty-eighters; the role of Utopia and the de-radicalization of intellectuals; the challenges to imperialism (Soviet/American); the cultural revolution of the sixties; the crisis of ‘really existing socialism’ and the failure of “socialism with a human face”; the gradual departure from the Yalta-system; the development of a culture of human rights and the project of a global civil society; the situation of 1968 within the general evolution of European history (esp. the relationship of 1968 with 1989). In contrast to existing books, the book provides a fundamental and unique synthesis of approaches on 1968: first, it contains critical (vs. nostalgic) re-evaluations of the events from the part of significant sixty-eighters; second, it includes historical analyses based on new archival research; third, it gathers important theoretical re-assessments of the intellectual history of the 1968; and fourth, it bridges 1968 with its aftermath and its pre-history, thus avoiding an over-contextualization of the topics in question.<br>

  Abstract: The events of 1968 radically influenced the social, political, and cultural landscape of the post-1945 world. In the context of the Cold War, 1968 was a transnational moment of revolt against the status quo beyond the east-West divide.¹ it represented a turning point in world history that brought about a sweeping axiological reassessment of politics.² More than ten years ago, the editors of a collective volume about 1968 stated that “the memories of witnesses to the events of this

The themes of authenticity, justice, and participatory democracy were pervasive.

  Abstract: It should be no coincidence that the great interest in heroes as well as the beginning of the study of heroic myth falls on the high age of nationalism. It was also the high age of revolutions, of the advent of mass politics, of science, and the passionate struggle between a numbers of -isms: conservatism, liberalism, socialism, republicanism, romanticism, anarchism, and so on. No wonder that the great debate in an era that saw the shaping of several social science disciplines was about the role of individuals in history, notably heroes, versus the blind operation of structural forces and social<br>

  Abstract: The voluminous body of scholarly work on Vasil Levski, among which some genuine and masterly contributions stand out, is focused entirely on the historical figure and its activities. The first and only analysis of Levski’s posthumous fate is Genchev’s chapter on “Vasil Levski in the Bulgarian historical memory,” which he published in his 1987 book on Levski. In it, Genchev makes an attempt to explain the abrupt turn in the Levski discourse after the Balkan Wars and the First World War. He contends that history itself vindicated Levski’s ideas. The reason for this, according to Genchev, is the critical reassessment<br>

  Abstract: This book has been an argument for the relevance of microhistory, an attempt to demonstrate the significance of local knowledge in approaching the big issues of the profession and of life in general. It is taken for granted that a narrative, written in a few big languages and using examples of a few big countries, has universal connotations. Other examples in other languages (even large languages as Mandarin, Arabic or Hindi) are, at most, allowed to be footnotes in this universal sweep. It is this book’s attempt to demonstrate the general meaning and worth of examples from very small places,<br>

The lively interaction and debates engendered by this occasion highlighted the necessity of creating a common regional framework of intercultural dialogue. A year later, meeting in the same place, the idea of a ‘Reader’ containing a representative collection of fundamental texts that had contributed to and/or reflected upon the formation of narratives of national identity in Central and Southeast Europe was conceived.

  Book Title: Measuring Time, Making History-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hunt Lynn<br>
  Abstract: Time is the crucial ingredient in history, and yet historians rarely talk about time as such.

  Book Title: Debating the Past-Modern Bulgarian Historiography—From Stambolov to Zhivkov<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Daskalov Roumen<br>
  Abstract: The book is comprised of the four major debates on modern Bulgarian history from Independence in 1878 to the fall of communism in 1989. The debates are on the Bulgarian–Russian/Soviet relations, on the relations between Agrarians and Communists, on Bulgarian Fascism, and on Communism. They are associated with the rule of key political personalities in Bulgarian history: Stambolov (1887–1894), Stamboliiski (1919–1923), Tsar Boris III (1918–1943), and the communist leaders Georgi Dimitrov and Todor Zhivkov (1956–1989). The debates are traced through their various articulations and dramatic turns from their beginnings to the present day.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1282qc">Debating the Past</a><br>
  Abstract: This book contains four historiographical studies, devoted to the most hotly debated issues of the history of Bulgaria from its liberation (1878) to the present that have engaged not only professional historians, but other scholars and the broader public as well. These are Stefan Stambolov’s dictatorship, the rule of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union under Aleksandur Stamboliiski, the problem of fascism (and the antifascist resistance), and the communist regime. These topics lead to wider issues traced in a long-term perspective. Thus the essay on Stambolov, centered on his “Russophobia” (anti-Russian policies) and his “dictatorship,” provides a perspective on Bulgarian– Russian<br>

  Book Title: Remembering Communism-Private and Public Recollections of Lived Experience in Southeast Europe<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Troebst Stefan<br>
  Abstract: Remembering Communism examines the formation and transformation of the memory of communism in the post-communist period. The majority of the articles focus on memory practices in the post-Stalinist era in Bulgaria and Romania, with occasional references to the cases of Poland and the GDR. Based on an interdisciplinary approach, including history, anthropology, cultural studies and sociology, the volume examines the mechanisms and processes that influence, determine and mint the private and public memory of communism in the post-1989 era. The common denominator to all essays is the emphasis on the process of remembering in the present, and the modalities by means of which the present perspective shapes processes of remembering, including practices of commemoration and representation of the past.<br>

  Author(s) Main Izabella<br>
  Abstract: Historical studies of the period of the Polish People’s Republic (PRL) flourished after 1989 as a result of the newly gained freedom of scholarship and better access to the archives, as well as growing individual, public, and political interest in this topic. A vast number of books, papers, and memoirs have been published. However, a few valuable books dealing with communist history were published before 1989, either as samizdat in Poland, or abroad. While the communist period (1945–1989) itself has a broad bibliography, the issue of remembering communism¹ is less explored. This chapter is a modest attempt to explore<br>

  Abstract: In the beginning was the student, and he has never entirely abandoned the adult who succeeded him. Childhood owes to school as much as it owes to family or neighbors, but this banal truth has not been registered in the archives and has not made history. Almost my entire existence has somehow been related to school, in so many ways: as a school student, university student, history teacher, research fellow in the history of education, university lecturer, and, more recently, mother of a future student.

  Abstract: The relationship “scholar-political regime” and the limits of the admissible compromises, which every intellectual sets according to his/her own ideas about morality, should be of considerable interest to any scholar, at the very least for the purposes of comparison with other fellow-workers. I was interested in those questions, being myself a student of socialism, and especially as a result of my participation in a project at the Institute of History at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 2004–2005. The project dealt with how “the changes” reflected upon the discipline of history in the 1980s. The emphasis was on the<br>

  Abstract: The euphemistically called “revival process,” that is, the policy of the Bulgarian Communist Party aiming at ethnic assimilation of the Turkish minority in Bulgaria in the second half of the 1980s, has been in the scope of my research interests as an important part of contemporary Bulgarian history which I teach at the University of Sofia. At the same time, I have always been aware that the “revival process,” even though it ended in December 1989, is still present as a painful memory.

  Book Title: Remembrance, History, and Justice-Coming to terms with traumatic pasts in democratic societies<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Iacob Bogdan C.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has left behind a painful and complicated legacy of massive trauma, monstrous crimes, radical social engineering, or collective/individual guilt syndromes that were often the premises for and the specters haunting the process of democratization in the various societies that emerged out of these profoundly de-structuring contexts. The present manuscript is a state of the art reassessment and analysis of how the interplay between memory, history, and justice generates insight that is multifariously relevant for comprehending the present and future of democracy without becoming limited to a Europe-centric framework of understanding. The manuscript is structured on three complementary and interconnected trajectories: the public use of history, politics of memory, and transitional justice. Key words 1. Europe, Eastern—Politics and government—1989– 2. Collective memory—Europe, Eastern. 3. Memory—Political aspects—Europe, Eastern. 4. Democratization— Social aspects—Europe, Eastern. 5.

  Abstract: In January 2007, Romania acceded to the European Union (EU), a few years after having entered the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This was a watershed in Romania’s history, a significant moment in the history of Eastern Europe, and a test for the EU’s commitment to accepting problematic candidates as long as they have complied with the major accession requirements. Sometime ago, in a controversial article published in the

  Abstract: The history of Communism in the Republic of Moldova is arguably little-known in the West. Most of the Republic of Moldova was a part of Romania in the interwar period and it is historically, linguistically, and ethnically intertwined with that of Romania. However, one cannot ignore the status of Bessarabia as part of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Bessarabia was the only Soviet territory belonging historically and ethnically to a neighboring state—Communist Romania. Thus, one needs to make an extensive introduction on the nature of Soviet regime in former Moldavian SSR. One also has to answer a<br>

  Author(s) RUPNIK JACQUES<br>
  Abstract: The word “solidarity” has been severely battered about by recent European history. It is part of both the Christian and Socialist traditions. The Communists’ use, and abuse, of the term has largely contributed to its discrediting, with officially proclaimed solidarity becoming identified with the privileges of the ruling caste, while the term “brotherly help” was used to describe the occupation of a country with a different understanding of socialism. The first historical irony was when a Polish workers’ movement in 1980 again gave “solidarity” a good name and rescued it from the so-called United Polish Workers Party (every word in<br>

  Abstract: Apocalypses are of interest not only to antiquarians or religious ideologues. They subtend and rest upon a rich and ubiquitous conception of time which is, as we shall see, of salience to fields far broader than eschatology or of salvation history, and this judgement I believe applies to all apocalypses including those of Islam, all of which treat temporality in a manner that is conceptually isomorphous.

  Abstract: Since the late 1980s, when the changes in Eastern and Central Europe seemed overwhelming and access to previously restricted information grew exponentially, this region could safely claim an unpredictable past. Today, almost two decades after the fall of communist regimes, scholars working on the recent past are paradoxically challenged by the abundance of memory and the variety of witnesses’ accounts, which confront the professional historical narrative with the simple claim “I was there and it was completely different.” Walking down the street, having a family dinner, or flipping through postcards and photo albums, we all make daily inroads into history.<br>

For example, the period 1530-1660 “presents the fastest word growth in the history of English in proportion to the vocabulary size of the time”.³ In the history of language, as in the history of visual culture, the movement we call<br>

It will include history alongside poetry, plays and the prose fiction we describe as “novels”, while contemporaries called them “romances”. In fact, writing was not the only medium in which these works circulated, since oral performances were commonplace. The circulation of texts in performance, manuscript and print suggests that we think in terms of hybrid media.<br>

Whether or not these interactions are part of the Renaissance movement is a more difficult and controversial question. However, the revival of antiquity, especially the “patristic revival” (the renewed interest in Augustine, Jerome and other leading figures of the early Church), was important in the history of Christianity in this period. The writings of the Fathers, which exemplify the Hellenization of Christianity, were influential on Catholics and Protestants alike.<br>

This fluctuation of meaning, I then tried to show, was largely due to the never-ending tension that prevails between the concept ofutopia(literally a “nonplace”) and<br>

  Abstract: One of the most recent and important contributions to Soviet history is that of “Soviet subjectivity” literature. This approach originates in the works of Igal Halfin and Jochen Hellbeck, for both of whom Michel Foucault and post-structuralist theory are major sources of inspiration. Halfin and Hellbeck use the Foucauldian analysis of the creation of subjectivity by power to look at the Stalinist purges in a new way. The self that they write about is not a Cartesian or Kantian self, but rather an intersection of discourses and mechanisms of power. This is a radical version of the linguistic turn in<br>

  Abstract: The present volume offers interdisciplinary analyses of utopian phenomena. The interdisciplinary nature of studies in utopianism (and also in other fields) is becoming more and more accepted, yet the cooperation of the various disciplines in interpretation is not automatic, and their emphases and approaches may differ substantially. As Balázs Trencsényi argues, “historians of political thought try to renegotiate the relationship between history, literary studies and the social sciences, pointing out that the understanding of a political interaction might necessitate the use of a variety of different interpretative techniques and approaches.”¹ Yet interdisciplinarity is not only a technical issue.

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

  Abstract: One of the main intellectual consequences of the French Revolution was to leave many Europeans with the sense that the optimistic, rationalistic and egalitarian ideology of the Enlightenment had exhausted itself and been discredited with the failure of the radical phase of the revolution. There was a sense on many sides that the Enlightenment had been “on trial” during the French Revolution and that the understanding of human nature and history offered by the Enlightenment had proved inadequate. The period that followed the French Revolution was therefore marked by an intellectual reaction leading in two directions. First, to the belief<br>

  Abstract: How does Hurricane Katrina change our understanding of the United States, the lengths and widths of its history, as well as its place in the history of the world? As a catastrophe that casts into doubt the efficacy and security of the nation-state, what alternatives does it suggest, what other forms of shelter, what other ways to organize human beings into meaningful groups? And how might these nonstandard groupings challenge American Studies as a discipline, given their deviations from the foundational norm, and the shape of the future they portend?<br>

  Abstract: In her famous essay on Walter Benjamin, Hannah Arendt summarized his theoretical reflections on history, tradition and authority in the following formula: “Insofar as the past has been transmitted as tradition, it possesses authority; insofar as authority presents itself historically, it becomes tradition.”² We will never know whether Benjamin himself would have endorsed these lines, which clearly show the hand of Arendt. Yet the formula does have the appearance of something that comes close to Benjamin’s very own style of thinking and writing, to such an extent that one could easily take it for a quotation of the “real” Benjamin.³<br>

  Book Title: Imperfection and Defeat-The Role of Aesthetic Imagination in Human Society<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nemoianu Virgil<br>
  Abstract: Literature is defined in a challenging way as the "science" of imperfection and defeat, or else as a type of discourse that deals with defeat, loss, uncertainty in social life, by contrast with virtually all disciplines (hard sciences or social sciences) that affirm certainties and wish to convince us of truths. If in real history most constructive attempts end up in failure, it follows that we ought to have also a field of research that examines this diversity of failures and disappointments, as well as the alternative options to historical evolution and progress. Thus literature serves an indispensable role: that of gleaning the abundance of past existence, the gratuitous and the rejected being placed here on an equal level with the useful and the successful. This provocative and unusual approach is illustrated in chapters that deal with the dialectics between literary writing and such fields as historical writing, or religious discourses, and is also illustrated by the socio-historical development of East-Central Europe.<br>

  Abstract: For some time now I have wanted to try to group and formulate in a brief and coherent way my views about literature and its role in human societies and history, which I have rather consistently expressed in diverse writings. This fortunate opportunity was provided by the Central European University and, more specifically by “Pasts Inc.” and its leader and animator, Professor Sorin Antohi, as a cycle of lectures in Budapest in February/March 2004. The current book is a version of these lectures; it draws from a number of previous writings, but it also rearranges the material and provides additional<br>

  Author(s): Uitz Renáta<br>
  Abstract: Emphasizes the role history and historical narratives play in constitutional adjudication. Uitz provocatively draws attention to the often-tense relationship between the constitution and historical precedence highlighting the interpretive and normative nature of the law. Her work seeks to understand the conditions under which references to the past, history and traditions are attractive to lawyers, even when they have the potential of perpetuating indeterminacy in constitutional reasoning. Uitz conclusively argues that this constitutional indeterminacy is obscured by 'judicial rhetorical toolkits' of continuity and reconciliation that allow the court's reliance on the past to be unaccounted for. Uitz' rigorous analysis and extensive research makes this work an asset to legal scholars and practitioners alike.<br>

  Abstract: References to history and traditions have acquired a curious reputation among lawyers for being objective and neutral points of reference, and thus for being capable of curbing indeterminacy in constitutional adjudication. When inquiring whether a new claim fits within the substantive range of the Due Process Clause, the U.S. Supreme Court sets course to explore whether the right or liberty interest asserted by the petitioner is “deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and tradition.” It was in

  Abstract: The previous chapters sought to demonstrate that—despite lawyers’ intellectual reflexes—accounts of the past, history, and traditions are not hard facts to be taken at face value. Rather, accounts of the past (historical narratives) are the outcome of processes of interpretation. Lawyers’ accounts of the past as presented in constitutional cases are as interpretive as any other historical narrative. The last of these concerns relates closely to a court’s justification for selecting particular segments of the past for the purposes of settling a constitutional problem. When invoked in constitutional cases, arguments from history and traditions are presented as if<br>

First, Polish experiences are seen unique in the region: peculiar factors such as an institutionally strong and independent Catholic Church; the survival of private ownership of land and de-collectivization of agriculture; a history replete with both anti-Russian, anti-Soviet and working class uprisings (in 1831, 1863, 1944, 1956, 1970, 1976, and 1980–1981); the relative power and prowess of intellectuals and the intelligentsia; and the weakness of party-state institutions and elites (Schöpflin, 1983; Ekiert and Kubic, 2001).

  Abstract: Few are the reliable and well-written books that seek to tell the history of recent art in Eastern Europe—that is, the history of work by the artists who crossed the line in time that divided the old, communist era from the new postcommunist one. The communist past as experienced by those who lived it is largely a foreign concept to the majority of art historians in the West, who thus tread hesitantly over its uncanny terrain. As for the new generations of Eastern European art historians, they have already partially forgotten this past or even actively suppressed the memory<br>

Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Juillerat Bernard<br>
Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Abstract: Scholars and their students interested in the field would do well to begin with these studies, despite some unevenness in period, place, and theme. Developments in the twentieth century, for example, are not well served, especially as their globalization bursts all traditional boundaries in the discipline, making a historical perspective essential to an understanding of ongoing transformations in literate life everywhere, not just in the West. Similarly, the absence of illustrations undermines the potential value of these books as introductions to the history of reading. Much of the work here depends on the material objects that readers actually had; without images of them, the reader develops less of a sense of the field. Finally, the exclusion of the essays on correspondence from the original collection is deeply regrettable; Chartier’s summary of their implications in the introduction hardly does justice to them, especially to the important study of the 1847 postal survey by Dauphin and two other colleagues. The translations are generally accurate, but the indexes are barely adequate.<br>

Abstract: While sharing the aim of relating philosophy and theology, I do not think the project is best accomplished by thinking ontotheologically (at least, not in its Heideggerian sense). What is needed is to insist on a sharper distinction between ontotheological philosophy and religious theology so that we can better understand how they might relate. And here again, I agree with Robbins for different reasons: Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Marion are key sources in this project, for their work maintains the distinction that it calls into question.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Hence, our choice of philosophies should not be limited to the two main philosophies identified by Budd but rather could take up ideas from process thinking, which is a quieter but nevertheless relevant philosophy to which LIS should attend. By valuing the processes and articulating this with better abstractions more congruent with our action, we not only further our own project; we also sustain a vital engagement with the projects of individuals. We more clearly articulate the library in the life of the user, to use the words of Wiegand [
      2].<br>

Abstract: However, Somerville often uses strategies very similar to Butler's in seeing the primacy of the sexual. See, e.g., the analysis of Jean Toomer based on the term
            queer(Somerville2000, 136) and the insistence that compulsory heterosexuality is “integral” to the logic of racial segregation (137).<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

ROSEMARY MITCHELL University of Leeds J. G. A. POCocK. [[END 06A00070]] [[START 06A00080]] Barbarism and Religion: Volume Three, The First Decline and Fall. New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the last hundred pages of Pocock's volume and therefore serves as both a climax to the Pocockian story so far, and a bridge to the next volume. Volume one of Barbarism and Religion situated Gibbon intellectually within a number of different European "Enlightenments"; volume two located him on a different axis, among the various writers of "narratives of civil government" in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (We are still missing the parallel vector running through ecclesiastical histori- ography, although Eusebius, Augustine, Orosius, and Otto of Freising figure prominently here. Christianity only begins to signal its importance with chapter fifteen of Gibbon; where he used ecclesiastical author- ities, up to that point, it was to document civil rather than sacred history.) Volume three moves in a third, diachronic dimension, tracing the transformations of key themes, in particular the idea of "decline and fall" itself, from very ancient origins up to the Scot Adam Ferguson's Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (which appeared seven years after Gibbon's first volume and is thus offered for comparison rather than direct influence). The flight of concepts and motifs is dizzying, the lengthy quotations apposite, and as with the previous volumes, one can scarcely miss a sentence without losing a nuance or a parenthetical qualification. The theme of decline and fall, which informs the conception and beginning of Gibbon's book, would eventually yield to "barbarism and reli- gion" as its principal causes in later volumes (along with over-taxation, which Gibbon mentions at the close of chapter fourteen). But behind that idea, which only gradually emerged from Polybian political cycles via medieval notions of the translatio imperii, lay much else, including sequential recognitions of crucial turn- ing points in Roman history going back to Gracchan land reforms in the late second century B.C.E. The core problem, historiographically, remains how to explain why Gibbon, committed from an early stage to a Tacitean narrative, chose to begin his account not with the Julio-Claudians but instead at the "Antonine moment" of imperial zenith achieved by Trajan. (As he once did with cinquecento Florence, Pocock inclines to define major turning points or episodes, both historical and intellectual, in terms of "moments"-a historical Constantinean and historiographical Zosiman moment lie ahead, and the Machiavellian version even puts in a cameo appearance when this volume reaches the early eighteenth century.) Gibbon knew intimately the char- acter of Augustan rule and the flaws of the late republic; he had read his Sallust as well as Tacitus. The later imperial historians, especially Appian of Alexan- dria and Ammianus Marcellinus, also figure in this account as historians of decline, but of a decline that takes a great deal of time-all the way to the "Illyrian" recovery of the late third century-really to become unmistakeable. The subjects confronted by Gibbon's nearly two millennia of predecessors include the military problem of restless troops settling in an empire that has con- quered all its rivals and closed itself off from further expansion; the civic conflict between virtue and cor- ruption (or rather, the way in which virtue leads to military conquest and empire, which in turn produce an oriental softness); the role of the soldiers in making emperors and especially the legions' realization, in the Year of Four Emperors (68/69 C.E.), that emperors could be made "elsewhere than Rome"; the place of the Augustinian-Orosian "two cities" view of history; the vicissitudes in republicanism (an issue revived in the fifteenth century by Leonardi Bruni, who as a non-Roman concerned mainly with Florence was able to see the empire's longue duree for the first time as declinatio rather than translatio and to initiate, though not complete, a gradual transition in historiography from the latter to the former); and the extension of citizenship to the provinces, along, soon, with the capacity of provincials to be proclaimed emperor. All of these streams converge, not entirely satisfactorily AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 470 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure.

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result.

The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992).

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 142 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] accommodates current concerns for inclusion and regard for difference.43 I would even argue that Hofstadter's own liberal position was closer to Foner's than one might at first suspect. Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T.

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here.

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 448 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh a series of rather peripheral white missionaries. Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: Readers without solid background knowledge of French film and colonial history may have some difficulty navigating through Eades's tightly packed, allusive prose, especially since no index of any kind is provided. This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78.

Abstract: These criticisms and oversights notwithstanding, there are many redeeming aspects to the book. Insofar as hermeneutics and exegesis are essential for any understanding of religious texts and traditions, Thistleton's work is a good way to be introduced to a complex history, the thorny debates, and the diverse approaches that have come to constitute its history and development. And the copious references that are made throughout and at the end of each chapter will enable readers to probe more deeply into a thinker, subject, or historical period of interest to them.<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: In sum: while it has it flaws, this book is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the field of theories of religion around. It is worth the cover price for that alone, which makes it definitely recommendable. Those who want to learn about the current state of theory, especially if they tend in the realist direction, will find this book very useful. Constructivists acquainted with theory will likely find it less so.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Author(s): Gutterman David S.<br>
Abstract: Ultimately it is at times unclear what is gained in making these comparisons or if such analysis “enhances our understanding of the relationship between religious narratives and politics” (p. 92). What precisely is revealed in grouping these movements together, other than that political crisis invites prophetic criticism? Gutterman carefully unpacks the readings of shared Biblical texts, and he skillfully details contextual and interpretative differences. But one wishes he had gone beyond these descriptive endeavors to construct a more nuanced account of the relationship between religion and politics and, more importantly, of the specifically religious grounds of the activism he examines. While Gutterman can be theoretically deft—in exploring the relation between narrative and politics (p. 21) or garden/wilderness metaphors (p. 47)—he is not fully engaged with the literature on political religion, often citing unrepresentative figures like William Connolly or Stephen Carter. He is a sharp writer with an eye for interesting problems and material. I applaud his engagement with important issues and also the ambition of his thinking. But his central categories require further explication, and this book speaks to the need for more conversations across disciplines.<br>

Abstract: 3. Jessica Tiffin points out that “from the moment he enters the village, and despite his characterization both in heroic motif and active, masculine past tense, the cyclist's historical nature is subsumed into the unreal space of fairy tale and the Gothic” (85). The shift from the descriptions of the countess in the present tense to the narrative past begins with the words, “One hot, ripe summer day in the pubescent years of the present century, a young officer in the British army, blond, blue-eyed, heavy-muscled, visiting friends in Vienna, decided to spend the remainder of his furlough exploring the little-known uplands of Romania” (Carter, 97).<br>

Abstract: The very centrality of its questions to literary studies may be the greatest handicap for
   Translating Investments.Words That Matter, especially in its recovery of grammatical theory, had more surprises page-for-page. Here the big ideas are perforce more familiar, the innovations more incremental. The reward, however, is a fine sense of metaphor as a cultural project across an especially broad range of terrain in early modern England. Anderson insists, and teaches us to insist, on the local, historical conditions of metaphor’s torpor and vitality, how writers thought about and went about killing and quickening the trope she calls “the scaffolding of human culture” (216).<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Abstract: In his 1986 essay on the intersections between music theory, phenomenology, and perception, David Lewin develops a heuristic model through which to come to terms with the constitution of multiple and heterogeneous perceptions of musical events. One of his principal vehicles for demonstrating this phenomenological turn is the well-known analysis of Schubert's “Morgengruß.” The present article considers the ramifications of Lewin's methodology, particularly with respect to the experience of time that emerges from Lewin's mobilization of the heuristic perception model, by approaching it from the perspective of Husserl's
         Phenomenology of Internal Time Consciousness. This perspective reveals a superposition of temporalities as well as a superposition of languages as the underlying factors through which Lewin's analysis is produced.<br>

Abstract: Examen de dos textos generados por la masacre estudiantil de la Plaza de Tlatelolco en 1968:
         Postdatade Octavio Paz yLa noche de Tlatelolcode Elena Ponioatowska. La visión totalizadora de Paz interpreta el evento como proveedor de respuestas a las cuestiones planteadas acerca de la nación enEl laberinto de la soledad, e insiste en la necesidad de reescribir la historia de México bajo el eje de una nueva genealogía. El libro de Poniatowska, en cambio, se rige por la fragmentación y la pluralidad, para transmitir las frecuentes voces disonantes de la sociedad civil. El análisis examina los modos en que la forma literaria representa relaciones entre la violencia, la justicia y la estética.<br>

Abstract: Más que hacer un recorrido a través de la vasta producción historiográfica mexicana de los últimos 20 años (1984-2004), el artículo pretende analizar las condiciones de desarrollo institucional a partir de las cuales se ha desenvuelto dicha producción historiográfica. Los sistemas de evaluación desarrollados a partir del Sistema Nacional de Investigadores cobran un papel relevante. Asimismo, se pone énfasis en el surgimiento de las nuevas generaciones de historiadores, en los nuevos temas que se han incorporado a los tradicionalmente tratados y en el contraste entre las nuevas propuestas de los historiadores provenientes de los resultados de las investigaciones y las interpretaciones a que han dado lugar y la resistencia del público, moldeado por la inercia de la historia oficial. El artículo está deliberadamente planteado con títulos y elementos de don Luis González, a cuya memoria está dedicado.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the novel
         Cementerio de Papel[Paper Cemetery] (2002), a detective thriller about a murder that took place under the dome of the Archivo General de la Nación [National General Archive] (Lecumberri). The relocation and opening of the files of the former Dirección Federal de Seguridad [Federal Security Bureau] in the former prison comes along with the return of victims and victimizers, only now they come back as ghosts of things past. The novel works with the binomial jail/archive, featuring Lecumberri as a live space from which to begin a search for justice and truth, without sinking into melancholy or victimhood.<br>

Abstract: In nearly thirty densely argued pages, Gottfried Weber (1832) analyzed four measures from Mozart's"Dissonance" Quartet; the "ear" subjects each note and chord to multiple possible interpretations. This paper examines Weber's interpretive practice in light of his theory of harmony, considering his cognitive teasing of potential meanings from the perspective of philosophical notions of consciousness (Kant and Fichte) and the poetics of self-reflective subjectivity proposed by the Early Romantics (F.Schlegel and Novalis) in their critiques of linguistic representation, temporality,and subject-object relations.The Early Romantic conception of irony and allegory brings the subject fully within the fold of linguistic representation, as does Weber,marking a key moment in the history of the representation of listening by music theory.<br>

Abstract: 3. A brief account of the crucial role of the 1790s in these developments, focusing on the complementary achievements of Haydn and Beethoven. For Beethoven, Haydn's and Mozart's music was, precisely, modern. Together, he and Haydn dominated the Viennese scene, producing ever-more-imposing masterworks in every genre except opera. This explicitly modernist orientation was fostered, if not indeed in part created, by their patrons. After 1800 Beethoven maintained and further developed this same tradition. These years "between" Enlightenment and Romanticism were no mere transition; they constituted an equally weighty phase, on the same historical-structural "level," as those that preceded and followed it. Concomitantly, Romanticism as such did not become predominant in music until 1815, in Viennese music (except for the Lied) perhaps not even until 1828/30. For both reasons, it makes sense to regard the beginning of the music-historical nineteenth century as having been "delayed," until around 1815 or 1830.<br>

Abstract: By utilizing the textual products of extraterrestrial-inspired religious thinkers like George Van Tassel, Raël, and Patricia Cori, as well as related materials by Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin, this article explores the concept of revisionism in ET-inspired religions. The authors examined in this article reread ancient religious texts, especially the Bible, as containing evidence of extraterrestrial influence in the course of human history. The anatomy of this "drive to revise" human history is explored, including an examination of how an improvisational millenarianism combines with a cultic milieu suspicious of authority and hegemonic narratives, and the conspiratorial intellectual maverick willing to work with "stigmatized" knowledge to produce narratives that are highly critical and suspicious of established intellectual authorities and procedures.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: On enigma as a rhetorical figure: a brief history in the rhetoricians, encyclopedists, and patristic commentators from Aristotle to Dante's time, with a rhetorical analysis of the figure. Special attention is given to Augustine in the
         De trinitateXV on St. Paul's well-known "in aenigmate" (I Cor.13:12). Some implications of Augustine's linking of the figurative and the figural (typological, historical) are considered, with a re-examination of Auerbach's "Figura" on this question. The importance for our own reading of rhetoric in relation to history and poetry is stressed.<br>

Abstract: AbstractBeginning with Roland Barthes' “The Old Rhetoric: an aide-mémoire” (1964–65), semioticians have shown a remarkable interest in the history of rhetoric. Writers like Barthes, Tzevtan Todorov, Gérard Genette, and Paul Ricoeur have offered accounts of rhetoric's past that invariably concluded with rhetoric's demise and its replacement with semiotics. These writers typically portray rhetoric's history as one of a brief rise followed by a very long decline, a pattern, says Todorov, of “splendor and misery.” This essay examines the semioticians' predictions of rhetoric's demise as well as semiotics' attempt to claim elements of rhetoric as its own. The essay concludes by considering the present state of semiotics' aspiration to supersede rhetoric as a theory of language and human affairs.<br>

Abstract: Memoria Abierta's work responds to the need for a dialogue in Argentina among human rights organizations, the government, and civil society that will stimulate the formation of a collective memory about the history of State-led terrorism in the country. Processing documents, testimonies, and images related to the history of illegal repression in Argentina (c. 1974–1983), and creating a topographical reconstruction of the locations where State-led terrorism occurred poses diverse ethical, technical, and political problems regarding the recollection, description, transmission, and diffusion of the materials of memory. This article describes some of these challenges and how they affect and are shaped by the work of Memoria Abierta.<br>

Abstract: Although narrative inquiry has a long intellectual history both in and out of education, it is increasingly used in studies of educational experience. One theory in educational research holds that humans are storytelling organisms who, individually and socially, lead storied lives. Thus, the study of narrative is the study of the ways humans experience the world. This general concept is refined into the view that education and educational research is the construction and reconstruction of personal and social stories; learners, teachers, and researchers are storytellers and characters in their own and other's stories. In this paper we briefly survey forms of narrative inquiry in educational studies and outline certain criteria, methods, and writing forms, which we describe in terms of beginning the story, living the story, and selecting stories to construct and reconstruct narrative plots. Certain risks, dangers, and abuses possible in narrative studies are discussed. We conclude by describing a two-part research agenda for curriculum and teacher studies flowing from stories of experience and narrative inquiry.<br>

Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Abstract: This article discusses how T. S. Eliot's long poem, Four Quartets, employs the thematics of time, self, and history in an autobiographical work of literature. The article approaches autobiography primarily as an intellectual concern, rather than as a factual account of the author's life, in examining a work that is difficult to subsume under available interpretive paradigms. The first part of the article emphasizes how Augustine's Confessions, when considered as a meditation on time and religious experience, illuminates the hermeneutics of Four Quartets. The second and central part of the article provides close readings of key passages in this poem, which inscribes Greek cosmology and medieval epic in a narrative of literary development and spiritual change. The third and concluding part of the article explores how the author's later poetry and criticism highlight major tendencies in twentieth-century literature and anticipate the postmodern interpretation of history. / تعالج هذه المقالة قصيدة ﺇﻟﻴﻮﺕ الطويلة أربع رباعيات من منطلق جديد وبالرجوع إلى تيمات الزمن والذات والتاريخ في السيرة الذاتية الأدبية٠ وتتعامل المقالة مع السيرة الذاتية لا باعتبارها سجلاﹰ لما جرى في حياة صاحبها من أحداث، بل ابعتبارها سجلاﹰ مضمراﹰ للتطور الذهني لكاتبها٠ يقوم الجزء الأول من المقالة بتوظيف البعد ﺍﻟﺘﺄﻣﻠﻲ في الزمن وفي التجربة الدينية كما ورد عند القديس أوغسطين في سيرته الذاتية الاعترافات، لإضاءة المدار التأويلي لقصيدة أربع رباعيات٠ ويقوم الجزء الثاني بتحليل مقاطع رئيسية في القصيدة، مبرزاﹰ ما تتضمنه وما تلوّح به من معتقدات كونية إغريقية وملاحم وسيطية٠ أما الجزء الثالث والأخير فيتوصل إلى أن ذهنية إليوت، بالإضافة إلى كونها تعكس التوجه العام للأدب في القرن العشرين، تمهد للتفسير ما بعد الحداثي للتاريخ٠<br>

Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Abstract: The title of this essay comes from contemporary hermeneutics, a branch of philosophy devoted to interpretation. It refers to the domain between a human artifact and a beholder. Brought to architecture, this worldly concept implicitly questions the conventional role of the individual amidst historical works. It also offers a common ground on which products of architectural interpretation (performances or fictions) may begin to engage our normally independent territories of history and design. This essay examines the concept of the world in front of the work and speculates on its implications for architectural education. The illustrations portray interpretive projects by the author's students.<br>

Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroastrian theology. Zoroastrianism proclaims a movement through time from dualism toward monotheism, i.e., a dualism which is being made false by the dynamics of time, and a monotheism which is being made true by those same dynamics of time. The meaning of the eschaton in Zoroastrianism is thus the triumph of monotheism, the good God Ahura Mazdā having at last won his way through to complete and final ascendancy. But in the meantime there is vital truth to dualism, the neglect of which can only lead to a distortion of the religion's essential teachings. We develop this interpretation in the last part of our paper and argue for its satisfaction of the four criteria.<br>

Abstract: In recent years personal construct theory has become increasingly used to underpin research into teachers' thinking, and a number of researchers have opted to give methodological prominence to the repertory grid. This paper points to the limitations of the theory in respect of research outside the domain of psychotherapy and to some of the problems associated with repertory grid studies. It is argued that repertory grids are inherently positivistic and are thus in philosophical tension with the theory on which they are based, a tension that is not removed by researching in a 'conversation paradigm'. The importance of events in personal construct theory is discussed, and it is suggested that an emphasis on events requires the researcher to adopt an approach that is informed by phenomenology and the philosophy of history. Finally, a return is made to the level of research practice,i and a methodological approach is outlined which is-to a greater extent than the repertory grid-consistent with the main thrust of personal construct theory. Stress is given to the importance of the quality of the relationships between constructs, since these have implications for connections between construing and action-an issue which is of crucial importance is the study of teachers' thinking.<br>

Abstract: This study of organised political violence in north-central Nicaragua from 1926 to 1934 focuses on the infamous Conservative gang leader Anastacio Hernandez and on Sandino's rebels. The contexts of a weak central state and local-regional caudillismo are outlined. It is shown that after the 1926-27 civil war. Hernandez and others produced ritualised spectacular violence in the service of their Chamorrista caudillo patrons. The language, practices, and characteristics of organised violence are examined. It is argued that Sandino's rebels appropriated these tools of political struggle, and that changes and continuities in the organisation of violence in Nicaraguan history merit greater attention.<br>

Abstract: This commentary article focuses on a crucial moment in the formation of Peruvian Creole nationalism: the 1836-9 Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation. Nationalist sentiments expressed through the anti-confederationist press, satiric poetry and pamphlets, glorified the Inca past while spurning the Indian present. During this period, a nationalist, essentially racist, rhetoric whose roots can be traced to the late eighteenth century, took shape. This rhetoric would provide the foundations of an ideology which has prevailed in Peruvian history. This rhetoric reached its peak in the twentieth century, while evolving into a historiographical discourse instrumental to the exercise of power and which is now in crisis.<br>

Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Abstract: Taylor, it has to be noted, would presumably quarrel
with this "either/or" formulation, either interpret the
classics or interpret the world. His Hegel book obvi-
ously falls within the genre of commentary on the tradi-
tion. Furthermore, in the preface to its condensation as
Hegel and Modern Society, he emphasizes the relevance
of Hegel's political philosophy to our time (1979, pp. xi-
xii)

Abstract: This paper reflects on the implications of postmodern political discourse for East-Asian politics. It argues that the postmodernist deconstruction of modern epistemology and politics provides an opportunity for the reappraisal and rehabilitation of Confucianism in East Asia. First, the paper begins with an account of Cartesian epistemology which undergirds the liberal conceptions of selfhood and politics. Second, it provides a brief history of the Neo-Confucian synthesis and the resulting epistemology based on an intersubjective and ethical understanding of being human. Third, it gives an account of how East Asian thinkers have until recently tried to overcome Confucianism as a way of achieving modernity. Fourth, it attempts to show how the Heideggerian deconstruction of Cartesian epistemology reveals the intersubjective and ethical nature of Dasein which allows for a reevaluation of Confucianism. Fifth, this paper describes earlier attempts by East Asians to go beyond modernity and the way they have led to detrimental consequences. It concludes that the current debate should proceed with a more careful and balanced consideration of both modernity and Confucianism.<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the interactive relationship of memory and history during the ethnographic research process, using as its case study interviews with Syrian Jews about a hymn (pizmon) repertory. The paper uses strategies of the new historicism as well as concepts from psychology, literary theory and anthropology to explore ways in which ethnomusicologists are instrumental both in eliciting memories and in constructing historical narratives.<br>

Author(s): Hall John R.<br>
Abstract: Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.<br>

Abstract: Johannes Fabian's "Time and the Other" criticized anthropology for creating representations that placed the Other outside the flow of time. Fabian offered the ethnographic portrayal of coevalness as a solution to this problem. This article explores four challenges to the representation of coevalness: the split temporalities of the ethnographer; the multiple temporalities of different histories; the culturally influenced phenomenological present; and the complicated relationship between culturally variable concepts of being and becoming and cultural concepts of time. Based on these challenges, this article argues that some attempts at ethnographic coevalness have fostered a temporal framework of homochronism which subsumes the Other into academic discourses of history. To achieve coevalness and to avoid homochronism and allochronism, it is necessary to represent the temporal frameworks that research subjects use to forge coevalness with ethnographers, and to place these frameworks in relationship to commonly used academic representations of time and history. /// Dans son livre "Le Temps et les Autres," Johannes Fabian critiquait la création par l'anthropologie de représentations plaçant l'Autre en dehors du flux du temps. Selon lui, la description ethnographique de la contemporanéité pourrait être la solution à ce problème. Le présent article explore les quatre difficultés que pose la représentation de la contemporanéité: temporalités dissociées de l'ethnographe, temporalités multiples des différentes histoires, présent phénoménologique culturellement informé, relation complexe entre les concepts culturellement variables de l'être et du devenir et les concepts culturel du temps. Sur la base de ces difficultés, l'auteur avance que certaines tentatives de contemporanéité ethnographique ont suscité un cadre temporel d'homochronie qui subsume l'Autre dans les discours académiques sur l'histoire. Pour parvenir à la contemporanéité et éviter homochronie et allochronie, il est nécessaire de représenter les cadres temporels utilisés par les enquêtés pour forger la contemporanéité avec les ethnographes et de resituer ces cadres en relation avec les représentations académiques du temps et de l'histoire qui prévalent habituellement.<br>

Author(s): Bowden Brett<br>
Abstract: As a tool for understanding the world in which we live the study of the history of political thought is stunted because of a preoccupation with the Western canon as the history of political thought to the exclusion of other histories and traditions. This ongoing exclusion is itself facilitated by a deeply entrenched select reading of the Western canon; a reading that overlooks a tendency within the canon to not just ignore but suppress and dismiss the value of other accounts of history and traditions of thought. An opening of the Western mind to these assumed to be alien traditions of social, legal and political thought reveals that, in the global market place of ideas, these purportedly competing and non-compatible traditions of thought might in fact have considerably more in common than what sets them apart: thus opening the way for an authentic inter-civilisational dialogue that focuses more on co-operation and less on clashes.<br>

Abstract: This reflection on Errington's thought-provoking paper, by an intellectual historian and a student of Chinese philosophy, does not dispute her interpretive position on classical Malay literature in general and on hikayat in particular. Rather, it attempts to challenge three salient points of her argument: that the distinction between "oral" and "written" is a hazy one in the paratactic style of the hikayat; that the "images" in this type of literature are flat, repetitive and without content; and that the Malay art of story-telling is diametrically opposed to the rhetorical style of history characteristic of the post-Renaissance West. It is hoped that such a discussion will bring about fruitful encounters between scholars in different fields and disciplines in Asian studies.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author argues that many of the best practices of oral history reflect phenomenological thinking even though practitioners may not describe themselves as using phenomenological methods. The author suggests that knowledge and application of phenomenology can clarify or minimize such potential problems as interviewer bias and informant unreliability and can refute accusations that oral history is less reliable than history taken from documents.<br>

Abstract: Chile's collective memory has been brutalized by state-implemented terrorism. This historical process has resulted in, among other things, a "torn collective memory." The history and memory of the period of so-called popular power (1970-1973) continue to be largely unknown. Oral history allows us to begin a slow process of historical reconstruction as well as to reflect on the construction of militant memories.<br>

Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Unquestionable as history may seem, there are all the same quite different readings and disparate inferences despite the same series of facts. This goes to show that even professional historians can sometimes be overcome by meditations on past possibilities of bifurcations. As to "alternatives to actual history," is serves well to bear in mind that few are plausible, but that belief in a predeterminative universe of necessities would certainly be misplaced. Whereas some occurrences are clear-cut enough to make us understand which components would have had to be changed in order to get a different outcome, others are of such a high degree of complexity that attempts to imagine an alternative course and divergent results remain rather illusory: the examples of Midway (the former type) and the defeat of France in 1940 (intricately overdetermined) clearly show that it pays in any case, in defiance to all complexities, to consider past potential. It is prerequisite for choosing between future options in more reasonable and efficient ways than hitherto.<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'efforce de montrer comment le roman de John Barth LETTERS opère une réorientation radicale de la relation classique entre histoire et fiction. Glissant de la représentation incertaine du réel dans la fiction — et de l'Histoire dans l'histoire — à la notion plus productive du réel comme fiction, LETTERS utilise le discours de/et sur l'Histoire comme une métaphore de la fiction qui éclaire de façon précieuse le fonctionnement du récit. This essay attempts to show how John Barth's novel LETTERS radically reorients the classical relationship between history and fiction. Shifting from the uncertain representation of the real inside the fiction — and of History within the story — to the more productive notion of the real as a fiction, LETTERS uses the discourse of/and about History as a metaphor of fiction which sheds valuable light on the functioning of the narrative.<br>

Abstract: White Noise can be considered, in Leclair's terms, as « a systems novel », like Gravity's Rainbow or The Public Burning; yet, it is also acutely concerned with history in the making and with the fictionalization of the present through its instant recycling by the media. The narrator and protagonist shifts from a total involvement in the present moment to a tragic preoccupation with his individual future after the pollution alert, but he is never able to achieve that « refiguration » which, for Ricœur, constitutes the main strategy to try and beat the aporia of time.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur distills this point well: "When we discover that there are
several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,
Ill., 1965], p. 278).

Abstract: The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the "political culture concept" in the social sciences. Surprisingly, Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number 2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.<br>

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of history in the adjudication of debates on postcolonialism and modernity in India has resulted in the relegation of the knowledge claims of `classical' performance traditions and aesthetic concepts to the domain of the essentializing and the untrustworthy. This paper argues that performances of music and dance have preserved an understanding of tradition that is more dynamic and agential than that put forward by nationalist understandings of tradition, and that aesthetic conceptions continue to illuminate the values and efficacy of these practices in engaging the affects of spectators. The paper explores in particular the subject position of the rasika as offering a distinctive way of inhabiting the present. The class privilege implicit in being able to take up such an invitation is explored in the second part of the paper. La longue domination de l'histoire dans l'orientation des débats sur le post-colonialisme et la modernité en Inde a relégué les prétentions au statut de savoir des arts performatifs et des concepts esthétiques « classiques » au domaine des choses essentialisantes et peu fiables. Le présent article fait valoir que les performances de musique et de danse ont préservé une compréhension de la tradition plus dynamique et agentielle que celle mise en avant dans les interprétations nationalistes, et que les conceptions esthétiques continuent de mettre en lumière les valeurs et l'efficacité de ces pratiques en faisant appel aux affects des spectateurs. L'article explore en particulier la position de sujet du rasika comme une manière différente d'habiter le présent. Le privilège de classe, implicite dans la possibilité d'accepter une telle invitation, est exploré dans la deuxième partie de l'article.<br>

Abstract: A small section of the Goan elite sought political and civil rights and founded the Partido Indiano (Indian Party) in 1865 in the village of Orlim. It enjoyed mass support particularly of the local Catholics. The rival party was the pro-establishment Partido Ultramarino. The violence that ensued in Margao in 1890 during the municipal elections is known as the 21 September Revolt. It lasted for a mere 20 minutes though the military firing killed 12 persons on the spot besides injuring many more. Protest meetings were held not just in Goa but also in Bombay, Poona, Karachi and Zanzibar. Even the Canadian and American press condemned the brutality and carried news on the "Goa Revolution". This article brings out the history of that revolt in the context of the working of colonialism in Goa.<br>

Abstract: This article explores socio-cultural practices with regard to aging women in Vārāṇāsī, a city in North India. It is based on 17 months of field research carried out in 1999—2000 among marginalized Hindu women. I argue that aging is a continuous process that is characterized by the specific psychological patterns that form throughout a woman's life history. These patterns are demonstrated by women's particular types of behaviors and demeanors and, in turn, permit others to ascribe to them—in varying combinations and ratios—specific cultural values or qualities. I argue that these attributes are the critical ones that inform the cultural construction and designation of being 'middle-aged' and 'older' as it pertains to Hindu women of Vārāṇāsī.<br>

Abstract: The ultramodern condition represents the "third wave" in postmodernist-inspired philosophy and cultural practice. Two of ultramodernism's critical theoretical components are the human/social forces, flows, and assemblages that sustain transgression; and the human/social intensities, fluctuations, and thresholds that make transcendence possible as both will and way. In the ultramodern age, then, transcendence is about overcoming and transforming the conditions (i.e., forces, flows, and assemblages) that co-produce harm-generating (i.e., transgressive) tendencies. This manuscript problematizes transgression by way of ultramodern theory. This critical investigation represents "the phenomenology of the shadow," or the ultramodern philosophy of harm. To contextualize this phenomenology and philosophy, the intellectual history of ultramodern thought is recounted. This includes a review of the shadow construct by way of its prominent socio-cultural, psychoanalytic, and political-economic currents; and a chronicling of the reification process (regarding risk, captivity, and harm) since the modernist era (i.e., the industrial revolution). The article concludes with some very speculative observations concerning "the phenomenology of the stranger," or the ultramodern philosophy of transcendence as both will and way.<br>

Abstract: This paper serves as an introduction to this special edition of the International Journal of Historical Archaeology on the theme of archaeology, memory and oral history. Recent approaches to oral history and memory destabilise existing grand narratives and confront some of the epistemological assumptions underpinning scientific archaeology. Here we discuss recent approaches to memory and explore their impact on historical archaeology, including the challenges that forms of oral and social memory present to a field traditionally defined by the relationship between material culture and text. We then review a number of themes addressed by the articles in this volume.<br>

Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: Disciplina acuñada en el XIX, la filología surge como historicidad fundamental, identificando la significación de una obra con sus condiciones de producción originarias, un discurso de la ciencia (historia) sobre la lengua y la literatura. La hermenéutica contemporánea supone una ruptura de la razón histórico-filológica y una afirmación de los nuevos significados que a un texto se le añaden al pasar de un contexto cultural u otro nuevo. Para la filología, el criterio pedagógico único de explicación de los textos es la restitución de la intención deliberada y originaria del autor. Hermenéutica y teoría de la literatura afirman que no hay adecuación lógica necesaria entre sentido de la obra e intención de autor. Tras la “muerte del autor” del formalismo semiótico, la posmodernidad niega el texto mismo y afirma que éste tiene tantos sentido como lectores. A discipline minted in the 19th century, philology, emerges as a fundamental historicist approach, identifying the significance of a work with its original conditions of production, a discourse from science (history) about language and literature. Contemporary hermeneutics assumes a break with historical-philological reason, as well as an affirmation of the new meanings added to a text by passing from one cultural context to another new one. For philology, the only pedagogical criterion in explaining texts is the restitution of deliberate and original authorial intent. Hermeneutics and literary theory assert that there is no logical association necessary between the meaning of the work, and authorial intent. Since the “death of the author” of semiotic formalism, postmodernity has denied the text itself, instead asserting that it has as many meanings as it has readers.<br>

Abstract: Mythical configurations of a personal deity and a dominant sexual identity are part of our western history. In particular, the religious myths of patriarchy have privileged a male God and devalued female desire—and, with her desire, sexual difference. There can be no facile way beyond these myths. Instead the proposal here is for feminist theologians to attempt new configurations of old myths and disruptive refigurations, i.e. transformative mimesis, of biased beliefs. Myth and mimesis can enable expression of multiple identities. Only identities-in-process preserve the possibility for a peaceful revolution of our desires and our differences, religious and sexual.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets John Sayles' 1996 film Lone Star as a reflection on how a community whose history is steeped in violence, such as the US, should seek to manage its difficult cultural memory. A conceptual triad of love, justice, and tragedy utilised to interpret the film's last line, 'Forget the Alamo.' It is concluded that the memory of a troubled past can only serve as the basis for responsible public life when we, like the characters in Lone Star, choose to remember with a charity that liberates both our ancestors and our selves from having to play out the roles of hero or villain.<br>

Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Abstract: In this article alternative history is regarded not as a postmodern genre of Since Fiction but as a universal mode of thinking and storytelling. Its research is especially effective in discussions of historical-mythical pseudo-chronicles of lost civilizations, such as Agnon's Ir u-mloa, his Holocaust opus magnum. The article is devoted to the story from this volume "In Search of a Rabbi, or The Spirit of the Ruler" (Ha-mekhapsim lahem rav, o be-ruakh ha-moshel). The method lays open the author's complex historical and historiographic conceptions hidden in plots and characters, as well as in symbols of historical alternativeness such as "Crusher of Grits" (Kotesh grisin).<br>

Abstract: Es wird der Begriff der „Lebensgeschichte“ zur Diskussion gestellt. Am Beispiel ausgewählter Therapie-Konzeptionen (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) wird gezeigt, daß in jeder therapeutischen Richtung verschiedene Segmente des lebensgeschichtlichen Problemfeldes isoliert, ausgearbeitet und zum Ansatzpunkt des therapeutischen Handelns gemacht werden. Die entsprechenden Konsequenzen für Diagnostik, Therapie und Forschung werden im Blick auf aktuelle Strömungen der therapeutischen Psychoanalyse (Ich-Psychologie, Narzißmus-Analyse, Repräsentanzenlehre, hermeneutische Psychoanalyse) verdeutlicht. The concept of „life history“ is the theme of this discussion. Working from a selection of therapy models (Dührssen, Cremerius, Loch, Kohut, Morgenthaler) it can be shown that in every therapeutic approach various segments from the problem area of life histories in general can be isolated, developed and made into the central point of therapeutic activity. The relevant consequences for diagnosis, therapy and research will be clarified with respect to present-day movements in therapeutic psychoanalysis (ego-psychology, the analysis of narcissism, hermeneutic psychoanalysis).<br>

Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Currently, epistemological debates on the formation of concepts in the field of history are close to nonexistent. For that reason alone, this book written by philosopher of history Doris Gerber - with which she earned her habilitation degree at the University of Tübingen - is a welcome addition to the literature in the field. In this work, Gerber addresses the metaphysical question of what "history" really is. In this study, she considers approaches typically adopted within the field of history, and questions whether the intention to act is essential in writing history, or whether it is even required in the first place. The findings of the four reviewers that follow are diverse in their opinion of this provocative study.<br>

Abstract: Original Sin is considered to be a uniquely Christian doctrine. Nevertheless, an analysis of apparently forgotten Jewish treatises — most of which are to be found only in manuscript form — reveals that an extraordinary philosophical theory of Original Sin is present in late medieval Jewish thought. It implies, therefore, a new dimension in characterising this doctrine and has implications for the understanding of the process of inter-communicating of Jewish and Christian thought. This study focuses on fundamental Jewish passages, beginning with Apocalyptic literature and ending with medieval philosophical texts. Yet, the examination of those Hebrew texts is carried out in the light of the writing of Christian scholars. This means that the attempt to clarify this Jewish doctrine is made, from a methodological viewpoint, both by looking at the development of this doctrine trough the history of the Jewish thought, and by a close examination of the parallel general sources. It is only then that one can see that rudiments of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin were inserted into the Aristotelian theory of Nature, and combined with elements from Maimonides' Biblical-allegoric exegesis.<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with those of West European societies (especially that of Greece with the founding of the « city » from about 1200 B.C.) where Man was not essentially identifield with Nature.<br>

Abstract: Public administration is inherently an interdisciplinary field, prominently incorporating theory and methods from economics, political science, and sociology. Less obviously, however, MPA curricula include historical treatments of particular policy arenas, institutions, the administrative state, and the professions of policy analyst and public management. In addition, the case method that figures prominently in MPA pedagogy and the research MPA students perform depend on doing history. Yet, history as a scholarly endeavor is rarely included in basic courses, much less instruction in research methods. This essay explores the use of history in MPA curricula and how MPA students might acquire a deeper appreciation of history and how historians ply their craft.<br>

Abstract: This forum gathers together a set of essays composed in response to the 2011 special issue of Religion & Literature 42.1–2, titled "Something Fearful": Medievalist Scholars on the "Religious Turn" in Literary Criticism, edited by Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and Jonathan Juilfs. The forum's ten authors reflect both on essays within the original volume and on the broader questions engaged by it and through its very publication; responsive remarks from Kathryn Kerby-Fulton and two contributors to that initiating volume conclude the conversation. Through conversation, response, and critical engagement, the forum's contributors weigh questions of the language of belief in scholarly discourse, of the continuities of religious practice across history, of the assumptions and beliefs undergirding critical work on religion and literature and culture, and of the acknowledgement of the religious convictions of medievalists' scholarly subjects, scholars, and the communities of both.<br>

Abstract: This article considers two revenants – a man and a ghost – who haunt the Fann Psychiatric Clinic in Dakar, Senegal. Following Derrida's assertion that haunting is historical, I take seriously the concept of haunting and insist upon its relevance to anthropological inquiry. As a mode of storytelling that comes from a particular way of apprehending the world, I argue that anthropology might give credence to specters as social figures and assign ethnography the task of chasing after ghosts, not simply for the poetic spaces they may open up but out of a concern for justice and responsibility in the past, present, and future. My own ethnographic encounter with the two revenants described here has generated questions about the often taken-for-granted equivalence of the real and the true. Likewise, it has encouraged me to interrogate the unpredictable (and oftentimes uneasy) cohabitation of memory and history, both within the Fann Clinic and beyond.<br>

Abstract: The present article argues that Hélène Berr's Journal goes well beyond mere testimony to provide an astute analysis not only of the persecutory measures, arrests, camps, and deportations but also of the various attempts to camouflage the violence and even of the wider implications of what she ultimately recognized to be a systematic extermination. Hélène Berr thus presents an extraordinary case of a young French Jewish student at the Sorbonne who, steeped in literature but untrained in history, nevertheless achieved a degree of historical lucidity that, in view of the confused, limited, and often unreliable information available to her in Nazi-occupied Paris, we can only consider as remarkable. Above all, Hélène Berr's very personal confrontation with history, as it unfolded in all the sinister complexity of what we now know as the Holocaust, enables us to better understand these events in the human terms in which they were experienced and with the ethical dimensions that they take on for us today.<br>

Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized the truth-value of memory and the very act of remembering the past.<br>

Abstract: L'histoire quantitative aujourd'hui n'est plus à la mode. Pendant une génération, aux lendemains de la seconde guerre mondiale, elle a constitué pour les historiens français une pratique dominante, et la référence par rapport à laquelle furent longtemps jaugées les manières de faire de l'histoire. La tendance aujourd'hui s'est inversée. Le doute s'est répandu quant à la capacité du chiffre à rendre compte des compartements les plus fondamentaux. En examinant certaines manières de faire de l'histoire quantitative toujours fructueuses et en se gardant de certaines impasses, on cherche à montrer que la démonstration historique ne peut se ramener ni à une logique de la persuasion, ni à une logique de la narration. Les critères de sa pertinence doivent s'apprécier à l'articulation de la définition d'une problématique, des modalités de sa mise en oeuvre expérimentale, et de la confrontation au démenti des données empiriques des propositions historiques. Quantitative history is no longer in fashion. For a generation after the Second World War, it was the usual practice for French historians and the reference for judging work in history. This frame of trend has now been reversed. Doubt has spread concerning the capacity of numbers to explain the most important behaviours. While taking in consideration different styles of research in quantitative history which are always fruitful, and being aware of certain kinds of types of deadlocks, one wants to show how historic demonstration must never be pure persuasion nor pure story. The criteria of its pertinency must be appreciated adequately between the definition of problematic and of testing ground, and in confrontation between empirical data and historical assertions.<br>

Abstract: In Colombia, society has come to be organized in terms of a division between those with and those without links to narcotrafficking. This moral boundary recently experienced a symbolic disturbance with the entrance on the country's cultural scene of Andrés López López, a former Colombian drug trafficker, and his El cartel de los sapos (2008). An examination of the discursive and political strategies employed in this book, in which drug trafficking is referred to through the metaphor "bacteria," allows us to understand the construction of a narrator who calls attention to the hypocrisy of the government and society regarding the reincorporation of narcotraffickers into civilian life while provoking a national debate on the difference between history and fiction. En Colombia, la sociedad ha llegado a organizarse en términos de una división entre aquellos que tienen y no vínculos con el narcotráfico. Este límite moral experimentó un reciente disturbio simbólico con la entrada de Andrés López López, un ex-narcotraficante colombiano, y su libro El cartel de los sapos (2008) en la escena cultural del país. Un análisis de las estrategias discursivas y políticas empleadas en este libro, en el que el tráfico de drogas se define a través de la metáfora de la "bacteria," nos permite entender la construcción de un narrador que devela la hipocresía gubernamental y social con respecto a la reincorporación de los narcotraficantes en la vida civil al mismo tiempo que provoca un debate nacional sobre la diferencia entre historia y ficción.<br>

Abstract: The article comprises three parts. Part I contains an overview of the areas in the analysis of modern French philosophy that have been of the greatest relevance to Russian researchers over the last years. We conclude that numerous aspects of the French philosophical thought of the twentieth century are well represented in the research of Russian authors, who also point out the emerging trends in its development. Part II deals with the development of analytic philosophy in Russia within the framework of such areas as "critique of bourgeois philosophy", a purely ideological stand only nominally related to philosophy, logic, and the history of philosophy and theoretical research. Part III contains a periodization of the history of phenomenology in Russia, pointing out the most important achievements of the contemporary Russian scholars of phenomenology as well as their understanding of the essence, the problems, and the aims of phenomenological philosophy. We also indicate the tendencies within the development of the discipline in the Russian Federation.<br>

Abstract: Même si ce n'était pas l'objet de ce travail, et outre les féconds prolongements de l'anthro-
pologie historique déjà évoqués au début de cet article, il faut rappeler les fructueux échanges
empiriques que les historiens, en particulier pour le Moyen Âge, ont pu avoir depuis vingt ans avec
différents courants de l'anthropologie, qu'il s'agisse par exemple de l'anthropologie juridique dans
le cadre des débats sur la mutation de l'an mil (cf. les travaux de Dominique Barthélémy [1997,
1999]), de l'anthropologie visuelle de chercheurs comme Hans Belting (cf. Schmitt [2002];
ou Baschet [2008]), de l'anthropologie des pratiques d'écriture dans la lignée de Jack Goody
(pour une présentation synthétique de l'historiographie médiévale dans ce domaine, cf. Chastang
[2008]), de l'anthropologie économique (avec Feller, Gramain & Weber [2005]), ou encore des
réflexions de Maurice Godelier ou de Louis Dumont (mobilisés par Iogna-Prat [1998, 2006]).<br>

Abstract: Ces réserves sont ponctuelles, en voici quelques exemples. Comme tout binôme, et il n'est pas
le seul dans le livre, le terme de contre-mémoire risque de produire l'impression d'opposition
mécanique ce qui n'est sûrement pas l'intention de l'auteure. Sur un autre registre, malgré tout
mon respect pour l'héritage intellectuel de Pierre Bourdieu, je ne suis pas convaincu par les efforts
de Christine Chivallon d'appliquer son appareil conceptuel à l'analyse du travail de la mémoire.
Puisque son érudition est très impressionnante, l'absence des travaux de Nathan Wachtel surprend
d'autant plus. L'Invention du quotidien de Michel de Certeau est citée, mais je n'ai trouvé aucune
mention de son concept opératoire de « propre », à mon avis très pertinent pour la démarche de
l'auteure. J'estime également que le concept de « lieu de mémoire » de Pierre Nora est trop rapidement
jugé inopérant pour sa recherche.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: In this article I examine Philip Qipa (P.Q.) Vundla’s Moral Rearmament-inspired (MRA) politics with a view to explicating the previously hidden currents at work in his political activism. In my analysis, I draw on the theoretical frameworks of Paul Ricoeur and Homi Bhabha. In terms of these conceptual foundations, I investigate Vundla’s involvement in two foundational events in the history of the South African struggle, namely the school boycott of 1955 and the bus boycott of 1957. The official history of these two events, written by social historians such as Tom Lodge, interprets them as the dawn of mass opposition against apartheid. However, I contend that a closer analysis of these two events via biographical material reveals a more complex history, implicitly connected to the person of P.Q. Vundla and his politics of negotiation and finding common ground between opposing ideologies. Vundla stands out within this context because he was a nonconforming ANC leader, who disagreed with the way the party leadership approached political activism. His approach was driven by MRA values, which sought political solutions through dialogue and aimed to benefit all communities within South Africa. Vundla can be seen as an early forerunner of the bridge-building politics of Nelson Mandela. It is hoped that, by examining the role of MRA values in Vundla’s activism, a fuller, more complex account of politics in the 1950s can be arrived at.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: The trial of Adolf Eichmann, in 1961, is generally considered a turning point in the history of Holocaust memory because it brought the Holocaust into the public sphere for the first time as a discrete event on an international scale. In the same year, Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin's film Chronicle of a Summer appeared in France. While absent from scholarship on memory of the Nazi genocide for over forty years, Chronicle of a Summer contains a scene of Holocaust testimony that suggests the need to look beyond the Eichmann trial for alternative articulations of public Holocaust remembrance. This essay considers the juxtaposition in Chronicle of a Summer of Holocaust memory and the history of decolonization in order to rethink the "unique" place that the Holocaust has come to hold in discourses on extreme violence. The essay argues that a discourse of truth and testimony arose in French resistance to the Algerian war that shaped and was shaped by memory of the Nazi genocide.<br>

Abstract: The continuing fallout from the theory wars, evident not least in the nostalgic after-theory narrative that is still in vogue, has dissipated critical energy in contemporary literary studies. Rejecting that narrative, this essay calls for a review of the legacy of theory and the polemical oppositions that set it against other scholarly enterprises, like book history. In particular, it suggests that the theoretical interrogation of the category of literature in the past forty years fruitfully intersects with book history's investigation of the material conditions of literary production, opening up new possibilities for literary historiography, while also imposing new demands on it. The essay identifies two traditions of antiessentialist thought (the skeptical and the enchanted), considers the ontology of the printed literary text, and examines the legacies of, among others, Jacques Derrida and Pierre Bourdieu.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Author(s): Oppenheim Lois<br>
Abstract: Beckett's "Three Dialogues with Georges Duthuit" poses two distinct difficulties for the reader: the revelation of artistic process or creative energy and the resistance to representation with its implication of objectification. The first may be defined in terms of a three-stage operation resulting in a depiction of sublimation or creative force. Without recourse to psychohistory, one may explore the second in terms of the paradoxical obsession with evocative memory evident throughout Beckett's work. Of this, a disturbance in object representation, understood in the psychoanalytic sense, may be the source.<br>

Abstract: This article briefly reviews the history and concept of ideology, largely as articulated by exponents of the Frankfurt School, and considers the impact that this has had on historical planning theory and practice, culminating in Habermasian derived communicative planning theory. It then considers the role of ideology in a post-Marxist world and argues for the value of Žižekian critique for understanding planning's contemporary role of ideologically defining the use of neoliberal space.<br>

Abstract: This article returns to research material initially gathered and used for an oral history project. Adopting a sociology of memory perspective, it analyses why and how the former internees at the annex camps of Drancy in Paris only rarely gave accounts of their internment to their families or in public. Following upon the work of Maurice Halbwachs, it studies the role of ties to groups and how they evolve over time in the expression of memories by the individuals concerned.<br>

Abstract: Dans cette perspective, toute pratique de lecture
peut être décrite comme un mouvement en trois temps :
«avant lire »/«lire »/«après lire». Des «intérêts
à la lecture » qui trouvent leur origine dans la situation
du lecteur - « avant lire » - incitent à un « faire » - « lire » -
qui porte à conséquences, immédiates ou différées
- «après lire» - et qui consolident en retour les «intérêts
à la lecture ». L'accent mis classiquement sur la seconde
phase (« lire ») - qui est aussi la plus difficilement
accessible à l'enquête - est alors déplacé sur les deux autres.<br>

Abstract: Through the experience of some ethnographic fields between France and Italy, Tuscany and the Alps, this paper reflects upon the potential of oral history and biography both as cognitive sources and as heritage assets contributing to the processes of improving the cultural values. In particular, we try to clarify the relationship between regional research projects, exhibitions and archiving processes of the sources of ethnographic research. This in relation to the development of new technologies including the web and to the social and cognitive potential use of oral sources in the capitalization and sharing of research materials with cultural communities and within their possible uses for the scientific community. What can become an anthropological interview once recorded, stored and catalogued? What is the potential of these audio recordings and their written versions within projects of participatory museography? How can the web offer new opportunities to those sources by including them in a global system of dialogue between archives? This view changes the responsibilities and possibilities of the researcher producer of sources and collector of voices, engaging him in a quite different consideration of his work to the benefit of societal projects.<br>

Abstract: Ricordo, a titolo di esempio, solo alcuni degli scrittori e degli studiosi che non
hanno avuto, per così dire, accesso alla rassegna (pur se implicitamente e continuamente
vivissimi all'attenzione di chi scrive) per l'impossibilità oggettiva di esibire lo sconfinato
universo delle presenze bibliche nella letteratura compresa tra il Duecento e il primo Ot-
tocento: il Dante delle opere 'minori', soprattutto della Vita Nuova (V. Branca, G. Gor-
ni), la predicazione medievale e moderna (C. Delcorno, R. Rusconi, L. Bolzoni, J. Berlioz,
etc.), le laude (G. Varanini, R. Bettarini, F. Mancini etc.), la sacra rappresentazione (M.
Martelli, N. Newbigin, F. Doglio, G. Ponte, F. Pezzarossa), il Boccaccio delle Rime e
delle Epistole (V. Branca, G. Auzzas) e di alcune parti del Decameron (P. Cherchi), la
produzione 'sacra' tassiana (Rime Sacre, Mondo Creato), l'Aretino (Larivaille) e il Folengo
(M. Chiesa, S. Gatti) nei panni di scrittori cristiani, l'Arcadia edificante, per riprendere
un titolo preciso del Di Biase, certa tragedia sacra settecentesca come quella di Martello
(I. Magnani, P. Trivero) e, soprattutto, l'Alfieri biblico del Saul e dell'Abele (A. Di Bene-
detto, E. Raimondi), lo Jacopo Ortis (M. A. Terzoli) e l'Ipercalisse del Foscolo (B. Rosada,
A. Forlini), il linguaggio poetico religioso del Porta (G. Pozzi) e del Belli, il Tommaseo
(M. Guglielminetti), il Pascoli (A. Traina, G. Goffis), D'Annunzio e molti altri ancora:
spesso, tra l'altro, privi di una vera e propria bibliografia «scritturale» a largo spettro,
se non di studi singoli, difficilmente annoverabili nell'ambito ristretto di una precisazione
doverosa, ma non esaustiva. Va detto anche che, sebbene la rassegna si chiuda con il
1995, qua e là è stato segnalato qualche libro del 1996, a cui si vuole ora aggiungere,
senza l'ambizione di averne citato tutti i volumi relativi all'oggetto delle precedenti pagi-
ne, A. Stauble, Le sirene eterne. Studi sull'eredità classica e biblica nella letteratura italia-
na, Ravenna, Longo, 1996; e E. Esposito, R. Manica, N. Longo, R. Scrivano, Memo-

Abstract: Temporal lobe epilepsy and certain personality disorders often result in experiences described as "religious." TLE research suggests a possible neurological basis for such experiences. Immediately the question arises about the authenticity of these experiences as religious. An experience is authentic if it furthers the authentic growth of the subject, regardless of what triggered it. So pathology may occasion authentic religious experiences, even as history exemplifies. For practical purposes, the further question about God in religious experience is secondary. The exception, miraculous occurrences, should not be granted without sufficient reason. This approach dissolves all conflict between science and faith.<br>

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Abstract: With the portrayal of local resentment towards the massive influx of Silesian refugees after WWII in the GDR in his novel Landnahme, Christoph Hein expands the literary representation of history he began earlier in Horns Ende, again using the fictional small town of Guldenberg as paradigmatic for the GDR, extended here over time to include unified Germany. Bernhard Haber's epic, but unscrupulous struggle to overcome the will of his neighbors for him to fail provides the backdrop for Hein's depiction of how the past unavoidably writes the future and how the collective process of socialization shapes meanings and values. Using five narrators, Hein applies his earlier concept of social autobiography to trace historical developments in the acquired collective attitudes of Germans towards Gypsies, Poles, the handicapped, and African and Vietnamese workers left behind after unification, all of whom were subjected to the same abusive language and discrimination directed at the refugees.<br>

Author(s): Boyd K. M.<br>
Abstract: Medical ethics, principles, persons, and perspectives is discussed under three headings: "History", "Theory", and "Practice". Under "Theory", the author will say something about some different approaches to the study and discussion of ethical issues in medicine–especially those based on principles, persons, or perspectives. Under "Practice", the author will discuss how one perspectives based approach, hermeneutics, might help in relation first to everyday ethical issues and then to public controversies. In that context some possible advantages of moving from controversy to conversation will be explored; and that will then be illustrated with reference to a current controversy about the use of human embryos in stem cell therapy research. The paper begins with history, and it begins in the author's home city of Edinburgh.<br>

Journal Title: Journal of Business Ethics<br>
Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27749757<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Bird Frederick<br>
Abstract: Typically people make ethical judgments with reference to unchanging principles, standards, rights, and values. This essay argues that such an ahistorical approach to ethics should be supplemented by a due regard for history. Invoking precedents by authors such as Jonsen and Toulmin, McIntyre, Niebuhr, Weber, De Tocqueville, Machiavelli and others, this essay explores several important ways in which a due regard for history can and should shape the practice of business ethics. Thus a due regard for history helps us both to cultivate fitting appreciation of cultural mores and to understand how current problems and issues have developed as they have; it helps us to gauge current responsibilities with respect legacies of problems inherited from the past; it helps us to develop a lively sense of what is possible in the present, given current contingencies and past experiences; and it moves us to rethink the practice of ethical auditing: not just as a backward-looking effort to gauge compliance but as a forward-looking way of learning from actual experiences and developing fitting responses.<br>

The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Si la Danse du Lion ne présente pas en soi un caractère religieux, les v ux
(offerts contre des dons en argent) sont proférés devant des autels, et prennent ainsi
un vague caractère de bénédiction. Ces autels installés dans les boutiques, sont le
plus souvent dédiés au Dieu du sol (ou « Maître des lieux ») mais aussi à d'autres divinités
dont les effigies sont promenées dans les défilés mis en place dans la Petite Asie au cours
des années 1990. Pour une description détaillée de la Danse du Lion, cf. Raulin, 2000,

Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Abstract: The appearance of diverse strands of post-processual archaeology resonates with the transformation of university structures, beginning in the 1970s, and gives voice to concerns that have been variously labelled post-structuralist, deconstructionist or critical theory. This article examines the resonance of the post-processual archaeologies with wider social and intellectual currents in the context of the ongoing confrontation with processual archaeology, attempts at a critical engagement with structuralism and symbolic anthropology, and rapprochement with history. It considers the implications of these perspectives.<br>

Abstract: Sociocultural anthropology and evolutionary biology have reached the point at which it is possible to give a coherent and synthetic account of the origins of human cultural variability. From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers some aspects of the early history of the American contribution to the International Biological Programme (IBP), ecology's only venture into 'Big Science'. It is argued that American ecologists were successful in obtaining generous funding for the IBP from the US Congress, thanks to a shared understanding of the way in which controlling nature was to be accomplished, expressed in the metaphor of the 'cybernetic machine'. To support this argument, a literary analysis is performed on Congressional documents, on scientific and popular books and papers by ecologists, and on writings of the environmental movement. The paper explores how a dominant representation of nature, or mentalité, is brought about, and its political effects.<br>

Abstract: Particular problems are posed in the study of lives since the course of life may be less continuous and predictable than sometimes assumed. Further, the most important aspect of developmental study may be the subjectively constructed narrative of development, or life history, which itself changes over personal and historical time. Following the interpretive approach pioneered by Dilthey, Weber, Freud, and, more recently, Ricoeur, Taylor, and others, lives may be considered as texts to be studied in a systematic manner. The concept of empathy as formulated within the clinical situation, and applied most recently to study of biography, may also foster understanding of changes over time in the life history.<br>

Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: After some initial remarks on the ongoing historiographic debates regarding experience as an analytical category, the article first tries to show, through a concise survey of J. G. Herder's essays on Ossian and Shakespeare, that Herder cannot be claimed as a source for the notion of historical experience in the sense of an immediate access to the past, as the theorist of history F. R. Ankersmit has stated. Instead, this article argues, experience can be understood as one of the key terms of Herder's historical view of modernity, whose development he describes as involving a paradigmatic change in the character of human experience itself. For Herder, the shift from primary to secondary experience in the modern historical process results in the necessity of an aestheticization of historiography. In this respect, the article briefly concludes, Herder inspired 19thcentury historians such as G. G. Gervinus.<br>

Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: Manipulations of time, ranging between moments and centuries, pervade Rogier van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece. They occur mainly among elements that have been considered forthright iconographic details or unremarkable scenery, including a cityscape, the star of the Magi, a figure among the Magi's followers, and a beggar. While several such temporal expressions find interpretive resonance in Scripture, patristic commentary, and sermons, their collaborative density in the altarpiece contrives a uniquely animated structure of meaning. Among unusual visual alignments that solicit exegetical attention from an observer, precisely charged relationships project backward and forward through history.<br>

Author(s): Zumbach Steven W.<br>
Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires fut déclenché par la publication d'un article érudit intitulé "The Intentional Fallacy," qui s'opposait à cette référence aux intentions des artistes et des auteurs dans la critique artistique et littéraire. Dans ce débat particulier, la difficulté de l'évaluation et de l'application de l'intention de l'artiste provenait de l'ambiguïté même du terme "intention." L'auteur examine 11 significations différnetes de ce mot, et il pose le problème de l'intention de l'artiste dans les contextes liés au domaine de la restauration. En outre, il présente des points de vue plus recénts, tirés des sciences sociales qui associent les problèmes de l'intention de l'artiste à celui de son rôle dans l'existence continue de l'oeuvre d'art. Les ouvrages des philosophes contemporains apportent des perspectives utiles sur la nature essentielle de l'art et de l'autonomie des oeuvres vis-à-vis de leurs créateurs. L'auteur pense que l'interprétation et l'étude des intentions de l'artiste est une tâche interdisciplinaire, et que son évaluation dans les contextes de la restauration doit être limitée à la considération des caractéristiques stylistiques particulières qui démontrent l'individualité corrélative des artistes et de leurs oeuvres. /// [Spanish] A mediados del siglo 20 fue hecha una afirmación formal acerca de que el objetivo de la conservación de arte es presentar la obra para que sea vista de acuerdo a la intención del artista. La disputa sobre esta afirmación entre conservadores e historiadores del arte comprendió diferencias de perspectiva sobre los roles relativos de la ciencia y la historia del arte en la interpretación de la intención del artista. Un debate entre filósofos, criticos de arte y críticos literarios, generado en forma independiente pero concurrente con esta disputa, fue encendido por la publicación de "La Falacia Internacional," un artóculo erudito que desacredita el recurso de apelar a las intenciones de los artistas y autores en las críticas del arte y la literatura. En este debate independiente, la dificultad en la evaluación y aplicación de la intención del artista fue adjudicada a la ambigüedad del término "intención." El autor discute 11 variaciones en el significado de este término, y coloca conjuntamente las cuestiones que rodean a la intención del artista dentro de los contextos de la conservación de arte. También presenta puntos de cista mas recientes en el campo de las ciencias sociales que asocian las cuestiones relativas a la intención del artista con el rol que éste tiene en la existencia perdurable de la obra de arte. Los escritos de filósofos contemporáneos contribuyen con perspectivas útiles acerca de la naturalcza esencial del arte y la autonomía de las obras de arte respecto de sus creadores. El autor encuentra que la interpretación y aplicación de la intención del artista es una tarea interdisciplinaria, y que su evaluación en contextos de conservacíon esta limitada a consideraciones sobre caractéristicas estilísticas distintivas, que demuestran la correlativa individualidad de los artistas y sus obras.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: Narratives of the Tibetan resistance army are not a part of national history in the Tibetan exile community. Drawing on stories by veterans of the resistance to the Chinese invasion and the explanations they give of its absence in Tibetan national history, I argue that this history has been "arrested" because of the challenges it poses to normative versions of history and community and, in turn, to internal and external representations of Tibet. This practice signifies the postponing of narrating certain histories until a time in the future when the dangers they pose to sustaining a unified Tibetan community in exile has receded. This practice of historical (un)production offers insight into temporality and subjectivity, plural identities in the face of national hegemony, and why history might be considered a combination of truth, fear, and lies.<br>

Abstract: Contemporary African American followers of Sunni Islam are self-consciously articulating a form of eating that they see as liberating them from the heritage of slavery, while also bringing them into conformity with Islamic notions of purity. In so doing, they participate in arguments about the meaning of "soul food," the relation between "Western" materialism and "Eastern" spirituality, and bodily health and its relation to mental liberation. Debates within the African American Muslim community show us how an older anthropological concern with food taboos can be opened up to history and to the experience of the past reinterpreted in terms of the struggles of the present.<br>

Abstract: The collection of essays under review is the most innovative attempt thus far to expain the decline of fertility in Europe. Of particular interest is the frequent mention of culture as a prominent factor in such explanations. The review suggests that while this collection is significant in higlighting its importance, bringing culture into population history may require a rethinking of the metanarratives and metaphors in which that history is cast.<br>

Abstract: Is history a category of reason, or is reason a category of history? These opposing questions have divided the structuralist from the materialist-but neither question is wrong. Analysis of the logic of oppositions challenges feminism, in particular, to find a logic-and a poetics-in which to render its values without historical or theoretical naiveté. I explore the question of the timing of feminism through Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray.<br>

Author(s): Zimra Michael F.<br>
Abstract: Assia Djebar's most recent text, "La femme sans sepulture," returns to the site of colonial history to represent the voice of resistance hero Zoulikha, a haunting figure of the author's own personal history represented only nominally in her corpus until now. Representing Zoulikha's return in Algeria as a spectral revisitation, Djebar's text examines both the potential and the vicissitudes of representing colonial violence and resistance through the spectral domain and thus engages critically with tendencies of postcolonial theory to promote haunting as a mode of historical reinscription. Djebar's text explores how haunting relates to cultural and postcolonial memory through an investigation of the issues surrounding the inscription of Zoulikha's story of resistance and torture within the colonial context, and thereby queries the relation between the haunting memories of colonial violence and contemporary civil warfare in Algeria. This article explores, in particular, how Djebar's work engages critically with the spectral aura that haunts both postcolonial place and theory.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that the construction of the 18th and 19th century British rhetorical theories and canon was strongly influenced by the debates between Catholic (or Anglo-Catholic) traditionalists and Protestant critics over religious hermeneutics, by examining three specific cases, the Phalaris controversy, definitions of the enthymeme, and the reception history of the Rhetorica ad Alexandrum. The major figures discussed are Richard Bentley, William Temple, John Gillies, Edward Copleston, Sydney Smith, Richard Whately, James Hessey, and William Hamilton.<br>

Author(s): Milbank John<br>
Abstract: Salvation is neither "individual" nor "social" but concerns insertion into an ecclesial narrative. This conclusion invites a series of metanarrative considerations by which, in turn, the "narrative ecclesiology" of Henri de Lubac is shown to be too apolitical in comparison with that of Augustine, Augustine's too resigned to the permanence of two cities compared with that of Hegel, and He- gel's too suppressive of the salvific viability of a non-coercive order compared with that of PierreSimon Ballanche. In a corrected form, Augustine's philoso- phy of history outlines the basic narrative conditions for salvation, and this, rather than the metanarratives of enlightenment, gives the true possibility of social critique.<br>

Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Abstract: J. Robert Oppenheimer was among the most important and enigmatic figures in 20th century science. He is best known for successfully directing the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bombs that were dropped on Japan at the end of World War II. Subsequently, he became a scientist and statesman who advised the United States government in the areas of atomic weapons development and public policy. He later became subject to an investigation in 1954 into his previous political affiliations and his personal behavior that ended in the revoking of his security clearance. This essay seeks to chronicle Oppenheimer's coming of age as a public intellectual with a view toward his own psychological history and most especially in relationship to the stages of faith development articulated by James Fowler and colleagues. Moreover, though not conventionally religious, Oppenheimer's life and thought were permeated with themes and ideas of a religious and ethical nature that shaped his adult character and informed his view of the world. This essay was originally presented at The Richardson History of Psychiatry Research Seminar at Weill Cornell Medical College.<br>

Abstract: The role of narrative in explanation has received considerable attention in most of the disciplines concerned with questions of historical process, including history, geology, psychoanalysis and palaeo-anthropology. Archaeologists, however, have been curiously reluctant to consider the proposition that their reconstructions of the past are fundamentally narrative in character. An argument is put forward for the serious study of narrative in archaeology, and three case studies from the prehistory of the New Guinea Highlands are presented in support: a brief review of the debate over the impact of sweet potato on Highland society; an analysis of the changing interpretations of the Kuk Swamp agricultural site by Jack Golson; and a summary of the role of indigenous narratives in accounting for the history of wetland drainage amongst Huli speakers in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea.<br>

Abstract: Analysis of the Turkish state in the 20th century both draws upon and supports Gramsci's definition of the state as "dictatorship + hegemony." Both the form of the capitalist state and its activities rest upon the hegemony of the dominant class. The importance of society and class conflicts in understanding the capitalist state suggests a critical position vis-à-vis the state autonomy tradition. The history of the Turkish state provides support for the argument that the dominant class must have established hegemony in the state in the first place, since without this there is no guarantee of successful use of the coercive power of the state on behalf of the sectional interests of the dominant class.<br>

Abstract: This article constitutes an exploration of Mahmud Darwish's poem, "The Hoopoe," as part of a study on the relationship of myths to culture, in general, and to literature and poetry, in particular. It starts from the hoopoe as a mythical symbol pulling the text in two directions. First, a direction that relates the poem, through time, to the realms of the universe, dream, and poetry, using the language of insinuations and allusions; second, a fictional direction that makes of the the poem-through evocation of previous quest journeys, including texts by Al-Jahiz, Avicenna, Al-Suhrawardi, Al-Hallaj, Aristophanes, and Farid Al-Din Attar-a quest into the depths of the individual and the collective self. Memory, history, and language, culminate in the discovery of the mother-land. Thus, Darwish's poem may be classified as poetry, prose, drama, and epic. It is, in fact, a mixture of all these genres, as well as a literary myth narrating the story of the search for a sacred time-the time of beginnings, and of childhood. /تمثل المقالة حفراﹰ استبطانياﹰ في قصيدة "الهدهد" لمحمود درويش - ضمن بحث في علاقة الأساطير بالثقافة عامة وبالأدب والشعر خاصة - انطلاقاﹰ من الهدهد كرمز أسطوري يتجاذب النص في اتجاهين اثنين: أ- اتجاه جدولي، يصل القصيدة - عبر الزمن - بعالم الكون وعالم المنام وعالم الشعر في لغة اللمح والإشارة٠ ب- اتجاه أفقي قصصي، يجعل من القصيدة - عبر رحلات نموذجية سابقة ومن خلال نصوص حاضرة غائبة للجاحظ، وابن سينا، والسهروردي، والحلاج، وأرسطوفان، وفريد الدين العطار، وغيرهم - رحلة في أعماق الذات الفردية، وفي أعماق الذات الجماعية ذاكرة وتاريخاﹰ٠ تجمع قصيدة درويش بين "الشعر" و"النثر" والمسرحية والملحمة، كما أنها أسطورة أدبية تقص علينا قصة بحث عن زمن مقدس هو زمن البدايات والطفولة٠‬<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

Abstract: L'auteur tente dans ce texte d'éclaircir certains aspects de l'imaginaire en relation avec l'Etat, la politique, mais aussi avec la violence et le mal, dans un contexte où la dialectique de l'identité et de l'altérité reste l'une des structures de l'imaginaire. L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles.

El contexto es de redimensionamiento del tiempo práctico, de los desplazamientos y de las relaciones entre lo local y lo global. En estos tiempos de interculturalidad, la comunicación juega un rol muy importante; no tanto en su dimensión mediática tecnológica, sino en especial en las dinámicas de mediaciones culturales que se desdoblan de las relaciones mediatizadas. Este trabajo pretende reflexionar sobre las transformaciones de los procesos comunicacionales en la contemporaneidad, marcados por fuertes movimientos de hibridación, así como pensar la interculturalidad en el contexto de las mediaciones culturales, a partir de autores latinoamericanos en diálogo con autores franceses. También, a partir de material de los medios, se presentarán ilustraciones del escenario cultural brasileño, que está marcado por una larga historia de hibridación, llena de dinámicas interculturales. We live in a context of borders that are dissolving in many senses, of the convergence and hybridisation of technologies, mass media and cultures. The context is the resizing of practical time, of movements and links between the local and the global. In these times of interculturality, communication plays a very important role; not so much in its technological media dimension, but particularly in the dynamics of cultural mediations that are dividing off from mediatised relations. This article aims to reflect on the transformations in present-day communication processes, marked by strong movements of hybridisation, as well as examining how to consider interculturality in the context of cultural mediations, based on dialogue between Latin American and French authors. Also, using media material, the article presents illustrations of the Brazilian cultural scene, which is marked by a long history of hybridisation that is filled with intercultural dynamics.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the text of an inaugural lecture given as Professor of Modern History in the University of Oxford on 7 November 2008. It arises from a research project entitled Around 1968: Activism, Networks, Trajectories', which involves a team of historians examining samples of activist networks in fourteen European countries, in order to understand ways of becoming an activist, being an activist and making sense of activism. The key terms of this project are transnationalism – tracing resonances and interactions between activists and activist networks across frontiers – and subjectivity – using oral testimony to understand the phenomenon of activism. The framing and presentation of the project incited a rethink of the methods of oral history, not least because the project originated in Oxford, where scepticism persists about the credibility of oral history as a discipline. To persuade this audience of the power of oral history, the approach was taken to locate it at the confluence of three recent developments which have impacted on the study of history as a whole: the linguistic turn, memory studies, and interest in subjectivity, intersubjectivity and the unconscious. These reflections are then used to illuminate evidence drawn from French activists interviewed in the course of 2007 and 2008.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: The historical development of theories regarding the later prehistory of the Southeast illustrates the manner in which families of theoretical models come to form the cognitive capital of working archaeologists. Tradationally, however, Southeasternists have largely preferred to ignore overt debates over theory and method. Moreover, as a group they have shown little inclination to indulge in the rampant and fruitless forms of archaeological relativism that are emerging at present.<br>

Abstract: The history of literary studies is especially important today as Germanistik takes account of its institutionalization in the university and redefines its disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing the two best-known reform universities, Berlin in 1809/10 and Constance in 1966/67, I show their strikingly similar commitments to notions of scholarship/research, learning, and pedagogy. That these common concerns are based on the influence of hermeneutics is not surprising; the philosophy of Bildung and Wissenschaft central to educational theory for Humboldt in Berlin, as well as for Jauß's and Iser's Rezeptionsästhetik in Constance, is metacritical and encourages reflection on understanding and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science approach points back to a reflexive or self-referring awareness that locates the individual in his time and place. Some other aspects may also lead us to a critical approach to history : Kant's reflective orientational model of the human community, the limits he places on authentic interpretation, Heidegger's views on authentic historicity, and Dilthey's analysis of systems of reciprocal influence seen as a framework for Ricœur's conception of singular causal imputation.<br>

Abstract: La sociabilité méridionale offre l'occasion d'un débat pluri-transdisciplinaire dont l'auteur, à la suite des historiens et des ethnologues, a tenté d'établir une typologie. Il s'agira d'approfondir la dimension politique dont certains cercles de villages font preuve, tant par leur action au sein d'une démocratie participative que par un ensemble de pratiques recourant à la notion de légitimité. Parmi ces mécanismes de contre-pouvoir, le patrimoine politique dont le cercle est le symbole recouvre la notion d'un imaginaire qui trouve à la fois ses sources dans l'histoire locale et dans la mémoire nationale. The southern sociability offers the opportunity of a pluri-transdisciplinary debate of which the author, following historians and ethnologists, tried to establish a typology. The purpose here is to better define the political dimension of some village circles revealed both through their action within a participative democracy and a set of practices appealing to the notion of legitimacy. Among these counterpower mechanisms the political heritage symbolised by the circle covers the notion of imagination rooted both in the local history and the national memory. Die südfranzösische Geselligkeit bietet die Gelegenheit einer inter- und transdisziplinären Debatte. Der Autor hat versucht, deren Typologie zu erstellen, dabei Historikern und Ethnologen folgend. Es handelt sich hier darum, die politische Dimension näher zu bestimmen, die einige Dorfkreise durch ihre Tätigkeit innerhalb einer partizipativen Demokratie sowie durch eine Gesamtheit von Praktiken aufzeigen, die den Begriff der Legitimität in Anspruch nehmen. Unter diesen Gegenkraftsmechanismen umfasst das durch den Kreis symbolisierte politische Erbe den Begriff der Vorstellungswelt, die in der lokalen Geschichte und dem nationalen Gedächtnis gewurzelt ist.<br>

Abstract: En janvier 2003, le Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie ferme ses portes. Ses collections sont transférées au quai Branly, en vue de l'ouverture d'un musée des arts et civilisations d'Afrique, d'Asie, d'Océanie et des Amériques. Différentes campagnes d'enquêtes, réalisées depuis 2000, rendent intelligible ce nouvel épisode de l'histoire mouvementée du palais de la porte Dorée. A partir du triple point de vue de l'institution muséale, du personnel et du public, ces enquêtes éclairent le processus de la fermeture d'un musée « patrimoine national » et de son nouveau destin. La réflexion porte plus précisément sur les liens apparemment contradictoires entre rupture et continuité, clôture et pérennité, pesanteurs du passé et évolution du regard. La création prochaine d'une Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration peut illustrer ces paradoxes. The National Museum of African and Oceanian Arts closed in January 2003. Its collections were transferred to the future Quai Branly Museum of Arts and civilizations from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Various survey campaigns carried out since the year 2000 explain this new episode of the eventful history of the Palais at the Porte Dorée. From the threefold point of view of the museum institution, the personnel and the visitors these surveys throw some light on the closure process of a museum belonging to the national patrimony and on its new destiny. The study is focussed on the seemingly contradictory relations between rupture and continuity, closure and durability, heaviness of the past and new look at museums. The future creation of a national city of the history of immigration illustrates these paradoxes. Das nationale Museum der Afrikanischen und Ozeanischen Künste wurde im Januar 2003 geschlossen. Seine Sammlungen wurden in dem zukünftigen Museum der Künste und Zivilizationen aus Afrika, Asia, Okeania und die Amerikas am Quai Branly gebracht.Verschiedene Erhebungen, die seit 2000 durchgeführt wurden, zeigen die Bedeutung dieser neuen Episode der bewegten Geschichte des Palasts Porte Dorée. Aus dem dreifachem Gesichtspunkt der musealen Institution, des Personals und des Publikums ermöglichen diese Erhebungen, die Schliessung eines dem nationalen Erbe gehörenden Museums und sein neues Schicksal zu verstehen. Die Studie konzentriert sich auf die anscheinend widersprüchliche Verbindungen zwischen Bruch und Kontinuität, Schliessung und Fortdauer, Schwerfälligkeit der Vergangenheit und neuem Blick auf die Museen. Die baldige Schöpfung eines internationalen Zentrums der Geschichte der Einwanderung illustriert diese Paradoxe.<br>

Abstract: Partant du constat que les faits sociaux de mémoire sont portés par des actes de communication, il s'agit ici de dégager les pratiques qui alimentent les formes de « l'agir » socio-mémoriel, aujourd'hui présent en France et ailleurs. Quels processus sont a l'œuvre dans des situations post-génocidaires, souvent aussi post-migratoires, comme dans la Shoah (« Khurbn » en yiddish) par exemple ? Dans le cas d'Ashkénazes, il s'agit d'une reinscription qualitative au sein des cartographies de la parenté, mais aussi d'une reconnexion avec des périodes antérieures au genocide et à l'ethnocide à travers des événements culturels. Since the work of memory cannot exist without inter-subjective exchanges, this paper introduces in the study of memory the concept of « social acting » created by Weber. Attempting to point out the plurality of the practices that feed the various forms of socio-memorial movements present today in France and elsewhere. Which are the processes taking on a very particular aspect in post-genocidal as in post-migratory situations such as after the Shoah (Khurbn in Yiddish) ? In the case of the Ashkenase, these processes are also post-ethnocide and consist in a qualitative re-inscription within genealogical mapping and simultaneously in the long development of a history in which the genocide constitutes a memorial screen as well as actions of re-inscribing and re-connecting with cultural markers associated to periods antedating the genocide and ethnocide. Da Erinnerungsarbeit nicht ohne das Betrachten von zwischenmenschlichem Austausch und sozialer Praxis erfolgen kann, soll im Rahmen dieses Artikels das Webersche Konzept des « Sozialen Handelns » in die Untersuchung von Erinnerungen einbezogen werden. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass soziale Erinnerungen durch Kommunikation ausgedrückt werden, möchte dieser Artikel die Vielfalt der Praktiken zeigen, die heute in Frankreich und anderswo die Vielzahl der gesellschaftlichen Erinnerungsbewegungen prägen. Die Erinnerungsprozesse verdeutlichen vor allem die soziale und zeitliche Beziehung zum Anderen. Besonders interessant zu analysieren ist sind Post-Shoah-(Khurbn auf Jiddisch) und Post-Auswanderungs-Erinnerungenen. In diesem Artikel richtet sich das Augenmerk vor allem auf Ashkenasische Juden aus Deutschland, Zentral-und Osteuropa, deren Situation nach dem Ethnozid betrachtet wird. Dabei ist eine qualitative Wiederaufnahme der Lebenspraxis der Elterngeneration zu beobachten ; ebenso wie ein Anknüpfen im Rahmen bestimmter kultureller Riten an die Zeit vor dem Völkermord.<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de l'histoire de la psychologie, la revolution cognitive n'a pas cessé de progresser. Celle qui a cours aujourd'hui cherche à expliquer comment les individus parviennent a donner des significations au monde complexe qui les entoure : il est temps à présent de comprendre différents modes d'élaboration du sens. Quatre modes distincts sont suggérés. Le premier, le mode intersubjectif, concerne l'établissement, le façonnement et le maintien de l'intersubjectivité. Le deuxième, le mode actionnel, concerne l'organisation de l'action. Le troisième, le mode normatif, intègre les éléments particuliers dans des contextes normatifs et s'exprime en imposant des contraintes aux deux premiers modes. Les trois modes ont en commun d'être fortement dépendants du contexte: Les narratifs — ou les récits — sont l'instrument par excellence permettant d'ancrer les trois premiers modes d'élaboration du sens dans un ensemble plus structuré. On peut supposer que le quatrième mode d'élaboration du sens, le mode propositionnel, vise à décontextualiser les trois modes précédents en les soumettant à la vérification et aux justifications logiques. Throughout the entire history of cognitive psychology, a cognitive revolution has always been in progress. The current cognitive revolution began to explain how individuals come to make meaning out of a complex world ; it now needs to turn more vigorously to different forms of meaning making. Four modes are suggested. The first one is directed to the establishment, shaping and maintenance of intersubjectivity. A second form, the actional mode, is concerned with the way action is organized. The third form, the normative mode, construes particulars in normative contexts ; it expresses itself by imposing constraints on the first two modes. These three modes of meaning making have in common to be context dependent. Narratives or stories are the vehicles par excellence for entrenching the first three modes into a more structured whole. It is suggested that the fourth mode of meaning making, the propositional mode, is directed to the decontextualization of the preceeding three modes by imposing verifiability and logical justification. A brief account of how this set of meaning making processes might have grown out of human evolution is discussed. In conclusion : no reductionist theory on mind will do it proper justice.<br>

Abstract: Que ce soit à l'IUFM ou à l'Université en Sciences de l'Éducation, les enseignants sont de plus en plus confrontés à la diversité des expériences des parcours de formation des étudiants à qui ils s'adressent. Cette pluralité n'impose-t-elle pas un changement des pratiques de formation et notamment le développement, dans les groupes de travail, d'une communication favorisant la symbiose des divers apports culturels de ces étudiants ? L'utilisation des biographies ou des histoires de vie en formation ne peut-elle pas permettre d'instrumenter ce travail et notamment faciliter la prise en compte des itinéraires individuels de formation ? The students are more specifically invited to meditate on the development of their curriculum. The building of their formative biography creates the mental space that is needed to question the ideas and notions which will allow them to use biography as an instrument to identify the mental representations as well as the events and situations of their life from which the individual, collective, social and cultural dimensions of their activities emerged. In this sense, this research and training shows that formative life history can allow us to distance ourselves from a priori assumptions, as well as introduce students to different methods of research.<br>

Abstract: L'idée de laïcité n'est pas soustraite à l'histoire. C'est pourquoi il est illusoire de postuler son sens dans l'absolu. Aujourd'hui, comme en d'autres époques, sa valeur politique tend à se polariser sur une opposition binaire entre une acception libérale et une acception anti-libérale dite républicaine. Toutefois, trois traits semblent particuliers aux années 1990 : — une disjonction entre l'acception politique dominante de la laïcité et sa force juridique, gagée par la Constitution et cadrée par des instruments juridiques internationaux ; — l'orientation nationalitaire du débat, pointant vers les populations issues de l'immigration musulmane, et questionnant leur appartenance à la nation ; — enfin, l'inscription du débat dans la problématique globale de la modernisation des formes scolaires, laquelle véhicule à la fois une epistemologie constructiviste et interactionniste, et une éthique laïque ef libérale. Les « affaires de foulards » sont un analyseur de cette complexité. Secularity concept must not be taken away from history. So it would be illusory to think about it as an abstract notion. Presently, as in older times, its political value tends to be focusing on a binary opposition between a liberal notion and an anti-liberal, so-called republican one. However three characteristics are specific of the nineties : — the split between main political meaning of secularity and its strength in legal terms, provided by the Constitution and by international legal tools ; — a debate focusing on nationality issues, with questions related to national belonging or muslim immigrants ; — last, the integration of this debate into the global issue of school modernization, which is concerned with a constructivist and interactionist epistemology and a liberal, secular ethic, as well. « Headscarves cases » are an indicator of this complexity.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y reivindicaciones que recientemente han sido avivados por los usos públicos y políticos de la historia y de la memoria. La historia escolar admite la historia pero no las memorias como saber de referencia legítimo; sin embargo las conmemoraciones y el "deber de memoria" se invitan cada vez más frecuentemente. Tales evoluciones interrogan los componentes de la asignatura escolar: las finalidades identitarias y cívicas, los contenidos y sus renovaciones, las prácticas, desigualmente conocidas en este campo, y finalmente los aprendizajes a menudo más esperados que comprobados. Das Verhältnis zwischen Geschichte und Gedächtnis in der Schule ist komplex und mehrdeutig. Es gibt den Anlass zu Debatten und Forderungen, die die öffentlichen und politischen Anwendungen des Gedächtnisses und der Geschichte neulich haben aufleben Tassen. Die Schulgeschichte duldet die Geschichte aber nicht die Erinnerungen als Maßstab gebendes Wissen, während Gedenkfeier und "Erinnerungsgebot'' (Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit) immer öfter daran teilhaben. Eine solche Entwicklung stellt die Komponenten des Schulfachs Geschichte in Frage: über seine Zwecke, was die Identitätsfrage und den Bürgersinn betrifft, über den Inhalt und seine Veränderungen, über Praktiken, die in diesem Gebiet oft ungenügend bekannt sind, und schließlich über das tatsächliche Erlernen, das oft eher erhofft als erwiesen ist.<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity of the subject taught. School history holds a special position in didactics due to the complexity of its references (scholarly production, self referencing and public use of history). Set in between passing consensual knowledge on and seeking a critical position, school history objects are still under new questioning that changes with social demands as recent debates on actual competing questions related to memory show it. Therefore school history seems to be a blend of social representations, private knowledge and proven knowledge. For fifteen years, works have enabled us to better define "historical thinking" and the specific cognitive processes that are involved in class (historical time, conceptualization, problematization, construction of explanatory schemes). Conceptualized research have allowed to explore real professional practices and model their "normal" functioning: a subject that favours passing on knowledge telling the truth about the past and being attached to using neutral documents; a subject that has difficulty to coherently link ambitious intellectual purposes (preparing active citizens for tomorrow's world) to class activities often limited to memorizing, recognizing and sorting. That is why we can see a problematic develop which is centered on the difference between intentions and practices. Connecting the notion of adherence to the rules of the "didactical contract" to the other theoretical models of human sciences developed within the research team., the work -done in a still too unfocused way -reveals some important acquired knowledge which could be taken into account in teacher training programmes. Esta nota subraya la especificidad de la disciplina enseñada. La historia escolar ocupa una posición original en el campo de las didácticas por la complejidad de sus referencias (producción sabia, autorreferencia escolar y usos públicos de la historia). Divididos entre una transmisión de conocimientos consensúales y la búsqueda de una postura crítica, los objetos de historia enseñados permanecen sometidos a interrogaciones repetidas a merced de la petición social como lo muestran los debates recientes en torno a las cuestiones relativas a las memorias vivas y competidoras. La historia enseñada aparece así como una mezcla que articula representaciones sociales, saberes privados y conocimientos validados. Desde hace unos quince años, ciertos trabajos permitieron delimitar mejor el "pensar en historia" y los procesos cognoscitivos específicos en juego en la clase (tiempo histórico, conceptualización, problematización, construcción de esquemas explicativos). Investigaciones contextualizadas han permitido explorar las prácticas profesionales efectivas y modelizar su funcionamiento "normal": una disciplina que privilegia la transmisión de saberes que dicen la realidad del pasado y apegada a la neutralidad del texto enseñado; una disciplina a la que le cuesta poner en coherencia finalidades intelectuales ambiciosas (preparar al ciudadano activo en la ciudad de mañana) y actividades en la clase a menudo limitadas a la memorización, la localización y la categorización. Por eso se ve dibujarse en los trabajos actuales, una problemática centrada en las diferencias entre las intenciones y las prácticas. Articulando la noción de sumisión a las reglas del "contrato didáctico" con los otros modelos teóricos de las SHS movilizadas en el seno de los equipos de investigación, los trabajos llevados de manera todavía demasiado dispersada dejan aparecer experiencias ¡mportantes que podrían tomarse en consideración en la formación de los docentes. Dieser Bericht unterstreicht die Besonderheit des Schulfachs Geschichte. Geschichte in der Schule hat eine originale Stellung im Feld der Didaktik wegen der Komplexität ihrer Referenzen (wissenschaftliche Schriften, Referenz für sich selbst in der Schule und öffentliche Benutzung der Geschichte). Zwischen der Verbreitung konsesueller Kenntnisse und der Suche nach einer kritischen Haltung hin-und hergerissen, sind die Lehrinhalte in Geschichte nach wie vor je nach sozialer Anfrage einer ständigen Fragestellung ausgesetzt, wie neulich die Debatten um lebhafte und entgegengesetzte Gedächtnisfragen. Die Geschichte als Schulfach erscheint also als eine Mischung zwischen sozialen Vorstellungen, privatem Wissen und bewährten Kenntnissen. Seit etwa 15 Jahren haben einige Arbeiten es ermöglicht, das „Denken in Geschichte” und die kognitiven Prozesse besser einzuschätzen, die in der Schule auf dem Spiel stehen (historische Zeit, Konzeptualisierung, Problematisierung, Bildung erklärender Schemata). Kontextualisierte Forschungsarbeiten haben es erlaubt, die tatsächlichen Berufspraktiken zu erforschen und „normalen” Betrieb zu modellieren: ein Schulfach, das die Übertragung von Kenntnissen, die die Realität der Vergangenheit beschreibt und großen Wert auf die Neutralität des unterrichteten Textes legt; ein Fach, das sich Mühe gibt, ehrgeizige intellektuelle Zwecke (den aktiven Bürger in der Stadt von morgen mit Werkzeugen bewaffnen) mit Aktivitäten in der Klasse in Kohärenz zu bringen, die sich oft auf Memorisierung, Markierung und Kategorisierung begrenzen. Auf diese Weise kann man in den heutigen Arbeiten beobachten, wie eine Problematik auftaucht, im Mittelpunkt derer die Diskrepanz zwischen Absichten und Praktiken steht. In dem man den Begriff der Unterwerfung zu den Regeln des „didaktischen Vertrags” mit den anderen theoretischen Modellen (in den Sozial-und Geschichtswissenschaften) kombiniert, die in den Forschungsteams benutzt werden, lassen die bisher auf noch zu verstreute Weise geführten Arbeiten wichtige Erwerbungen erkennen, die in der Lehrerausbildung berücksichtigt werden könnten.<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Author(s): VarineAbstract: This ethnographic study of the creation of a museum in Le Creusot (France) provides an analysis of the heritage industry that emerged in the wake of the demise of a family company around which the town was built. This museum was a reaction to the passing of an age when industrial and urban environments were intrinsically linked. Through this description of how the past is collected and recollected in a museum, this article attempts to determine if this duty of remembrance is not, to a certain extent, a strategy of forgetfulness. Is cultural regeneration-the staging of history fading into oblivion-our society's sole response to industrial regeneration?<br>

Abstract: This article examines social memories in France over the last 10 years. There has been a significant amount of 'memory work' during this period, concerning various aspects of French history, including the World Wars, but predominantly postcolonial issues: the Algerian War, the legacy of slavery, memories of Empire and memories of Immigration in particular. The 'devoir de mémoire' (duty to remember) and 'work of memory' (Paul Ricœur) have taken on greater, and controversial, proportions. While President Jacques Chirac was for some the 'président du devoir de mémoire' (President who championed the duty to remember), President Nicolas Sarkozy seems intent on ending what he sees as the trend towards 'repentance'. After a discussion of the wider memory culture in France, this article focuses on collective and social memories of the Franco-Algerian War (1954-62) Through an analysis of various 'vectors of memory' (Henry Rousso) it argues that the recent upsurge in 'memory work' in France is very much anchored in the present postcolonial social context in France. That memory work is however largely symbolic and in some ways unsatisfactory. It shows that much of the recent work of memory has been only belatedly and partially undertaken by the State, and with civil society in some ways yet to follow.<br>

Abstract: El autor reflexiona sobre la evolución de la historia del discurso en Francia y su aproximación a la historia semántica, inspirada en la obra de Koselleck, y a la historia del discurso de tradición anglosajona. Tras repasar los antecedentes de la actual historia del discurso francesa desde los años setenta y evaluar la influencia de la obra de Foucault en esta disciplina, el autor aborda, a la luz de los últimos trabajos de Quentin Skinner, la cuestión de la intencionalidad individual y colectiva de los textos históricos, es decir, los mecanismos que constituyen y explican, en palabras de Koselleck, «la conexión empírica entre la realidad y el discurso». The author thinks about the evolution of the history of discourse in France and its approach to semantic history as inspired by the work of Koselleck, and also to the history of discourse in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. After revising the precedents of the current French history of speech from the 70s and evaluating the influence of the work of Foucault in this discipline, the author approaches, in the light of Quentin Skinner's last works, the question of the individual and collective premeditation of historical texts, that is to say, the mechanisms that constitute and explain, in words of Koselleck, «the empirical connection between reality and discourse».<br>

Author(s): Jameson Fredric<br>
Abstract: This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics, the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in. The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of historical writing.<br>

Author(s): White Amélia P.<br>
Abstract: A análise da construção de figuras femininas como Leonor Teles e Filipa de Lencastre nas crónicas de Fernão Lopes, requer uma metodologia metahistórica como a proposta por Hayden White em Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe e The Content of the Form. Só assim é possível encontrar o comentário social, cultural, político e até histórico aí subjacente. Os quatro "modes of emplotment" e "explanation by emplotment" propostos por White revelam que a narrativa da estória de Leonor está estruturada como tragédia enquanto que a de Filipa é típica de romance medieval. A mensagem histórico-política entretecida por Lopes nas estórias destas rainhas aponta para a responsabilidade de Leonor em causar a queda da primeira dinastia portuguesa, enquanto Filipa é louvada como mãe de uma nova dinastia abrindo uma era de paz e prosperidade. O objectivo último do cronista é justificar a aclamação problemática de D. João I.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo propõe uma interpretação do fenômeno Chico Xavier na cultura e na sociedade brasileira. A partir do reconhecimento da importância cruciai de seu modelo mítico de espírita exemplar, o lugar de absolute destaque ocupado pelo médium mineiro na história do kardecismo brasileiro será interpretado à luz de urn código cultural articulado em sua biografia, que busca sintetizar os personagens paradigmáticos do "santo" e do "caxias". Desdobrado na unidade de sua obra mediúnica e trajetória pública, o tipo de espiritismo construído em Chico Xavier evidencia a proposta kardecista dominante ao longo do século XX, enquanto modelo de cidadania, prática religiosa e projeto nacional. The present article is a reading of the place of the phenomenon Chico Xavier in the Brazilian culture and society. Starting from the recognition of his crucial importance as a mythical model of exemplary spiritualist, the absolute prominence of the medium in the history of the Brazilian spiritualism will be interpreted in the light of a cultural code articulated in his biography, that synthesizes the Brazilian mythical characters of the "saint" and of the "caxias". Unfolded from his life and works the model of spiritualism built by Chico Xavier evidences the kardecismo's dominant religious point of view along the 20th Century, while citizenship model, religious practice and national project.<br>

Abstract: This study employs hermeneutics to illuminate a musical life history. I Made Lebah was a unique individual who lived during a violent and creative time of Bali's history. This paper explores his life through the lens of hermeneutics and identifies music stages through segmented, progressive hermeneutical arcs within his lifelong arc of experience. A consciousness of historical situatedness and an enabling appropriation allowed him to master a number of Balinese music styles and assume the title, "great teacher." The people he worked with, including composers Lotring and Colin McPhee and his lifelong friend, Agung Mandra, all affected him and helped him to acquire a self-awareness, a rapid learning and internalization process, and a sensitivity to reflective hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Although ZhangTaiyan is famous for being a late Qing nationalist and revolutionary, scholars have yet to explore fully the significance of his Buddhist writings, especially as they relate to time and history. This article closely examines Zhang's writings about time and history and points out that Zhang made two interrelated but potentially conflicting arguments. On the one hand, he invoked Yogācāra Buddhism and Zhuang Zi to expound a relativistic vision of time and history. From this perspective, each nation has its historical particularity and cannot be judged from an external standard. However, on the other hand, in a context where intellectuals were uncritically adopting a framework of history as progress, Zhang grounded the theory of evolution in a theory of karmic seeds to develop an interpretation of history as a double movement in which the good gets better and the bad gets worse. The article delves into the significance of Zhang's arguments by highlighting the symmetries between Zhang's exposition of history and the logic of capitalism. Such structural similarities suggest that Zhang could think about time and history in this way precisely because he inhabited a world mediated by the dynamic of capitalism. His writings on Zhuang Zi and Buddhism should be seen as an example of a resistance to capitalism that is not based on a narrative of progress. In the context of twentieth-century Chinese intellectual history, where narratives of progress and evolution are a dominant chord, Zhang's counterpunctual critique of evolution is especially inspiring.<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents a history of the large group approach in relation to Foulkesian group analytic psychotherapy, including the nature of this approach in relation to Foulkesian principles. Much of the theory reflects Foulkes's attitude, but there are also clear distinctions made, notably a new stance in our thinking about groups as a result of the increase in size (i.e., a membership of about 20), the introduction of the cultural dimension which this increase entails, and the question of what happens after the resolution of Kleinian, oedipal and familial conflicts has been achieved in psychoanalysis and small groups, notably what happens once "exile" has been achieved. The approach presented proposes to handle the frustration and hate that these conflicts engender in the form of negative or antilibidinal energies, and their transformation into psychic energy, through dialogue leading from hate to the establishment of koinonia, or impersonal fellowship, and of microcultural influences which promote rather than inhibit communication. Being neither small nor large, a group of about 20 members has become known as a "median" group.<br>

Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I partake in a self-inventory to textually narrate for you as well as myself the relationship, as I experience it, between stories and theories in my intellectual life. My autobiographical reflections span the period of the 1947 partition in Indian history, as experienced by my family, to my own journey as a scholar. I tell you, in personal narrative and essay form, a family story of resistance to "refugee narratives" as a story of inherited displacements that interrogates the ontology of my intellectual leanings, by showing the various limens (see Turner's The Anthropology of Performance) that I continue to encounter in my struggles to story. In doing so, I articulate my resistance to theory, my leanings toward storying, and the ongoing struggle to reside in the liminal space between stories and theories. I show myself caught in intellectual limens. While I do not propose any way out of them, I believe that explorations such as these are necessary for scholars to reflect, interrogate, and embody to honestly pursue their intellectual endeavors.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we attempt to show the fruitfulness of the theory of communicative action for memory studies. Specifically, we intend to demonstrate that concepts characteristic of the discipline, such as "history," "memory," and "dialogue," reflect three types of universal validity claims: "memory" formulates claims to authenticity, "history" formulates claims to truth, and "dialogue" formulates claims to Tightness. Thus, it is possible to introduce a seminal Habermasian notion of rationality that rests on validity claims. This notion can serve to integrate, enrich, and identify blind spots in memory studies. Our purpose is to demonstrate the relevance of collective memory to social cohesion (cultural reproduction, social integration, and socialization) and the public sphere (its development and atrophy, rationalization, and colonization).<br>

Abstract: The three novels in English that won in the Centennial Literary Contest are very different in their approaches to imagining the nation. And yet, in some of the most important aspects of constructing a narrative of the nation, they stand in very much the same position in relation to its colonial experience. The importance of narratives in understanding current attitudes about the Philippine experience makes it imperative that these three valorized novels are studied closely and as a set. This paper argues that these novels fail to liberate for they adopt a cavalier attitude toward history and fall prey to the cultural logic of late capitalism<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between teacher education and the ideology of social control. It does this by looking at the dialectical tension that exists between teacher-education programs and the dominant society through a set of concepts that link as well as demonstrate the interplay of power, ideology, biography, and history. It further illuminates this interplay by analyzing the rationality that presently dominates these programs. Finally, the paper not only examines the implications of this rationality for teacher-education programs, it also points to ways in which it can be overcome.<br>

Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Abstract: Following debates within this journal regarding the absence of adequate studies of resistance in the contemporary fields of industrial sociology and organisational behaviour, this paper seeks to understand its reasons and consequences. Through an examination of the history of approaches to the study of power and resistance at work, the grounds for this debate are considered and illuminated. The paper then suggests how this debate might be taken forward through developing the ideas of tactics and strategies and episodic and dispositional power.<br>

Abstract: The entire medieval period is dominated by an eschatological textuality which posits for the history of salvation a singulative movement through time, from creation to eschaton. In book 12 of De civitate Dei, Augustine provides theoretical background for this epochal model; the most cogent statement of its content is found in book 6 of Hugh of Saint Victor's Didascalicon. This type of textuality, whose formal properties are identified, is already marked in Augustine by its exclusion of the purely iterative view of time held by pagan philosophers. From the twelfth century, however, singulative eschatological textuality assimilates an iterative model of the progression of time as it finds expression in metaphorically informed statements concerning the liturgical year. From Jean Beleth to Jacobus de Voragine, the figure of assimilatio facilitates the conflation of a discretelinear and an iterative model of temporality in such representations, the logical relations within which are analyzed here.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: In a first section, the renewed interest in historical consciousness among social scientists and historians is discussed, which resulted in a clearer understanding of how historical memory functions and of the diverse ways in which historians use references to the past. Against this background, Paul's use of history in the letter to the Galatians is analysed in a second section. The apostle is not interested in recording the past, but develops, in the light of his own experiences in preaching the gospel among gentiles, an alternative perspective on Israel's past. By taking the figure of Abraham as his point of departure, he argues for a more inclusive understanding of Israel's history, which enables him to provide a theological justification for the equal status of gentile believers in the community of faith.<br>

Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the concept of historical consciousness has been central to didactic research in Sweden. It has mostly been used as a theoretical framework on a macro-level or as an attempt to identify students' historical consciousness. This article applies the theoretical concept of historical consciousness to tangible source material:history textbooks from the twentieth century. It focuses on whether Swedish history textbooks for lower secondary school have articulated contexts that may be conducive to developing historical consciousness. The article employs a number of theoretical concepts—narratives, multichronology, identity, and values—in order to analyze perspectives that can be utilized to trigger historical consciousness.<br>

Abstract: This article considers the changing relationship between Balzac and theory from the 1970s onwards when Balzac was a favoured, if disparaged, object of theorization, as in Barthes s S/Z. More recent critics, however, see the multi-layered énunciations of/in his texts as evidence of their ability to theorize their own relationship to history, society, sexuality — and literature. In the same way, moreover, as texts such as Sarrasine and Une passion dans le désert critique their own relation to literature, ostensibly theoretical Balzac texts such as Une théorie de la démarche turn theory into a form of fiction. Whether moving from literature to theory or from theory to literature, Balzac — or 'Balzac'/Balzac — is thus shown to be (at) a nexus of literature, theory and literary theory.<br>

Abstract: This article explores ways in which narrative retelling and remembering might provide cathartic release for sufferers of trauma. It looks at examples drawn from genocide, literature, history and psychotherapy. It draws particularly from Aristotle's theory of mythos-mimesis and Ricceur's theory of narrative configuration.<br>

Abstract: In Arendt's interrogations of political modernity, the concepts of history and politics have an ambiguous relation. On the one hand, she insisted that the performative character of politics as action was bound to its narrative aspect as remembrance. She was also a fervent proponent of integrating the historical sense into political understanding. On the other hand, Arendt characterized the modern historical sensibility from the point of view of politics as a "ghastly absurdity," and asserted that the political thought of our times needed to free itself both "from history" and "from thinking in historical terms." This paper explores the different meanings that Arendt granted to "history" as a (anti) political force and to historical sensibility as the basis for political understanding. It argues that not only were Arendt's rejection of the modern concept of history and its politics of history central for her critique, but that it was one of the key concerns that shaped the articulation of her own theory of action. The paper also examines the problem against the background of the intellectual tradition of Arendt's youth and in particular its uncompromising antihistoricism.<br>

Abstract: The Bible is an important text in American history, but research analyzing the social consequences of reading the Bible is very limited. Research focusing on religious practices or religiosity with Bible reading as part of a scale shows a tendency towards conservatism and traditionalism, as do more literalist views of the Bible. In the present study, biblical literalism is treated as a powerful context guiding one's reading. The focus here is a quantitative view of Bible reading, deploying two 'conservative' and two 'liberal' moral/political scales and two competing views for how Bible reading may function. Results indicate that Bible reading is positively related to both of the liberal scales as well as the conservative scales for non-literalists, but not for those with literalist Bible views. The findings begin to show the importance of independent Bible reading, how it may function differently for literalists and non-literalists, and highlights the degree to which literalism and Bible reading are different constructs.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Author(s): Conan Michel<br>
Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Author(s): WOLICKA ELŻBIETA<br>
Abstract: The article of Elzbieta Wolicka is consecrated to the consideration of the phenomenon of time taken in the contexts of individual human experience, contemporary cultural situation and Christian faith. The starting point of the 1st part of the article is the fragment of Confessiones (ch. XI) of St. Augustine and the short parable of Franz Kafka entitled HE. The author of the article brings to the light the dialogical basis of the human perception of time and raises up the quaestion of "a hidden sabotage of trust" which is characteristic to the social relations of our times. This is also the one among many other factors of the so called "crisis of culture" (mal du siècle). The crisis consists of a feeling of a threat, a burden of the past and a fear of the future. The 2nd part of the article is concerned with the analysis of the eschatological meaning of some words of Christ in the Gospel of St. John (4, 23; 5, 25-29; 12, 13; 12, 27, 31). They reveal the Christian sense of the human temporal condition in the light of "the economy of salvation" and the dialogue between a believer and God. A catastrophic thrill, a feeling of existential paradox, a blockage of communication - the symptoms of the crisis of cultural conscience - could be described as "the edipse of God" (M. Buber) or "the abandonment of God" (J. Ellul) in the contemporary world. The Gospel points out that in the heart of human temporal experience there is still existing conversatio sacra and the presence of God in our history is actual.<br>

Abstract: This essay offers a history of a basic writing course that began at a public ivy campus in the 1970s. Relying on principles of universal design and on insights derived from his school's studio program about ways the institution's selective functions can impact curricular matters, the author describes how the basic writing course was merely retrofitted to an English Department's goals, rather than integrated into its mainstream business. In turn, the author suggests that historical studies such as this can help basic writing teachers excavate and reinvigorate demoaatic reform efforts often backgrounded in light of a school's elite reputation.<br>

Abstract: In sixteenth-century France, the triumphal entry was closely tied to the notion of collective memory. This article defines the concept of collective memory as it is articulated in sixteenth-century texts, retraces the history of the relationship between this notion and the triumphal entry, and, in analyzing several texts tied to entry ceremonies, explores how such texts address triumphal entries' role in the production of collective memory—as opposed to its preservation, which is the typical focus in discussions of the relationship between collective memory and historiographical or poetic works during this period.<br>

Abstract: The 1990s and 2000s saw a memory and remembrance boom at both the national and supra-/transnational level. Crucially, many of these emerging memory frames were not simply about a glorious and heroic past, as in, for example, traditional nationalist narratives. Rather, groups started to narrate their symbolic boundaries in a more inclusive way by admitting past wrongdoings. In this article, we look at a corpus of so-called 'speculative speeches' by leading politicians in the European Union and, against the aforementioned historical background, analyse their representations of Europe's past, present and future. By utilising the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse analysis, narrative theory and elements of Reinhart Koselleck's conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte), we illustrate how, first, a 'new Europe', based on admitting failure, is narrated. However, second, we also show that such a self-critical narration of a 'bitter past' is, paradoxically, transformed into a self-righteous attitude towards Europe's 'others'.<br>

Abstract: Thousands of child Holocaust survivors arrived in Montreal, Quebec, between 1947 and 1952, looking to remake their lives, rebuild their families, and recreate their communities. Integration was not seamless. As survivors struggled to carve spaces for themselves within the established Canadian Jewish community, their difficult wartime stories were neither easily received nor understood. When remembering this period, survivors tend to speak about employment, education, dating, integration into both the pre-war Jewish community and the larger society, and, perhaps most importantly, the creation of their own social worlds within existing and new frameworks. Forged in a transitional and tumultuous period in Quebec's history, these social worlds, as this article demonstrates, are an important example of survivor agency. Although survivors recall the ways in which Canadian Jews helped them adjust to their new setting, by organizing a number of programs and clubs within various spaces—Jeanne Mance House, the Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association, and the Jewish Public Library—they also speak about how they forged their own paths upon arriving in this postwar city. For instance, survivors created the New World Club, an informal and grassroots social organization where they could prioritize their own needs and begin to be understood as people, and not just survivors. Establishing the interconnections between these formal and informal social worlds, and specifically, how survivors navigated them, is central to understanding the process through which they were able to move beyond their traumatic pasts and start over. Nightmares and parties are parts of the same story, and here the focus is on the memories of young survivors who prioritized their social worlds. Des milliers d'enfants survivants de l'Holocauste sont arrivés à Montréal, au Québec, entre 1947 et 1952, cherchant à refaire leurs vies, reconstruire leurs familles et recréer leurs communautés. L'intégration n'était pas sans faille. Non seulement les survivants ont-ils du mal à se tailler une place au sein de la communauté juive canadienne existante, leurs pénibles récits de la guerre ne sont ni facilement reçus, ni facilement compris. Se rappelant cette période, les survivants ont tendance à parler de l'emploi, de l'éducation, de rencontres et d'intégration à la fois dans la communauté juive et la société d'avant-guerre et, plus encore, de la création de leurs propres univers sociaux dans de cadres établis ou récents. Créés dans une période transitoire et tumultueuse de l'histoire du Québec, ces mondes sociaux, comme le montre cet article, sont un exemple important de la volonté d'agir des survivants. Bien que les survivants rappellent comment les Juifs du Canada les ont aidés à s'adapter à leur nouveau contexte, en organisant un certain nombre déprogrammes et de clubs au sein de différents espaces - Jeanne Mance House, la Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association et la Jewish Public Library - ils racontent aussi comment ils ont forgé leur propre voies en arrivant dans cette ville d'aprèsguerre. Par exemple, les survivants ont créés le New World Club, un organisme social informel et populaire où ils pouvaient donner priorité à leurs propres besoins et commencer à être compris comme êtres humains et non seulement comme survivants. Démontrer les interconnexions entre ces mondes sociaux formels et informels et, plus particulièrement, comment les survivants y ont navigué, est essentiel à la compréhension du processus par lequel ils ont pu dépasser leurs expériences traumatiques et repartir à zéro. Cauchemars et fêtes sont deux versants d'une même histoire; l'accent ici est mis sur les souvenirs des jeunes survivants qui ont accordé la priorité à leurs mondes sociaux.<br>

Abstract: L'article analyse les difficultés de constitution d'un champ de recherches autonome autour de la ville en France tout en repérant les fructueuses pistes ouvertes par les recherches récentes pour cerner la spécificité de l'urbain. Trois d'entre elles sont approfondies: l'entrée par l'espace, l'attention à la diversité des acteurs, la valorisation du changement urbain. Ces trois interrogations sont déclinées sur des terrains urbains variés et des époques différentes, montrant que les convergences de la recherche en histoire urbaine passent par un intérêt primordial pour l'expérimentation et le dialogue avec d'autres disciplines. This paper analyzes the difficulties of conducting independent research on the subject of the city in France, while exploring fruitful areas of study opened by recent scholarship that defines the urban specificity. Three of these areas are dealt with in depth: the introduction of space as an analytical tool, attention to diverse forces, and the development of urban changes. These three areas draw upon varied urban fields of study at different times, thus showing how urban history research converges on key subjects for experimentation and dialogue with other disciplines.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Abstract: Seeking to understand the manifest in relation to the implicit and the unstated-the unconscious of the conscious-this paper focuses on the elusiveness of social consciousness in a transitional colonial society with a rich heritage of its own. The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.<br>

Abstract: The paper argues that the development of recording data over the following five thousand years can be regarded as chapters in a basically continuous narrative. This continuity explains why Plato s reflections on the oral and the written, and Aristotle's remarks on memory and reminiscence, are still relevant in our globalised world. In the conclusion, the paper comments on Paul Ricoeur s attempt to bridge the gap between memory, history, and forgetting, as well as on its controversial political implications.<br>

Abstract: Focusing on the difference between traditional hermeneutics and more scientifically oriented approaches to literature, this essay argues that our understanding of currently debated issues—such as whether a canon should and/or can be abolished—is significantly increased if one formulates nomological theories that can be empirically tested. To stimulate further research of this kind, two "laws" of literary history are proposed.<br>

Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: While the Good Friday Agreement heralded a new beginning in Northern Ireland, its promotion of amnesty and amnesia, and its "rhetorical dismemberment of the past," effectively occluded the experiences of victims. Rather than engage in the seductive embrace of cultural amnesia, much Northern Irish art focuses upon the dangers of forgetting the past. For visual artists and writers alike, a wilful neglect of history may result in the return of the repressed and in psychic breakdown on both the communal and individual levels. Works by Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, and Willie Doherty use the trope of "haunting" to allow readers/viewers to bear witness to the plight of those left behind by the Agreement's rhetoric and to understand their post-conflict trauma. Bien que l'Accord du Vendredi saint annonçât un nouveau début pour l'Irlande du Nord, il eut comme résultat, de par sa promotion d'une amnistie combinée à une amnésie forcée, ainsi que son démembrement rhétorique du passé, de nier le vécu des victimes. Plutôt que de se laisser subjuguer par la séduction de l'amnésie culturelle, une grande partie de l'expression artistique de l'Irlande du Nord se concentre sur le danger d'oublier le passé. Pour les plasticiens aussi bien que les écrivains, une négligence délibérée de l'histoire pourrait ramener la répression et occasionner des blessures psychiques aussi bien au niveau communautaire que de l'individu. Les œuvres de Jack Pakenham, Ciaran Carson, Colin Davidson, Frank McGuinness, et Willie Doherty déploient le trope de la « hantise » pour permettre aux lecteurs et au public de témoigner de la souffrance de ceux qui ont été laissés pour compte par la rhétorique de l'Accord, et de mieux comprendre leur traumatisme post-conflit<br>

Abstract: Can a historical event, such as Partition, be understood as an action that "resulted" from complex, wide forces of history or also as an event continually brought into being by the play of subject memories? A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, provedeno je kao studija slučaja empirijsko istraživanje mladenačke službe božje u mega crkvama Južne Koreje. Korejsko je sluèaj važan jer Koreja predstavlja jednu od najjaèih kršèanskih populacija u svijetu, dok je s druge strane izložena izazovima kao što je primjerice pad broja mladih vjernika i ogromni generacijski jaz u njezinim crkvenim kongregacijama. Razmatranje mladenačkih kongregacija u sedam mega crkava u Seulu i tekstuaina analiza mladenačke službe božje s težištem na glazbu pruža informacije kóje povezuju filozofske rasprave o teologiji glazbe s pitanjem identiteta uključenog u hermeneutiku glazbene prakse u crkvama. Semiotièki prístup glazbenoj analizi prihvaèen je kao korisno sredstvo za povezivanje ovih empirijskih podataka s njihovim filozofijskim interpretacijama i za ispitivanje glazbene štruktúre i narativne štruktúre tekstova.<br>

Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: Ritual studies is a new discipline within the field of the study of religion. Liturgical theology is, in the West, a recent development within the Held of systematic theology. The article describes each and indicates ways in which they may contribute to the work of the other while retaining their separate identities. The development of methods for describing and analyzing ritual action may enable liturgical theology to construct its own analyses upon a more broadly phenomenological base. At the same time theology's insight into the history of liturgical action may enable ritual studies to overcome an excessively synchronie perspective and to attend to the normative character of ritual gesture.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

L'approche ne se limite pas à la question de la médiation unique du Christ. Elle aborde aussi le rapport du Christ à l'histoire et au cosmos, le sens de la mission de l'Église, sa relation au judaïsme, la signification du salut et la façon de l'envisager dans le cadre d'une pluralité des religions. Au long de sa présentation, l'auteur de cette Note montre que la théologie développée dans cet ouvrage se trouvait déjà largement amorcée dans les précédents travaux de Duquoc. This Note introduces the work of Christian Duquoc, entitled L'unique Christ. La symphonie différée, surveying its development and paying particular attention to its Christological contribution. Its approach is not limited to the question of Christ's unique mediation. It takes up as well Christ's relation to history and to the cosmos, the meaning of the Church's mission, its relation to Judaism, its signification of salvation, and the way of envisaging it within the setting of a plurality of religions. During the course of his presentation, the author of this Note shows that the theology developed in this work was largely initiated in Duquoc's earlier works.<br>

Abstract: Whereas the spoken word is part of present actuality, the written word normally is not. The writer, in isolation, constructs a role for his "audience" to play, and readers fictionalize themselves to correspond to the author's projection. The way readers fictionalize themselves shifts throughout literary history: Chaucer, Lyly, Nashe, Hemingway, and others furnish cases in point. All writing, from scientific monograph to history, epistolary correspondence, and diary writing, fictionalizes its readers. In oral performance, too, some fictionalizing of audience occurs, but in the live interaction between narrator and audience there is an existential relationship as well: the oral narrator modifies his story in accord with the real-not imagined-fatigue, enthusiasm, or other reactions of his listeners. Fictionalizing of audiences correlates with the use of masks or personae marking human communication generally, even with oneself. Lovers try to strip off all masks, and oral communication in a context of love can reduce masks to a minimum. In written communication and, a fortiori, print the masks are less removable.<br>

Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Abstract: Historiography in Francoist Spain (1939-75) sought to affirm the morally and historically correct role of the regime within the flow of Spanish history. As an important vehicle of dissidence, the novel of memory stands in sharp contrast to Francoist history: it explores the past largely eschewed or appropriated by the regime and contests the so-called truths that Franco shaped through the discourse of myth. This essay examines the role of subjective memory as a challenge to historiography and discloses the narrative strategies novelists used to counter the government's myths. Unlike Francoist historiography, the novel of memory lays out history as a series of disruptions and undermines the referential illusion of truth and wholeness in our understanding of the past.<br>

Abstract: The Mexican state's use of revolutionary history to invoke nationalistic sentiments nurtures a lively tradition of storytelling. Ironically, Buena Vista's storytellers criticize the inauthenticity of official representations of the past even as they draw on the images and ideals of "official" history to weave their own tales. This article argues that discourses of authenticity reinscribe historic distinctions between the community and the state in a language which evokes modern notions of purity and truth. The article highlights the political role of discourses of authenticity within the hegemonic structures of modern state power in Mexico.<br>

Abstract: On Mount Helicon dwelt the nine Muses, each presiding over a special art: Clio (history), Melpomene (tragedy), Calliope (epic poetry) Erato (lyric poetry), Thalia (comedy and pastoral poetry), Euterpe (music), Polhymnia (rhetoric and mime), Terpsichore (dance and choral singing), and Urania (astronomy). It was told that the beautiful Narcissus, in his sixteeneth year, first saw his reflection on one of the many fountains of Helicon. He did not listen to the Muses; rather he fell in love with his own reflection and was transformed into a flower.<br>

Abstract: This article describes fieldwork with Gypsy musicians of the Isten Gyülekezet, a Pentecostal church in southwest Hungary. Instrumental music performance represented a special form of leadership there, restricted by gender and based in secular cultural history as well as religious practice. Musicians and other believers interpreted my role as a woman ethnographer in contrasting ways. The exposure of these differences necessitates reflection upon the depth to which the ethnographer can know the world of the people with whom she works.<br>

Abstract: An approach to sociocultural analysis based on the ideas of Vygotsky, Bakhtin, and others is used to provide the foundation for discussing narratives as "cultural tools." The production of official, state sponsored historical narratives is examined from this perspective, and it is argued that this production process may be shaped as much by dialogic encounters with other narratives as by archival information. These claims are harnessed to examine the production of post-Soviet Russian history textbooks, especially their presentation of the events surrounding the Russian Civil War of 1918-20.<br>

Abstract: Embodied memories of terror and violence create new meaning and reorder the world, but in doing so they encompass the inexplicable aspects of cultural processes that have allowed the world one lives in to become an unspeakable place, hostile and death-ridden. In this article, we examine the narratives of Cambodian refugees' experiences of the Khmer Rouge regime against the backdrop of an ethnographic study of older Cambodians' lives in an inner-city neighborhood. The stories from this study of 40 Cambodians between the ages of 50 and 79 illustrate the relationship between bodily distress and memory, and between personal history and collective experience. These narratives reveal how people strive to create continuity in their lives but under certain circumstances are unable to do so.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates identity in two autobiographies and two life-history interviews from North Africa. The autobiographies show the centrality of "key" self-representational symbols which the authors selectively draw from their cultural lexicon but invest with idiosyncratic affective meanings. The life narratives show how the "structured ambiguity" of self-symbols allows them to be reconfigured to articulate contrasting identities, among which the narrators shift. Generative models of musical cognition describe crucial features of this multiplicity. Against both modernist and postmodernist views of culture and self, narrative data argue for a distributed model of culture and for a theory of multiple identities integrated by "key" cultural symbols.<br>

Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Abstract: This paper focuses upon the prevalent complementary definitions of myth and history and questions their analytic utility with reference to literary documents that bespeak the transition between mythic and historic cognition. In the style of ethnosemantic analysis, these definitions are treated as a semantic domain and subjected to formal analysis. The components elicited constitute a new definition - more precisely, a two-dimensional model of the relationship between myth and history. Subsequently, the model is applied to a series of books from the Bible with the conclusion that men and women are structurally equal since, in their roles as social actors, both represent different components of myth as well as history.<br>

Abstract: Kalapalo warrior biographies are concerned with dialogical processes of challenge, resistance, debate, and the negotiation of meaning - with the struggles that take place as people try to understand and experience anew. Although warriors were trained to aggressively defend their communities against enemies, these narratives describe how they attempted to refashion ideological forms connected with ethnic allegiance and moral community. The personalities of warriors, closely connected to the training they underwent in adolescence, are particularly important in this regard. While biographies are often understood as texts in which history is merely a context surrounding the progress of individuals, descriptions of personal development are shown here to constitute testimony about historical processes themselves, in this case the experiences of refugees fleeing from centers of European expansion in lowland South America.<br>

Abstract: Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana "cultures" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.<br>

Abstract: Kurata Hyakuzō’s
         The Priest and His Disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, 1916) contributed to the unprecedented rise of religious literature during the Taishō period. The development of the Japanese religious world and the growing interests in religion by Japanese intellectuals during this period encouraged Kurata to humanize Shinran and paved the way forThe Priest and His Disciplesto become a bestseller. AlthoughThe Priest and His Disciplesis much studied, the role of fiction played in the work based on the life of a medieval Buddhist priest remains unexplored. This study first provides a background toThe Priest and His Disciplesand explains why it aroused such interest at the time. It then treats the image of Shinran at the intersection of history and fiction by referring to the study of Michel de Certeau and investigates how Kurata constructed an image of Shinran as the “other” inThe Priest and His Disciplesand placed it in history and in legends about Shinran.<br>

Abstract: Public history sites like the West Indian Museum of Panama and the Miraflores Visitors Center have different approaches to narrating the Panama Canal story, ranging from tales of man’s triumph over nature and celebratory discourses of nationalist victories, to testimonies of the racial histories silenced by official renderings of the past. Given the important role of museums as educational institutions, sites that inform public opinion, and representational platforms for national tourism, this article explores the relationship these institutions forge between visitors and canal history. Through a comparative analysis of the narratives and experiential strategies at each site, I evaluate the degree to which Panamanians are cast as spectators in grandiose histories of triumph, or as agents, responsible for shaping the past, present and future. In contrast to these physical sites, I consider how The Society of Friends of the West Indian Museum of Panama constructs a living past through memory practices that challenge the petrified histories traditionally found in museums.<br>

Abstract: Ruben Borg's
         The Measureless Time of Joyce, Deleuze and Derridaargues that James Joyce'sFinnegans Wakemust be read as a singular attempt to represent the eccentric structure of post-human temporality. The book relocates theWakewithin a long history of philosophies of time as well as recent post-structuralist and information theory. Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida, Borg shows how Joyce's formal and narratological innovations enabled him to present a structure of time that does not obey the linear, humanistic progression of thebildungsromanbut instead manifests mechanical temporal economies of production and waste.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Jean Hatzfeld's
         Machete Season: The Killers in Rwanda Speak, a collection of testimonials by perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda. While surveying popular representations of killers in Rwanda, circulating theories about the 1994 genocide and the veracity of these killers' accounts, this article also investigates the production, edition, and translation of these killers' interviews. In particular, it focuses on Jean Hatzfeld's role as editor of these killers' testimonies and Innocent Rwililiza's position as translatorinterviewer. Contextualizing elements missing from these interviews——namely, concepts from Rwandan language, history, and culture, as well as broader psychosocial dimensions both pre- and post-genocide——this article problematizes Hatzfeld's depiction of these ““ordinary killers.””<br>

Abstract: The combinatory and ludic polyculturalism, the parodic transmutation of meanings and values, the open, multilingual hybridization [which] are the devices responsible for the constant feeding and refeeding of this “baroquizing” almagest: the carnivalized transencyclopedia of the new barbarians, where everything can coexist with everything. They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: The world is a large and various place. Those wishing to chart new planetary cartographies are finding many languages to study beyond the French–German–English triad that long dominated Western comparative studies, and they are developing new methods appropriate to the expanded scope of our field. The tough linguistic and political analyses that Emily Apter rightly wishes comparatists to pursue will best be carried forward by widening our cultural and linguistic horizons, and by employing the full variety of critical and theoretical approaches that can be included in our cartographic toolboxes today.<br>

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: In short, it is exposure to the experientially inspired and theoretically casual atmosphere of those early SPEP meetings—where neglected topics and unorthodox modes of thinking and speaking were encouraged in an undisciplined way—to which I owe the most. Of course, SPEP grew up. It has experienced its share of embarrassing upheavals, as the heavy presence of its own versions of the social and political prejudices in the larger culture became too obvious to ignore. But it is now a major event—the four-day anchor for a week-long convention that takes over hotels, runs multiple concurrent sessions, fosters satellite groups, and often follows established lines of discussion. Some even call it the alternative APA. Yet I am sure that as long as lifeworld experience continues to trump whatever it is currently fashionable to say about it, grown-up SPEP will retain enough of its original vitality and intellectual generosity so that another generation of aging academics will have cause to repeat our present thank-yous in another fifty years.<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: No doubt the rise of religion has not only posed a particular dilemma for critical theory but also provided a curious place to end this reflection. Having started my career doing philosophy of religion it is somewhat surprising to meet religion again as I turn to what surely must be at least a later phase of my career. I am reminded of Antonio's line from the Italian film
            C'eravamo Tanto Amati, translated asWe All Loved Each Other So Much: “We thought we could change the world, but the world changed us.” “Philosophers only interpret the world, the point is to change it,” so said Marx. But in a curious way those who would change the world are changed by it.<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: In the current rhetoric and epistemology of historiography, the issue is no longer to know whether narrative provides a legitimate mode of knowledge. It is to determine whether historians use narrative, and—if they do not—what alternative modes of discourse they may be employing. The examination of a specific corpus: studies published about the period of the German occupation in France, shows that historians now rely on different types of textual organization. While they still use at times a straight, linear type of narrative, they increasingly turn to genres that are low in narrativity or even devoid of it. Eschewing narrative, however, seems reserved for academic historians; story-telling still prevails in “popular” history. Furthermore, the classification offered here depends on a narrow definition of “narrative”; a more inclusive definition would admit more texts under the category “narrative,” thus producing a different taxonomy.<br>

Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>Link: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/utopianstudies.25.1.0001</a>

Abstract: Familial
         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's
               
                  , is bereft of supportive socio-cultural frameworks. Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>

Abstract: Este artigo se inicia refletindo sobre as várias maneiras que Gilberto Freyre usou o conceito-chave de mestiçagem e os campos culturais diferentes aos quais ele estendeu o seu uso — arquitetura, culinária, esporte, literatura, urbanismo, sociologia e até mesmo sexo. Chamando a atenção para os conceitos ou metáforas alternativas que se encontram na obra de Freyre — interpenetração, mistura, hibridismo, etc. — o artigo se volta para a discussão de uma metáfora que Freyre não usou, apesar de ter se tornado usual desde sua época: tradução cultural. Após uma breve história da idéia de tradução cultural, que inclui uma discussão de suas vantagens e desvantagens, o artigo termina com um estudo de caso de tradução tanto metafórica como cultural do conceito ocidental de liberdade para o Japão após a restauração imperial de 1868.<br>

Abstract: Examining Agamben's reception of Hannah Arendt, and especially
         The Human Condition, in his theorization of biopolitics, this essay argues thatHomo Sacer I, by identifying Arendt with a quasi-Straussian “political philosophy,” fails to acknowledge the complexity of her conception of history. Far from simply affirming the normative force of classical political categories, Arendt regards these as emerging from a living power of distinction that thinking, by showing the historical process that brings about the effacement of these distinctions, seeks to bring into view. Nevertheless, Arendt's conception of history is not without contradiction: while arguing that metaphysics went astray by subordinating praxis to poiesis, her very account of history suggests that this subordination is inevitable, since only a “poetic,” indeed violent, act of making a distinction can distinguish praxis from poiesis. Precisely this problem lies at the center of Agamben's early engagement with Arendt inThe Man without Content.<br>
