  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: One summer morning in 2013, I received a call from a vet who had been assisting me in my research on the ethics of pedigree dog breeding. She asked me to meet her at her canine reproduction clinic because she had been contacted by a client whose three-year–old male dog, Jake, had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer and was not expected to see the end of the summer. The owner had been given the diagnosis the previous day, and the clinic was her first port of call. The vet did not offer any hope of a cure for<br>

  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: I intend to approach the issue of tradition indirectly by first considering some problems connected with rhetorical agency. This strategy might seem awkward, if not actually dangerous, since it entangles two equally complex and disputed concepts. Nevertheless, I hope to show that, within the humanistic strand of rhetoric, these concepts are linked in a way that is not now recognized but has an important bearing on our understanding of both. Specifically, I argue that the humanistic approach entails a productively ambiguous notion of agency that positions the orator both as an individual who leads an audience and as a member<br>

  Abstract: Marcel Proust’s
                     In Search of Lost Timeis a powerful account of mimetic desire. Proust confronts us with the bankruptcy of the narrator’s desires as well as with our own; so also does he enable us to participate in the narrator’s release from the strictures of desire and his transformation. Chronicling hope and not only despair, the narrator ofIn Search of Lost Timeattests to salvation that is threaded through life trauma.<br>

  Abstract: Haiti, the first black republic in the world, achieved its independence from France in 1804 and entered its postcolonial era in the complex position of being both a pariah for colonizing and slaveholding nations, as well as a source of hope for the enslaved and colonized. Since its independence, the nation has been plagued domestically by political instability, economic stagnation, and environmental degradation, while suffering political nonrecognition, military occupation, and economic management and sanctions by the international community. Two hundred years after its independence, Haiti is infamous for being the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Statistics are often unreliable,<br>

It begins, literally and figuratively, with a prelude, and dwells on the minute particulars of both the music and its performance. The idea is to embark in medias res without too firm a sense of ultimate direction.

  Author(s) FISCHER MICHAEL M. J.<br>
  Abstract: Subjective experiences of clinical scientists who produce and deliver high-technology medicine and of patients who receive treatment via this technology are fundamental to understanding the political economy and culture of hope that underlie bioscience and biomedicine. In this essay, I examine interpretive concepts linking bioscience and biotechnology and their societal institutions to subjective experience. These concepts are the medical imaginary, the biotechnical embrace, the political economy of hope, and the clinical narrative. Drawing on research and observations of the culture and political economy of biomedicine in the United States and internationally, I illustrate these interpretive concepts with examples from studies<br>

  Book Title: The Maternal Factor-Two Paths to Morality<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Noddings Nel<br>
  Abstract: In this provocative new book, renowned educator and philosopher Nel Noddings extends her influential work on the ethics of care toward a compelling objective—global peace and justice. She asks: If we celebrate the success of women becoming more like men in professional life, should we not simultaneously hope that men become more like women—in caring for others, rejecting violence, and valuing the work of caring both publicly and personally? Drawing on current work on evolution, and bringing concrete examples from women’s lived experience to make a strong case for her position, Noddings answers this question by locating one source of morality in maternal instinct. She traces the development of the maternal instinct to natural caring and ethical caring, offering a preliminary sketch of what a care-driven concept of justice might look like. Finally, to advance the cause of caring, peace, and women’s advancement, Noddings urges women to abandon institutional, patriarchal religion and to seek their own paths to spirituality.<br>

  Abstract: Martin Heidegger expressed his hope to Bultmann in 1964 that “your whole work might not remain entirely obscured by the label ‘demythologizing.’”² In one sense it is deeply unfortunate that Heidegger’s wish was unfulfilled. Bultmann’s name is forever associated with that controversial label, to such an extent that many are unable to read him without assuming that every writing of his is a threat to the church and harmful to the faith. In another and more important sense, however, we can be

  Abstract: In “Place, Pastness, Poems,” Seamus Heaney quotes this passage from T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” to support his view that in lieu of a cultural center the literary tradition is what links “the private experience of a poet to the usual life of the age.”¹ For Heaney, tradition allows the regional poet to affirm the centrality of local experience to his own being, but with the hope of making that experience accessible to readers from wholly different walks of life. Ideally, by raising private experience to the level of cultural expression, Heaney would have tradition transform personal memory into cultural memory.<br>

  Abstract: How to pass on “the faith”? We certainly are not the first generation—and I hope not the last—to ask this question. One can find evidence of such concerns, sometimes oblique, other times explicit, in Paul’s letters, among the earliest extant Christian writings. A host of difficult questions came early to those communities that the first apostles founded. What does it mean to believe in the name of Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified, the cruelest, the most despised, the most shocking form of empire-orchestrated execution?

Nevertheless, in the same moment that, in this document and others, Vatican II was opening the windows of the Church to dialogue, it opened onto a modern world that was already passing—if, in fact, it had ever really been.

  Abstract: The prospects do not seem bright for an appropriation of postmodern insights in the service of a Cluistian interpretation and critique of contemporary culture. Philosophical postmodernism is widely seen as being, at best, the moral equivalent of leprosy and, at worst, the moral equivalent of AIDS. The need to demonize runs deep. How else do we persuade ourselves, in spite of the evidence to the contrary, that we are really good, the last, best hope of the world? So it is that the temptation to lump postmodernism together with Hitler and Stalin is simply irresistible to some.<br>

  Book Title: Toward a Theology of Eros: Transfiguring Passion at the Limits of Discipline-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLER CATHERINE<br>
  Abstract: What does theology have to say about the place of eroticism in the salvific transformation of men and women, even of the cosmos itself? How, in turn, does eros infuse theological practice and transfigure doctrinal tropes? Avoiding the well-worn path of sexual moralizing while also departing decisively from Anders Nygren's influential insistence that Christian agape must have nothing to do with worldly eros, this book explores what is still largely uncharted territory in the realm of theological erotics. The ascetic, the mystical, the seductive, the ecstatic-these are the places where the divine and the erotic may be seen to converge and love and desire to commingle.Inviting and performing a mutual seduction of disciplines, the volume brings philosophers, historians, biblical scholars, and theologians into a spirited conversation that traverses the limits of conventional orthodoxies, whether doctrinal or disciplinary. It seeks new openings for the emergence of desire, love, and pleasure, while challenging common understandings of these terms. It engages risk at the point where the hope for salvation paradoxically endangers the safety of subjects-in particular, of theological subjects-by opening them to those transgressions of eros in which boundaries, once exceeded, become places of emerging possibility.The eighteen chapters, arranged in thematic clusters, move fluidly among and between premodern and postmodern textual traditions-from Plato to Emerson, Augustine to Kristeva, Mechthild to Mattoso, the Shulammite to Molly Bloom, the Zohar to the Da Vinci Code. In so doing, they link the sublime reaches of theory with the gritty realities of politics, the boundless transcendence of God with the poignant transience of materiality.<br>

  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

                  phenomenological metaphysicsis a metaphysics in which one refuses to investigate the essential structures of a mind-independent reality and concentrates, instead, on examining those ethical and religious values (for example, hope and faith) that enable persons to be closer to one another in a spiritual sense. Yet, metaphysics in this sense transcends philosophy proper; it involves<br>

  Book Title: Karl Jaspers: An Introduction to His Philosophy-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): WALLRAFF CHARLES FREDERIC<br>
  Abstract: The thought of the late Karl Jaspers, co-founder of the existentialist movement, has long exerted a powerful influence on world opinion. But, surprisingly, though translations of his writings have appeared in over 160 editions in 16 countries, his strictly philosophical work has hitherto been largely inaccessible to American audiences. Even where adequate English translations exist, the difficulties imposed by Jaspers' involved reasoning, intricate style, and ingenious neologisms are such that few unfamiliar with Continental philosophy can hope to acquire an understanding of his ideas on their own.<br>

  Book Title: Dis-Enclosure: The Deconstruction of Christianity-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Smith Michael B.<br>
  Abstract: This book is a profound and eagerly anticipated investigation into what is left of a monotheistic religious spirit-notably, a minimalist faith that is neither confessional nor credulous. Articulating this faith as works and as an objectless hope, Nancy deconstructs Christianity in search of the historical and reflective conditions that provided its initial energy. Working through Blanchot and Nietzsche, re-reading Heidegger and Derrida, Nancy turns to the Epistle of Saint James rather than those of Saint Paul, discerning in it the primitive essence of Christianity as hope. The religion that provided the exit from religion,as he terms Christianity, consists in the announcement of an end. It is the announcement that counts, however, rather than any finality. In this announcement there is a proximity to others and to what was once called parousia. But parousia is no longer presence; it is no longer the return of the Messiah. Rather, it is what is near us and does not cease to open and to close, a presence deferred yet imminent.In a demystified age where we are left with a vision of a self-enclosed world-in which humans are no longer mortals facing an immortal being, but entities whose lives are accompanied by the time of their own decline-parousia stands as a question. Can we venture the risk of a decentered perspective, such that the meaning of the world can be found both inside and outside, within and without our so-immanent world?The deconstruction of Christianity that Nancy proposes is neither a game nor a strategy. It is an invitation to imagine a strange faith that enacts the inadequation of life to itself. Our lives overflow the self-contained boundaries of their biological and sociological interpretations. Out of this excess, wells up a fragile, overlooked meaning that is beyond both confessionalism and humanism.<br>

  Book Title: The Executed God-The Way of the Cross in Lockdown America<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Taylor Mark Lewis<br>
  Abstract: The new edition of Mark Lewis Taylor’s award-winning The Executed God is both a searing indictment of the structures of “Lockdown America" and a visionary statement of hope. It is also a call for action to Jesus followers to resist US imperial projects and power. Outlining a “theatrics of state terror," Taylor identifies and analyzes its instruments—mass incarceration, militarized police tactics, surveillance, torture, immigrant repression, and capital punishment—through which a racist and corporatized Lockdown America enforces in the US a global neoliberal economic and political imperialism. Against this, The Executed God proposes a “counter-theatrics to state terror," a declamation of the way of the cross for Jesus followers that unmasks the powers of US state domination and enacts an adversarial politics of resistance, artful dramatic actions, and the building of peoples’ movements. These are all intrinsic to a Christian politics of remembrance of the Jesus executed by empire. Heralded in its first edition, this new edition is thoroughly revised, updated, and expanded, offering a demanding rethinking and recreating of what being a Christian is and of how Christianity should dream, hope, mobilize, and act to bring about what Taylor terms “a liberating material spirituality" to unseat the state that kills.<br>

  Book Title: From North to South-Southern Scholars Engage with Edward Schillebeeckx<br>

  Abstract: From North to South brings together the interests in Edward Schillebeeckx of eight theologians from Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia. In each chapter, theologians dialogue from a southern context with one of Schillebeeckx’s themes or methods. Themes such as suffering and negative contrast experiences, political holiness, ecclesiology, God and the cross, resurrection and hope, and theology and culture are addressed. Attention to Schillebeeckx’s hermeneutics lies at the heart of several chapters but is generally woven throughout. Contributors bring their particular southern contexts into serious dialogue with Schillebeeckx’s northern thought. The book concludes with a response to the south from North American theologian, Kathleen McManus OP. In short, the book witnesses to the ongoing challenge and stimulation of Edward Schillebeeckx’s theology.<br>

However, high gas levels and the delay of receiving Australian robotic equipment led to a stalemate.

  Book Title: Redemptive Hope: From the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Obama-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Campbell Timothy C.<br>
  Abstract: This is a book about the need for redemptive narratives to ward off despair and the dangers these same narratives create by raising expectations that are seldom fulfilled. The quasi-messianic expectations produced by the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, and their diminution, were stark reminders of an ongoing struggle between ideals and political realities. Redemptive Hope begins by tracing the tension between theistic thinkers, for whom hope is transcendental, and intellectuals, who have striven to link hopes for redemption to our intersubjective interactions with other human beings. Lerner argues that a vibrant democracy must draw on the best of both religious thought and secular liberal political philosophy. By bringing Richard Rorty's pragmatism into conversation with early-twentieth-century Jewish thinkers, including Martin Buber and Ernst Bloch, Lerner begins the work of building bridges, while insisting on holding crucial differences in dialectical tension. Only such a dialogue, he argues, can prepare the foundations for modes of redemptive thought fit for the twenty-first century.<br>

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Book Title: Horror and Its Aftermath-Reconsidering Theology and Human Experience<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Stamper Sally<br>
  Abstract: Theological anthropology often brings psychology to bear on the contingent nature of human existence in relationship to God. In this volume, Sally Stamper articulates one modern trajectory of theological recourse to psychology (comprising Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, and Tillich) as the ground on which she brings clinical psychoanalytic theory and early childhood studies into conversation with fundamental questions about the relationship of God to human suffering and its remediation. She develops her argument from the assertions that human experience evolves within an awareness of human vulnerability to profound suffering and that insight into consequent human anxiety is a powerful resource for soteriology, eschatology, and theological anthropology. Stamper narrates this “normative anxiety" by integrating object relations theories of early childhood development and critical readings of literary texts for young children. She gestures toward a new eschatological vision that poses the radical otherness of a transcendent God as key to divine remediation of human suffering, in the process building on Marilyn McCord Adams’s soteriological response to human horror-participation and on Jonathan Lear’s assertion of radical hope in response to catastrophic collapse of cultural resources for making meaning.<br>

At these junctures, the most profound manifestation of human darkness is evidenced in the horror that touches on human life, even on the happiest lives, to some degree, and that at its worst would seem to destroy all possibility of hope.

  Book Title: Radical Theology-An Essay on Faith and Theology in the Twenty-First Century<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Dalferth Ingolf U.<br>
  Abstract: Ingolf U. Dalferth develops a “radical theology" that unfolds the orienting strength of faith for human life from the event of God’s presence to every present. In a concise and clear manner, Dalferth outlines the theological and philosophical approaches to hermeneutics in the modern era, in order to promote a convincing and defensible theology for the twenty-first century, critically carrying on Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann, without forgetting Karl Barth. The result of his reconstruction is a “radical theology" that neither glorifies premodern theology in an antimodern attitude nor seeks a mystical deepening of the secular, but argues for a radical change in theological perspective of the possible. In doing so, theology unfolds “limit concepts" that restrict the claims of science and philosophy critically, and develops “ideas of orientation" that illumine the ways in which human life is understood and lived in radically new ways in faith. From here, Dalferth unfolds the reality of revelation and the Christian sense of an unconditional hope that fundamentally transcends all beliefs based on mundane realities and orients the world on something beyond its own temporal horizon—its loving Creator.<br>

  Book Title: A Passion for the Possible: Thinking with Paul Ricoeur-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): VENEMA HENRY ISAAC<br>
  Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's entire philosophical project narrates a passion for the possibleexpressed in the hope that in spite of death, closure, and sedimentation, life is opened by superabundance, by how the world gives us much more than is possible. Ricoeur's philosophical anthropology is a phenomenology of human capacity, which gives onto the groundless ground of human being, namely, God. Thus the story of the capable man, beginning with original goodness held captive by a servile will and ending with the possibility of liberation and regeneration of the heart, underpins his passion for the more than possible. The essays in this volume trace the fluid movement between phenomenological and religious descriptions of the capable self that emerges across Ricoeur's oeuvre and establish points of connection for future developments that might draw inspiration from this body of thought.<br>

  Book Title: Words of Life: New Theological Turns in French Phenomenology-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Words of Life is the sequel and companion to Phenomenology and the Theological Turn,edited by Dominique Janicaud, Jean-Francois Courtine, Jean-Louis Chrtien, Michel Henry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur. In that volume, Janicaud accuses Levinas, Henry, Marion, and Chrtien of veeringfrom phenomenological neutrality to a theologically inflected phenomenology. By contrast, the contributors to this collection interrogate whether phenomenology's proper starting point is agnostic or atheistic. Many hold the view that phenomenology after the theological turn may very well be true both to itself and to the phenomenological things themselves.In one way or another, all of these essays contend with the limits and expectations of phenomenology. As such, they are all concerned with what counts as properphenomenology and even the very structure of phenomenology. None of them, however, is limited to such questions. Indeed, the rich tapestry that they weave tells us much about human experience. Themes such as faith, hope, love, grace, the gift, the sacraments, the words of Christ, suffering, joy, life, the call, touch, listening, wounding, and humility are woven throughout the various meditations in this volume. The contributors use striking examples to illuminate the structure and limits of phenomenology and, in turn, phenomenology serves to clarify those very examples. Thus practice clarifies theory and theory clarifies practice, resulting in new theological turns and new life for phenomenology. The volume showcases the work of both senior and junior scholars, including Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste, Kevin Hart, Anthony J. Steinbock, Jeffrey Bloechl, Jeffrey L. Kosky, Clayton Crockett, Brian Treanor, and Christina Gschwandtner-as well as the editors themselves.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

  Book Title: Hope and the Longing for Utopia-Futures and Illusions in Theology and Narrative<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Boscaljon Daniel<br>
  Abstract: At present the battle over who defines our future is being waged most publicly by secular and religious fundamentalists. 'Hope and the Longing for Utopia' offers an alternative position, disclosing a conceptual path toward potential worlds that resist a limited view of human potential and the gift of religion. In addition to outlining the value of embracing unknown potentialities, these twelve interdisciplinary essays explore why it has become crucial that we commit to hoping for values that resist traditional ideological commitments. Contextualized by contemporary writing on utopia, and drawing from a wealth of times and cultures ranging from Calvin’s Geneva to early twentieth-century Japanese children’s stories to Hollywood cinema, these essays cumulatively disclose the fundamental importance of resisting tantalizing certainties while considering the importance of the unknown and unknowable. Beginning with a set of four essays outlining the importance of hope and utopia as diagnostic concepts, and following with four concrete examples, the collection ends with a set of essays that provide theological speculations on the need to embrace finitude and limitations in a world increasingly enframed by secularizing impulses. Overall, this book discloses how hope and utopia illuminate ways to think past simplified wishes for the future.<br>

  A Lament from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf6b4">Spiritual Complaint</a><br>
  Author(s) Klangwisan Yael<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that the form-critically identified laments of the Hebrew Bible can be understood via the performance concept of “framing.” In art, drama, and literature the frame lifts the work or event to a heightened consciousness and provides a context for practitioners and audiences to interact. My interest is in the link between frame (form) and content. I argue that the lament form provides a literary framework for the expression of anguish by empowering those who are suffering to name their pain, despite the constraints of the form that generally culminate in a leaning towards hope.

  Abstract: Hopes that the future of theology lies among the new “contextual” theologies of the “new Christianity” abound. Could these theologies replace the theologies of the Atlantic cultures with their roots in ancient theology and doctrine? For some this hope has given carte blanche to any theology from the global South that calls into question traditional “Western” theology. For others the emergence of non-Western Christian thinking is insignificant for it seems to have little to add to the theological debate. I believe these claims to be misleading and disingenuous.

  Abstract: The mystery of birth fills our existence with joy, hope, and wonder, but it does more than this as well:it calls us to ponder the mystery of the positivity of being. There are several layers of meaning to the mystery of being born, and these layers, though intrinsically and circularly related, are distinct but not independent. The first meaning, perhaps the most obvious but not the least important, is the biological. Life, the fruit of the loving union between a father and a mother, is given to us with and through a corporeal, organic existence. Our very body continually refers<br>

  Book Title: Making Memory-Jewish and Christian Explorations in Monument, Narrative, and Liturgy<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Vincent Alana M.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I engage dialectically with the idea of martyrdom, the second of Juergensmeyer’s symbols for understanding the link between violence and religion. I critique his claim that religious martyrdom and self-sacrifice are simply ritualized rites of destruction that in the eyes of religious agents leave the impression of a religious heroism that transforms history. Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

The Gift of Love presents a reason for hope that the signification of “the Trinity that God is," while impossible for human beings is not impossible for God.<br>

  Abstract: When people endure times of crisis or trauma, they often search for meaning and hope by engaging in a bidirectional reading of texts.

Doing so can help people to know that they are not alone in their suffering, thus fulfilling Donne’s axiom that “no man is an island, entire of itself.”¹ The other direction points toward texts and rituals in one’s religious faith and spiritual practices, seeking a linkage between one’s own story and a larger, transcendent story: one that recounts what is sacred or ultimate.<br>

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

War offers the hope of transforming hostile nations and peoples politically, culturally, and religiously, but also threatens to poison relations between victor and vanquished, liberator and liberated.

  Abstract: The term
                     neuroestheticsis of recent origin. It was coined by Semir Zeki, and the first conference on the theme was held in San Francisco in 2002. It reflected a somewhat older concept, such as that expounded by Alexander Luria in the 1970s, aimed at finding the neural basis for contemplating and creating artworks and studying it scientifically. In the next pages I shall attempt to link some personal aspects of art and esthetics to various biological observations, in the hope that the reader will accept plausible, but not definitive, interrelationships.<br>

  Abstract: THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION is inescapably ritualistic (one is received into the church by a solemn washing with water), uncompromisingly moral (“be ye perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect,” said Jesus), and unapologetically intellectual (be ready to give a “reason for the hope that is in you,” in the words of I Peter). Like all the major religions of the world, Christianity is more than a set of devotional practices and a moral code: it is also a way of thinking about God, about human beings, about the world and history. For Christians, thinking is part of believing. Augustine<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, when viewed in terms of the longue durée, French Maoism, which spanned the years 1966–74, was a relatively short-lived episode. In most cases revelations of the Cultural Revolution’s manifold persecutions and atrocities definitively cured the Maoists, as well as their “democratic” sympathizers, of their pro-Chinese leanings. One of the initial reasons they had turned to China was that the Soviet experiment in “really existing socialism” had been totally discredited. Maoism seemed the last best hope for a utopian alternative to the dislocations and disappointments of “really existing democracy.” But already during the early 1970s, the<br>

It may seem odd, even confounding, to introduce certain norms or “goods” where the notoriously crafty business of rhetoric is concerned. Today we have spin doctors and image consultants, audience-manipulators of every ideological stripe—hence the much discussed flight of audiences from the public arena. But this is not really so surprising. Rhetoric has always been a practiced imperfection, the worst fear of idealized reason and the best hope for whatever remains of civic life. This<br>

This is a shift in relational comportment, something like what Noëlle McAfee in Chapter 2, “Home, Hospitality, and the Cosmopolitan Address,” terms “cosmopolitan imaginary,” by which we think about “how and where we and others are<br>

  Book Title: Blood in the Sand-Imperial Fantasies, Right-Wing Ambitions, and the Erosion of American Democracy<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Bronner Stephen Eric<br>
  Abstract: Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, clouds of ash blackened the skies over New York City, Washington, D.C., and rural Pennsylvania. In the wake of the destruction, the United States seemingly entered a new era marked by radical changes in the nation's discourse and in the policies of the Bush administration. With the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq, and saber rattling elsewhere, America's global war on terror began to take shape. Lofty rhetoric about expanding democracy and defending freedom filled the halls of elite power and dominated mainstream media coverage of American politics. Blood in the Sand offers both an incisive analysis and a confrontational critique of America's recent international pursuits and its dominant political culture. Stephen Eric Bronner challenges the notion that everything changed in the aftermath of 9/11. He shows instead how a criminal act served to legitimize political manipulation and invigorate traditional nationalistic enthusiasms for militarism and imperial expansion. Employing his own experiences in the Middle East, Bronner acknowledges -- but refuses to overstate -- recent progressive developments in the region. He criticizes the neo-conservative penchant for unilateral military aggression and debunks the dubious notion of fostering democracy at gunpoint. While Bronner analyzes authoritarian repression, human rights violations, shrinking civil liberties, and severe socioeconomic inequalities, Blood in the Sand is neither a narrow political diatribe nor a futile exercise in anti-American negativism. The author honors America by condemning the betrayal of the nation's finest ideals by so many of those who, hypocritically or naively, invoke those ideals the most. Bronner sheds new light on those who insist on publicly waving the flag while privately subverting that for which it stands. Blood in the Sand sounds a clarion call for revitalizing the American polity and reshaping foreign policy along ~<br>

  Book Title: In Search of the Good Life-A Pedogogy for Troubled Times<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): DALLMAYR FRED<br>
  Abstract: The great German novelist Thomas Mann implored readers to resist the persistent and growing militarism of the mid-twentieth century. To whom should we turn for guidance during this current era of global violence, political corruption, economic inequality, and environmental degradation? For more than two millennia, the world's great thinkers have held that the ethically "good life" is the highest purpose of human existence. Renowned political philosopher Fred Dallmayr traces the development of this notion, finding surprising connections among Aristotelian ethics, Abrahamic and Eastern religious traditions, German idealism, and postindustrial social criticism. In Search of the Good Life does not offer a blueprint but rather invites readers on a cross-cultural quest. Along the way, the author discusses the teachings of Aristotle, Confucius, Nicolaus of Cusa, Leibniz, and Schiller, in addition invoking more recent writings of Gadamer and Ricoeur, as guideposts and sources of hope during our troubled times. Among contemporary themes Dallmayr discusses are the role of the classics in education, proper and improper ways of spreading democracy globally, the possibility of transnational citizenship, the problem of politicized evil, and the role of religion in our predominantly secular culture. Dallmayr restores the notion of the good life as a hallmark of personal conduct, civic virtue, and political engagement, and as the road map to enduring peace. In Search of the Good Life seeks to arouse complacent and dispirited citizens, guiding them out of the distractions of shallow amusements and perilous resentments in the direction of mutual learning and civic pedagogy -- a direction that will enable them to impose accountability on political leaders who stray from fundamental ethical standards.<br>

The contribution of Recuperación de la Memoría Historica, produced by the Human Rights Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, to our understanding of the impact of human rights violations, not just on individuals—damaging thereby both victims and perpetrators—but also on the fabric of community, will be examined. The “interruption” of<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

  Terror in One Country from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt8x8">The Furies</a><br>
  Author(s) Mayer Arno J.<br>
  Abstract: Revolution is a word-concept of multiple meanings. It evokes dialectically linked oppositions: light and darkness; rupture and continuity; disorder and order; liberation and oppression; salvation and damnation; hope and disillusion.¹ Precisely because it is Janus-faced, revolution is intrinsically tempestuous and savage. The Furies of revolution are fueled above all by the resistance of the forces and ideas opposed to it. This confrontation turns singularly fierce once it becomes clear that revolution entails and promises—or threatens—a thoroughly new beginning or foundation of polity and society. Hannah Arendt rightly insists that “revolutions are the only political events which confront us<br>

  Abstract: In recent intellectual discussions, the term

Like other hyphenated terms (post-modernism, post-metaphysics), the word exudes a certain irenic quality, in the sense that the harsh features of traditional conflicts—between faith and reason, religion and agnosticism—are presumably mitigated if not laid to rest. Unfortunately, this hope may be mistaken. Like many similar labels, the termpost-secularitypapers over disputes of interpretation that cannot be brushed aside. For some interpreters—clinging to the prefixpost—the term signals the end of a loathed or despised aspect of modernity, its lapse into irreligion<br>

Their irony gives them a generalized truth that is not always the case, while they remind us that we always face the certainty of despair and hope – often from the same source. Despair and hope are dialectical, for they can be opposing, and at times even complementary, parts of the same whole.

It is not the case, of course, that one of these types, even if one finds a pure representative for it, will guide us to a right interpretation of the Bible. For let us assume that the notion of a right interpretation of the Bible is itself not meaningless, but it is eschatological. The Christian community is gathered in

  Abstract: If consciousness is always enacted behaviorally in a world and neuronal connectivity instantiates consciousness but does not necessarily explain it, there is every reason to hope that we might come to understand both self-referential consciousness and the primary sentience it reorganizes by studying their likely points of evolutionary emergence. Any attempt, however, to infer forms and levels of consciousness in the activities and sensitive attunements of organisms simpler than ourselves runs immediately into one of the most fundamental debates of modern science.

Contrary to what some may think, charity is as essential to Jewish and Islamic life as it is to the Christian worldview. Between pure generosity and social redistribution, it deeply structures traditional societies by defining the respective roles of the rich and the poor, the use of money, and the legitimacy of the institutions that have taken up the task to collect and redistribute it.<br>

  Abstract: After Representation?explores one of the major issues in Holocaust studiesùthe intersection of memory and ethics in artistic expression, particularly within literature.As experts in the study of literature and culture, the scholars in this collection examine the shifting cultural contexts for Holocaust representation and reveal how writersùwhether they write as witnesses to the Holocaust or at an imaginative distance from the Nazi genocideùarticulate the shadowy borderline between fact and fiction, between event and expression, and between the condition of life endured in atrocity and the hope of a meaningful existence. What imaginative literature brings to the study of the Holocaust is an ability to test the limits of language and its conventions.After Representation?moves beyond the suspicion of representation and explores the changing meaning of the Holocaust for different generations, audiences, and contexts.<br>

  Abstract: We hope this book fosters work on political creativity, enlarging it from a residual explanation into a research program. In that spirit, we conclude with two ventures. First, we contrast notions of agency, order, and change with those of relationality, assemblage, and time to underscore what difference it makes to analyze political phenomena through the lens of political creativity rather than through a dualist framework in which structure and agency are kept apart. Although the pairing of two sets of concepts does not fully capture the rich and wide-ranging scholarship in this volume, we find it a useful heuristic to<br>

This dualistic dimension is all the more surprising given that Mudimbe advocates at the end of both

Given the ambiguity of the term and differences in interpretation, it can be translated into English in any number of ways. “Original enlightenment” is the most common, but this has a strong temporal connotation, implying some primordial or original state to be recovered or uncovered to fully realize enlightenment or buddhahood.<br>

In most cases revelations of the Cultural Revolution’s manifold persecutions and atrocities definitively cured the Maoists, as well as their “democratic” sympathizers, of their pro-Chinese leanings. One of the initial reasons they had turned to China was that the Soviet experiment in “really existing socialism” had been totally discredited.

Rational and social choice theories—like their economistic prototype—all hark back to a more or less Hobbesian view of the individual as a self-contained actor who is director of his or her own passions and interests, chief among which is, for Hobbes, the fear of death and the corresponding right to flee its approach.<br>

  Abstract: When violence is transformed into art—or even artful prose, be it reportorial or even analytic—its aestheticization is obvious. Art makes sense out of the senseless. The aestheticizing impulse, however, is less obvious in another creation of culture: the nation-state, that political work of art. The nation-state too promises to bring forth order out of disorder, mold form from that in which form is absent. But even though this order may be posited as a future hope, something to be achieved in the making, this hope is drenched in nostalgia, the imagined glory that once was. In South Asia<br>

  Abstract: Jane addams’s decision to become a volunteer also forced her to become an advocate of social justice. The girl from rural Illinois moved to Chicago with the hope of helping disadvantaged individuals. She quickly discovered that caring for individuals could go only so far. To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government. With the help of labor unions and social-reform organizations, she was able to institute juvenile-court laws, the first “mother’s pension” law, tenement-house regulations, an eight-hour workday law for women, factory-inspection laws, and workers’ compensation.<br>

  Abstract: While the plays that follow the tragedies and conclude Shakespeare’s career seem to belong to a different world from the tragedies, the differences do not eradicate some fundamental social continuities. The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope. Yet the spiritually ennobling process we witness in the romances is largely confined to the upper classes,<br>

  Abstract: Many reasonable consultants prescribe more debate as the best treatment for current symptoms of pathology in the humanities.¹ Debate therapy, however, in this case somewhat resembles the old fever cure. Rhetorical techniques such as caricature, imprecation, lament, and dire prophecy all win debate points in the humanities, but only while further raising our collective fever. The degree to which grandiose claims and spectacular accusations have in recent decades infected discussion of change in the humanities is itself a key symptom of a historical disorder that the method of debate can hardly hope to cure.<br>

  Book Title: I Am You-The Hermeneutics of Empathy in Western Literature, Theology and Art<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Important trends in contemporary intellectual life celebrate difference, divisiveness, and distinction. Speculative writing increasingly highlights "hermeneutic gaps" between human beings, their histories, and their hopes. In this book Karl Morrison identifies an alternative to this disruption. He explores for the first time the entire legacy of thought revolving around the challenging claim "I am you"--perhaps the most concise possible statement of bonding through empathy. Professor Morrison shows that the hope for thoroughgoing understanding and inclusion in another's world view is central to the West's moral/intellectual tradition. He maintains that the West may yet escape the fatal flaw of casting that hope in paradigms of sexual and aesthetic dominance--examples of empathetic participation inspired by hunger for power, as well as by love.<br>

  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>

  Abstract: This volume contends against a major lacuna in the story of eschatology in the twentieth century by offering a historical and comparative analysis of Edward Schillebeeckx’s prophetic eschatology and Johann Baptist Metz’s apocalyptic eschatology with the goal of identifying relative advantages and limitations of these divergent eschatological frameworks for rendering a Christian account of hope that prompts action in the public arena. Rodenborn provides a fresh angle on eschatologies of hope, bringing to the fore two Catholic theologians whose influences range from Vatican II to Latin American liberation theology. Hope in Action offers an innovative contribution to the theological account of the emergence of European political theologies and the role of eschatology as a practical and destabilizing theological category.<br>

What challenges and endangers Christian hope today? What is the hope that is in you?

As the road movie is dif-fi cult to identify in culturally specific terms, and is therefore always a genre in search of its identity, a French road movie is engaged in a constant negotiation of its own physical and conceptual boundaries. In fact, as I hope to have shown, analysing the ‘French road movie’ ultimately begs the question of its ‘French-ness’. If the road movie, to an extent, resists being<br>

  Theo Angelopoulos’ Unfinished Odyssey: The Other Sea from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzcz6">The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos</a><br>
  Author(s) Horton Andrew<br>
  Abstract: Theo Angelopoulos began his film career as a sombre political modernist. His early films offer biting critiques of Greece’s past and present, yet always with the distant hope that Greece’s future could be prosperous, and that the faults of its recent past could be remedied by a potentially glorious future. The earlier films do have melancholic endings, but in their melancholy the endings are signals or appeals for change: they are attempts to transform melancholy into hope. This outlook soon began to change, and the seeds of a more deep-seated pessimism were sown in Ο Μεγαλέξανδρος (
                  Megalexandros, 1980). Any sense<br>

  Book Title: Utopia in Performance-Finding Hope at the Theater<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Dolan Jill<br>
  Abstract: "Jill Dolan is the theatre's most astute critic, and this new book is perhaps her most important. Utopia in Performance argues with eloquence and insight how theatre makes a difference, and in the process demonstrates that scholarship matters, too. It is a book that readers will cherish and hold close as a personal favorite, and that scholars will cite for years to come."---David Román, University of Southern CaliforniaWhat is it about performance that draws people to sit and listen attentively in a theater, hoping to be moved and provoked, challenged and comforted? In
      Utopia in Performance, Jill Dolan traces the sense of visceral, emotional, and social connection that we experience at such times, connections that allow us to feel for a moment not what a better world might look like, but what it might feel like, and how that hopeful utopic sentiment might become motivation for social change.She traces these "utopian performatives" in a range of performances, including the solo performances of feminist artists Holly Hughes, Deb Margolin, and Peggy Shaw; multicharacter solo performances by Lily Tomlin, Danny Hoch, and Anna Deavere Smith; the slam poetry event Def Poetry Jam; The Laramie Project; Blanket, a performance by postmodern choreographer Ann Carlson; Metamorphoses by Mary Zimmerman; and Deborah Warner's production of Medea starring Fiona Shaw. While the book richly captures moments of "feeling utopia" found within specific performances, it also celebrates the broad potential that performance has to provide a forum for being human together; for feeling love, hope, and commonality in particular and historical (rather than universal and transcendent) ways.<br>

In this way, Benhabib associates the Utopian impulse with what Ernst Bloch calls our “principle of hope”—our ability and desire to imagine something other and better than our existing conditions.

He was also responding to the hope, or perhaps more accurately, the desire, to lift all of literary and cultural studies to the dignity of science, a desire that strongly animated French structuralism.

Despair, the passionate residue of Hegelian critique, also indicates fugitive opportunities for freedom and preserves the principle of hope against all hope.

  Abstract: In 2004 Herzog published notes he kept during the preproduction and filming of
                  Fitzcarraldobetween 1979 and 1982. EntitledConquest of the Useless(Die Eroberung des Nutzlosen), the book is emphatically not a production diary, but instead an impressionistic collection of fragments. In an entry dated July 29, 1980 (one quite representative of the collection’s style), he describes entering Belém do Pará with the costume designer Gisela Storch: “Into town with Gisela; because there is no sense of history, only a panting, sweating present, there is no hope of finding any historical costumes here.”¹ The director stylizes South America as<br>

  Book Title: Kafka for the Twenty-First Century-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Gross Ruth V.<br>
  Abstract: Franz Kafka's literary career began in the first decade of the twentieth century and produced some of the most fascinating and influential works in all of modern European literature. Now, a hundred years later, the concerns of a new century call for a look at the challenges facing Kafka scholarship in the decades ahead: What more can we hope to learn about the context in which Kafka wrote? How does understanding that context affect how we read his stories? What are the consequences of new critical editions that offer unprecedented access to Kafka's works in manuscript form? How does our view of Kafka change the priorities and fashions of literary scholarship? What elements in Kafka's fiction will find resonance in the historical context of a new millennium? How do we compose a coherent account of a personality with so many contradictory aspects? All these questions and more are addressed by the essays in this volume, written by a group of leading international Kafka scholars. Contributors: Peter Beicken, Iris Bruce, Jacob Burnett, Uta Degner, Doreen Densky, Katja Garloff, Rolf Goebel, Mark Harman, Robert Lemon, Roland Reuß, Ritchie Robertson, Walter Sokel, John Zilcosky, Saskia Ziolkowski.

  Abstract: German and Japanese attitudes toward the atrocities their nations committed during World War II are often contrasted as if they were completely different, but that is both too simple and somewhat misleading. Nevertheless, as I hope to show, one must start with the observation that the dichotomy has considerable merit. Then I will explain why, for the rest of Europe, recognition of what actually happened during that awful period has been quite similar to Japan’s evasiveness, at least until quite recently, and to a considerable degree, even now in parts of Eastern and Central Europe.

Abstract: On one common telling (rehearsed, in various ways, in the essays by Claudia Mills, Norman Daniels, Clark Wolf, and in the editors’ introduction), “political liberalism” falls uneasily between two extremes: one extreme is the hope of founding political community on a shared, comprehensive conception of the good; the other extreme is settling for a “mere” modus vivendi, where moral consensus gives way to the balancing of social and political forces. The sense of “philosophical loss” (Daniels’s phrase) that comes from abandoning the first extreme is powerfully represented in Friedman’s “melancholy conclusion” that Rawls has not shown that political liberalism is anything more than “one … political doctrine among many” (p. 31). Perhaps more surprising, however, is the number of contributors who are willing to put in “a good word for a modus vivendi” (the title of Bernard Dauenhauer’s essay), championing its ability to achieve stability (Mills), allow for experimentation (Dauenhauer), and be more inclusive (Scott Hershovitz). Wolf and Daniels, in what are arguably the volume’s two best essays, both defend Rawlsian justice “after politicization.”<br>

Author(s): Mialet Hélène<br>
Abstract: Put another way, Erving Goffman has shown that what constitutes and makes face‐to‐face interaction possible is precisely the immediacy of the corporeal copresence, which implies using signs or clues displayed by bodies in order to regulate the interaction. With Hawking, all the markers normally inscribed in a body (gestures, glances, positions, intonation, silences, sighs, or throat clearing) are missing. Instead, I have a more or less approving smile on a statuary body and a discourse fixed on a machine, punctuated by signs relating either to physical needs (legs, suction); or to wishes, feelings, or thoughts (I hope, I think, I am); or questions (“Why you?”); or orders (“Get Tom!”). Finally, an important element of an interaction (especially for turn taking) is mutual perception, which is made impossible in this context because of the mediation of the computer; we don’t look at each other, we both look instead at the computer.

Abstract: Defense of the Puritans against charges of political insubordination became particularly urgent as
      The History of the Puritansmoved into its longest and most difficult period: the reign of Charles I, culminating in civil war, the execution of the king, and the rule of Cromwell. Eighteenth‐century Dissenters were still living with the legal disabilities that followed from their assumed guilt for these events. And to legitimize their call for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, they needed to question the dominant historical picture of these events. The bishop of London, Gibson, had commented to Zachary Grey in 1736 with some complacency, “surely neither he nor his friends can hope to gain credit to their cause, by a History of the State of Religion, and particularly the conduct of the Puritans, from 1642 to 1660.”33Neal moves into this period with some circumspection, but this is precisely his unavoidable aim: to go some way toward justifying the conduct of the Puritans in the civil war and under Cromwell.<br>

Abstract: This recourse to anthropology allows, moreover, the second hypothesis finally to join up with the first, for it is true that, according to Kant, the three questions that sum up the whole system of philosophy (meaning metaphysics)—namely, “What can I know?” or, in other words,
         meta
            physica generalisreduced to the science of the first principles of human knowledge; followed by “What ought I to do?” which is to say, morals; and, finally, “What may I hope?” namely, religion itself—“could reckon all of this as anthropology, because the first three questions relate to the last one.” In short, the final question, “What is man?” would become the first question all over again.1Thus the metaphysical meaning of the term “philosophy of religion” joins up with its empirical acceptation, that of a simple “history of religions.” So, in front of revealed theology, there stands opposed only the double meaning of a singular anthropology.<br>

Abstract: Second, readers of Braudel’s
         Mediterranean,no matter how much of the book they actually have read, continue to be struck by the energy, engagement, and dedication of a fervent lover and committed convert. “I have passionately loved the Mediterranean, no doubt because I am a northerner like so many others in whose footsteps I have followed.”74This famous opening sentence in the preface to the first edition, dated May 1946, one year after VE Day and Braudel’s release from a German prisoner‐of‐war camp, resonates in Braudel’s remarks during a 1981 interview thirty‐five years later on his initial excitement at seeing the Mediterranean for the first time in October 1923 at the age of twenty‐one:
               North Africa freed Braudel, like so many earlier enchanted and enthralled romantic travelers, from his provincial complaisance. One can almost hear him chanting Goethe’s 1787 credo on finding one’s true self in the liberating southern sun: “I hardly recognize myself. I feel like a completely different person. Yesterday I thought: ‘Either you used to be mad, or you are now.’”It was for me such a surprise! I did not know the sea, I saw the Mediterranean, avowing that it is a present of the gods! Imagine someone like me who went down the Rhone Valley for the first time, who stopped at Marseille, who embarked on a boat and learned with pleasure that he had sea legs—it was just like that—and abruptly saw the arrival of Algiers on the horizon.… Algiers was the most beautiful city in France, after Paris, and a city itself very different, with, I would say, the beauty of its streets, the extraordinary beauty of its women.… It was hot, there was wine, fish, everything that one wants. For me, I began to live.

Abstract: While much of Frei’s work engages liberalism as its foil, his later work takes the shape of a mediating role between liberal and evangelical theology.
         55In so doing, he puts into effect the claim that the literal sense can include the range of concerns and perspectives across the theological spectrum of Christianity. As one recognizes that these diverse perspectives emerge from the literal sense—in other words, through a shared way of reading—one can recognize a unity within the differences of the church. The literal sense, clearly, is not only hospitable to Jesus Christ; at its best, Frei’s hope is that it enables Christians to be more hospitable to one another and to cultivate an alternative hospitality to its surrounding culture.56The plurality of interpretations in Midrash may thus model the hospitality created by the literal sense as a feature of what “reconstitutes” the Christian community in its distinctiveness and its unity.<br>

Abstract: I trust that what I have written here clarifies, in the course of the discussion, the relevance and significance of the seven characteristics of Don Browning’s style of theologizing. Following in his footsteps I hope to have made a contribution to the public theology he espouses—the first characteristic I mentioned at the beginning of this article. I trust that I have likewise shown my interest—the second characteristic—in the institutions determining people’s concrete daily lives, as well as influencing and coloring their norms, values, and religiosity. I have referred specifically to the institution of law, especially human rights law. The third characteristic is also clear: as Browning’s study of marriage and the family is conducted in a global, more especially an interreligious perspective, I have paid due attention to interreligious interaction and dialogue, which dominate not only politics and the mass media but also the conversations in our living rooms. Both of us are convinced that any public theology must be characterized by an empirical approach—the fourth characteristic. In his family project, Browning not only collaborates with social scientists but also incorporates their empirical research into the goal and content of his project. In this article, I, too, have used insights from political and social sciences, as well as empirical‐theological research, in order to relate the assumptions and principles of interreligious interaction and dialogue directly to empirical reality.<br>

Author(s): Todorova Maria<br>
Abstract: Trying to make sense of the square between the National Gallery/former palace and the mausoleum as a semiotic space, the cultural historian Dafina Dicheva laments the victory of destruction. She notes that, while the two buildings were indeed entangled in an epic metaphoric struggle, their physical presence side by side secured not only a synchronic but also a diachronic representation of the city's historical meanings, like a palimpsest. Transition periods always vacillate between rewriting and reassessment, but one would hope that any act would bring in some new meaning. The demolition of the mausoleum, according to Dicheva, left only a “desemioticized center and the debilitating power of the symbol of destruction, threatening in its insistence that anything can disappear.” In this context, she interprets the subsequent
         Bierfestin the square as a symbolic demolition in the wake of the physical one. It does not invert reality into the carnivalesque and thus integrate culture; instead, it disintegrates culture by transforming reality into carnival, where theBierfestis experienced as total reality. “Destruction does not allow the reconstruction of the social and cultural order. … On the contrary, it is a mirror inversion, which blocks the social and individual experience at the level of anticulture.”91<br>

Abstract: From this angle, the child may be viewed as contemporary morality’s greatest test. The work of the human sciences shows the diversity of ways in which children’s lives are disenfranchised but also deeply resilient. It can map the complex contours of problems like children’s persistent poverty or relations to mass media. But theological ethics must step in to help imagine how to make children a creative new response. To do to a child as you would have done to yourself is to respond to the profoundest possible depths of human otherness and marginality with a radically self‐transforming love and hope. It is to open oneself and one’s social world to reversing ingrained exclusions and oversimplifications through ever more other‐inclusive moral horizons. Responsibility for children in both families and society reveals the extent to which moral life is not just a fixed reality but also a transcending journey of creative response and renewal.<br>

Abstract: These considerations may also help us reflect on the nature of ethics as a disciplinary inquiry. Somewhat like artists, novelists, and even social and physical scientists, ethicists should function, at least in part, as investigators and disrupters of accepted wisdom, imaginers of provocative new moral possibilities, transformers of shared social and cultural worlds, and contributors toward creating more inclusive human meaning. They should do this in creative and fruitful conversation and tension with other disciplines, transforming and being transformed in relation to them.
         39Ethicists can contribute to society in both theoretical and practical ways by challenging ingrained moral ideologies, naming and exposing real social tensions, and innovating new possibilities for social and relational worlds and practices—that is, by engaging their world creatively. This task is already part of the ongoing interpretive conversation of ordinary moral culture. Ethicists may raise social dynamics to higher levels of intentional reflection in the hope of helping humanity better respond to its own primordial poetic capability for “making” this a better world.<br>

Such a culture was able to overcome the limits set by space and time and thus the need to delineate definite periods compelling the determination of a framework for action. In Simmel’s reckoning, all that was necessary, under the circumstances of this vision of a lived, endless present, was the will and capacity of the individual to act upon objective conditions. For those who possess the means to carry out this desire, the present will always appear as indistinguishable from the future; for others, the present can only mean uncertainty and offer hope for a better future. Moreover, it was the absence of periodicity demanded by capitalism that rendered invisible the coexistence of multiple temporalities in the present and their claims on both the past and future. Yet Simmel never explained the historical conditions that might account for the interruption of a concern for periodicity in the present; he had decided in advance to remain silent on the formation of capitalist society. Moreover, he was looking at the absence of periodicity from the perspective of consumption and consumers, not production, workers, and wages, which would have demanded instituting a framework determined by temporal markers. The sudden manifestation or awareness of the importance of periodicity would in fact reflect the punctual, cyclical crises produced by capitalist accumulation itself, as it would undermine the capacity to buy anything, anytime, especially for those whose future was always the day after. In this regard, the manifestation or awareness of the demand for periodicity at certain moments would signify a symptom of critical instabi~<br>

Abstract: Thus, in the figure of Enoch, Smith found a figure of covenantal hope earlier than Abraham, linked that hope directly to the coming of a messiah, and directed its fulfillment to an end times conditioned on human agency to call down the powers of heaven. The JST’s repetition of the covenant to Noah makes this more explicit. The KJV provides that the bow is a reminder of God’s everlasting covenant with “every living creature” to never again destroy the earth by flood. In contrast, the JST Noah is told the bow is a sign of the covenant with Enoch “that, when men should keep all my commandments, Zion should again come on the earth.”
         86Moreover, as with Enoch himself, those who would realize the promise of the covenant must contribute to its realization by obtaining heavenly powers on a temporal plane. They must “embrace the truth and look upward.” When they do “then shall Zion look downward … [and] shall come down out of heaven and possess the earth, and shall have place till the end come.” These are the terms of “the everlasting covenant” that effects the reconstitution of the bond with the sacred and holds the key to the end of evil. Though this promise of a latter‐day Zion that would receive Enoch’s Zion, as well as partake of its theurgic powers, obtains from the past, as narrativized by Smith, it constitutes a sacred history that oriented the Latter‐day Saints to a particular future. It provided an identity that carried them from New York to the Ohio frontier, through extermination orders in Missouri to exile from Illinois, and finally to the Rocky Mountains, building city after city in hope of Zion.87<br>

Abstract: Given the paucity of sources, both textual and extratextual, for the history of early Vedānta, to say nothing of that of early Sāṃkhya, the proposed reading of the
      Brahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyain terms of two defining apologetic moments can claim to be little more than a hypothesis. Nevertheless, it does carry some important interpretive benefits. As I hope to show in the second part of this essay, it sheds fresh critical light on the long‐standing and controversial question of whether Śaṅkara taught that the phenomenal world is unreal. Moreover, this reading of theBhāṣyaas double voiced, in emphasizing the creative tension between the personal and impersonal aspects of brahman, suggests a more dynamic conception of brahman than the abstract and static Absolute typically associated with the Śaṅkara tradition.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Traditional narratology well knows the implacable nature of plot's marital vanishing point. But it is narratography that can take up with a story where narratology and sometimes even where plot leaves off. Granted, the fantasy phase of this essay's experiment has, in its extremity, respected no proper bounds. But in just this way I hope it might appear exemplary, at least in this following sense: to remind us that a narrative's most urgent, disturbing, even insurgent meanings often come through between the lines of plot, subliminal, figured rather than denoted. Narratology knows all too well the stranglehold and exclusions of the marriage story. Narratography would experience them from the ground up, patrolling the fold between a book's rhetoric and its actual writing.<br>

Abstract: Some people find this situation terrifying and retreat into strident humanistic or fanatic religious outlooks centered on man or God. They hope to control the whirl of the age through the reduction of complexity to a single center or form of knowledge. Others see the polycontextual space of social life backing a free play of meaning and the destruction of inherited binary oppositions that are encrusted in traditional thought forms.
         29Yet for some thinkers, myself included, our global, polycontextual condition invigorates a search for more complex and yet also coherent accounts of knowledge. Knowledge is multidimensional, I contend, and is constituted by the interaction among codes and frames rather than being organized through a “center” or a “hierarchy,” whether that center is the man of humanism, the god of religion, or the deconstruction of those binaries. Ironically, it seems that both contemporary religionists and strident humanists want to push back on the complexity of contemporary societies and champion simpler modes of thought and yet in doing so risk a reduction and not a gain in understanding.<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Abstract: According to Wachter and Burnet, then, Kabbalist theology held out the hope that the estranging activity of transcendence that gave rise to the material and spiritual worlds would one day be reversed. In a word, the divinity that had once been hidden would return to and in a resacralized world. Moreover, this move would entail the retreat of the human person, as opposed to the withdrawal of the divine that precipitated creation. It is noteworthy that Spinoza's work, which both Wachter and Leibniz associated with the Kabbalah, followed such a course (Sutcliffe, 162–64). Their pronouncements corroborate the position staked out in this essay: alongside an awareness of the expanding distance between God and creation there was an opposing tendency to dissolve the boundaries between them.<br>

Likewise, Tillich claims that any “form of grace,” any immanent appearance of prophetic critique, will always anticipate a future.43It will always rightly hold open the hope of a future, a utopia perhaps, or the fulfilled reign of God.<br>

Abstract: IN 1978, the esteemed scholar G. S. Rousseau surveyed the state of the field of literature and science in the pages of
         Isis. As he noted, the work of Marjorie Hope Nicholson inspired a generation of scholars during the 1950s to establish a new Literature and Science division within the Modern Language Association of America (MLA). The story Rousseau tells is largely one of the impact of science—and of history of science—on the study of literature by literary and intellectual historians. While carefully taking account of the diverse approaches informing the practice of literature and science through the late 1970s, Rousseau observed with concern just how vulnerable to methodological critiques were studies of the “influence” of science on literature that then dominated the field. Ultimately, his essay strikes a pessimistic note. Specifically, Rousseau voiced concern that “structuralism” would undermine any question of the “validity of literature and science as a field”; “as proof,” he cited the “sharp plunge” in the number of “members of the [MLA] division” of Literature and Science.1The future did not look bright for this field.<br>

Abstract: This ambivalent view of temporality also explains why Ricoeur all of a sudden talks about the future, “the time of hope” (in the Pauline sense of stretching forward),
      
            as resulting from a14
         distentio animithat is no longer “‘distend[ing]' itself as it [is] ‘engag[ing]' itself,”
            no longer part of that which is going to stay. As a result, this future appears disconnected from its present and, having turned into future15
         tout court, ceases to be a present of the future, apraesens futuri. Ultimately, for Ricoeur, the negativity of eternity's presence versus time prevails, favoring a view of thedistentio animithat, unlike the utopian and supratemporal conversations and narrations within vision, conversion, and gift, opens up the possibility of giving shape to what he sees as the preconditions of time and narrative that owe more to the temporality of theregio dissimilitudinisthan to the gift of destiny.<br>

Abstract: My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
            Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey(Stanford, Calif., 2004). I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the beauty of other human beingsistheir depth, the depth of that invisible perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific knowledge—such as the delightful fact, inAdaptation, about Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first place.<br>

But Mephistopheles does not really perform conjuration for the clowns—he not only declines to feign to enter into their service but even translates them into an ape and a dog—because Rafe and Robin are not really in danger of being damned, having no real desire to commit themselves to the devil.<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: In addition to developing a theological anthropology, Regan lays the groundwork for a human rights praxis of “just memory,” drawing on the work of Paul Ricoeur. Situating human rights discourse between the memory of suffering and the hope for a better future, Regan develops an ethics toward just memory, which includes allowing individuals to face the scars and wounds of memory in order to work through the past (101), enabling the pragmatic use of memory throughout a community through construction of narrative (101–2), and articulating an ethical-political duty of remembrance for purposes of preventing destructive tendencies, allowing the possibility of forgiveness, and retaining a heritage of victimization to counter the historical tendency to celebrate victors (102). Regan discusses the report of human rights violations and their individual and societal impacts, produced by the Office of the Catholic Archdiocese of Guatemala, as an example of how such an ethic can be put into practice.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Vincent Crapanzano adopts an aphoristic/interrogative style. He first asks whether it is possible to distinguish an anthropology of morality from the morality of anthropology. Insofar as we have not had a coherent anthropology of morality, I hope not—but I wonder if this implies a moral dimension of anthropology that goes beyond professional ethics. His second intervention suggests I fail to recognize that moral anthropology has often deflected ethnographic study of morality, though the newer studies to which I call attention do incorporate an ethnographic approach. He also wonders whether insistence by American anthropologists on egalitarian relationships in the field is an imposition of American values; one could extend this query to the well-intentioned but ironically nonegalitarian appropriation in the ethnographic aim of giving voice to the oppressed indigenous. Crapanzano’s third aphoristic query raises the relation among descriptive, normative, and universal morality while stopping short of asking how the rhetoric of the universal to which he refers might be related to the distinction between cultural and moral relativity. His fourth reflection is framed in terms of two distinctions (between political and moral, and between psychological and moral), but especially in the American society to which he refers it might be just as fruitful to put moral, political, and psychological idioms and attributions into a triangular relationship. Aphorism five is an injunction to consider the meta-moral, and I take this to mean both how morality is defined and where it fits into social discourse and ethnographic practice.<br>

Abstract: As Jill Robbins demonstrates in her admirable study of Levinas and literature, it is virtually impossible to cull a coherent theory of literary criticism from Levinas’s thought and practice. By turning to his Talmudic writings, I oversimplify the situation and draw what might be unpardonable parallels. Nevertheless, I hope that the suggestiveness of the maneuver will make up for its recklessness. See Jill Robbins,

Article Title: Historicizing Religion: Varro’s<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: The concept of “religions” itself is one important and problematic consequence of the historical approach sketched above. The units of description might be self-evident from an emic point of view, the internal discourse of a group, frequently adopted by political commentators and journalists, who all might share an interest in clear-cut boundaries, in exclusion of heretics or the inclusion of wavering allies. Varro’s history of religion as embedded in his systematic account of religious practices and beliefs at Rome, in Italy, and in the wider Mediterranean invites one to develop alternative concepts. “Roman religion,” as I hope to have shown, is not without alternatives. The direct coupling of religious identity and historiography of religion (familiar from a tradition of “national history”) in what we might term “confessional historiography” can be countered through the development of alternative and more complex histories of religion.
      
               Of course, every group is entitled to construe itself as the legitimate keeper of a tradition, but it should be the task of scientific history of religion to highlight the selections and exclusions of positions and people implied in such emic histories. Reflecting on the biases and concealments of traditional narratives and historiography of religions and on the history of its analytical and descriptive terms is vital for any history of religion in the twenty-first century.73<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Nietzsche reproached Paul for shifting “the center of gravity of the entire existence beyond this existence—into the lie of the ‘resurrected’ Jesus.”
            
                  Badiou, on the contrary, sees in the resurrection “that on the basis of which life’s center of gravity comes to reside in life, whereas previously, being situated in the Law, it organized life’s subsumption by death.” Resurrection establishes the unconditional point of interruption, the point of discontinuing death’s rule and, hence, allowing life to take revenge on death here and now, enabling the subject to “live affirmatively, according to the spirit, rather than negatively, according to the flesh, which is the thought of death.”62
               
                  This usage of the categories of “life” and “death” corresponds to the hope that humanity can now vanquish death and affirm life in the contingent sense, rather than by trusting in a literal or physical promise of resurrection: death and life are paths that can be chosen here and now, there is no need to transpose them into the transcendent dimension. In order for ontology to be ultimately freed from ontotheological trappings Badiou adopts “the thesis of the infinity of being” itself.63
               
                  Since infinity joins immanence and breaks with transcendence, no resort to other-worldliness is required: infinite multiplicity is simply and immanently what there is. As Badiou’s interpreter Adam Miller points out, against such a background the notion of “immanent grace” does not dissolve into paradox and contradiction but is actually thinkable.64

Publisher: Blackwell Publishing<br>
Issue: i273563<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Yerushalmi Howard L.<br>
Abstract: Rather than viewing Freud as a presumptuous Viennese physician who late in life attempted to "apply" some of his provocative psychological speculations to various social phenomena, this essay argues that from first to last, Freud was a social theorist. Indeed, what drew Freud to the study of biology and medicine was precisely the hope of addressing scientifically the most fundamental cultural problems: the nature of man and his culture; the origins of religion, morality, and tradition and the nature of their extraordinary power; the sources of social order and disorder; the direction of contemporary cultural development; and, finally, the problem of how to live in a disenchanted and psychologically impoverished world. Reading Freud in this manner moves his "cultural" texts from the periphery to the center of his work and makes possible an appreciation of the more complex, coherent, and illuminating social theory that lies at its heart.<br>

Abstract: Even though Martin Luther King, Jr. constantly cited the Bible, no one has seriously examined his rhetoric as biblical hermeneutic. Here I argue that in "I Have a Dream," King explodes closed memories of the Exodus by reconceptualizing a hermeneutic of (Second) Isaiah as he interprets African-Americans' experience of oppression and exile in Babylon/America and their hope for a new Exodus. Drawing on African-American political rhetoric, King spotlights biblical writers' dialogue with each other and extends the arc of biblical narrative into the present. He also anticipates certain forms of liberation theology of the 1970s and beyond.<br>

Issue: i23250013<br>

Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Author(s): SCOTT-BAUMANN ALISON<br>
Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that a religious perspective on South African writing (the term is defined as including any cultural artefact, spoken or written, which uses language(s) as its main means of communication) is both fruitful and long overdue. The essay traces, or outlines, the general situation and lists some areas in which religious concerns, such as transformation, suffering and hope, poverty and marginality, can contribute to debates on South African writing. Some of these are further discussed.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917895<br>
Date: 9 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Mills Kevin<br>
Abstract: This paper sets out to question contemporary notions of language which employ metaphors of imprisonment or confinement to describe the alleged failure of the word to connect with the world. Valentine Cunningham's recent book. In the Reading Gaol, is confronted with Helen Keller's experience of being excluded from language (as described in her autobiography), in order to argue that the issue of hermeneutic freedom needs to be rethought. This involves raising certain doubts about freedom—doubts identified by means of a consideration of the cases of New Testament prisoners: Peter, John, Paul and Silas. I conclude that freedom, confronted by doubt (evident in ascetical gestures) is produced by a hermeneutics of hope. Hope, constituted by its own rivenness, both allows and limits the effects of hermeneutical suspicion. The imprisoning effect ascribed to language can then be seen as a failure with regard to hope.<br>

Article Title: "Money is the Filial Child. But, at the same time, it is also the Enemy!": Korean Shamanic Rituals for Luck and Fortune<br>
Publisher: Institute for the Study of Religion<br>
Issue: i23942764<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Park Jun Hwan<br>
Abstract: In the world of Korean shamanism, there is a particular god, called taegam, which is allegedly famous for its love of money and its abundance of greed for material wealth. During the shamanic ritual of chaesu-kut, the rites for good fortune and luck, this god is popularly worshipped as the Deity of Wealth and is typically symbolized by money placed all over its face and spirit costumes. Nonetheless, as money has the two sides of heads and tails, taegam also has two very different faces—so-taegam and taegam. This article explores the ambiguity of the two taegam gods, focusing on the symbolic action of money-offerings and how its meaning is taken from the perspective of the ritual actors, in the hope of shedding light on the place of Korea's traditional popular religion of shamanism in today's transformed urban landscape. By discussing the semantics of "money is the filial child" (a remark made by so-taegam) and "money is the enemy" (as remarked by taegam), statements I often heard during my fieldwork in Seoul, I suggest that the ambivalent symbolic nature of taegam should be seen as an indispensible vehicle for understanding ritual life, as well as everyday life, of urban Korean people since it is closely related to both normative orientations and the contradictory aspects of the material culture of contemporary urbanites inhabiting the borderless, globalized, and fluctuating modern capitalist market. This conclusion is reached partly with reference to existing sociological theories of money and anthropological inquiries into the ambivalent aspects of taegam.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i24439058<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
Abstract: This article explores the crisis of narrative in contemporary culture. It begins by examining the challenge represented by the mass media for the continuing art of storytelling. Taking up Walter Benjamin's warning that we are moving from an age of narrative experience to an age of instant information, it analyses the implications of the post-modern 'cult of simulation' for education, historiography and ethics. The paper concludes by advocating a critical hermeneutic approach as the most apt response to this contemporary dilemma. Only by means of such hermeneutic retrieval, inspired by the work of Ricoeur and Gadamer, can we avoid the current reduction of temporal experience to a 'depthless present' without past or future, thereby reaffirming the crucial narrative dimensions of historical memory and hope.<br>

March 2004. Here I draw on an old interest: see Hiltebeitel, Ritual of Battle,
254-66; "Brothers, Friends, and Charioteers: Parallel Episodes in the Irish and
Indian Epics," ed. Edgar C. Polom, Homage to Georges Dumézil: Journal of Indo-
European Studies Monograph, No. 3 (1982): 85-112; "The Two Krsnas on One
Chariot: Upanisadic Imagery and Epic Mythology," History of Religions 24
(1984): 1-26. As I hope to show in Mapping, friendship relates to a whole cluster
of themes that can be tied together in and around Kama, while friendship in rela-
tion to enmity is the epic ground of dvesa bhakti, "devotion by hatred," for which
the above-mentioned Sisupäla - whom Fitzgerald would like to excise from the
Mbh - is the most prominent Mbh example and, like Karna and Arjuna, a son of
one of Krsna's paternal aunts; see Georges Dumézil, Mythe et épopée, 2: Types
épiques indo-européens: un héros, un sorcier, un roi (Paris: Éditions Gallimard,
1971), 63, 65-66.<br>

Abstract: The transcendental critique of theoretical thought as it was developed by Herman
Dooyeweerd can be seen as a particularization of a général reflective critique of experience.
This perspective implies that theoretical thought and everyday experience do not stand
opposite each other as 'Gegenstand-relation' versus 'subject-object relation', as in
Dooyeweerd. I hope to show elsewhere the structural affinity of these two.<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: La métaphore kantienne du « grand jeu de la vie », dont nous sommes tous partie prenante en tant que nous sommes citoyens du monde, obligés d'affronter les quatre questions fondamentales : « Que puis-je savoir? Que dois-je faire? Que m'est-il permis d'espérer? » et : « Qu'est-ce que l'homme? » qui, d'après Kant, récapitulent les grands intérêts de la raison humaine dans une optique cosmopolitique, cette métaphore nous offre un excellent fil conducteur pour analyser les rapports complexes entre religion et raison philosophique. Contrairement à ce que prétend la vulgate contemporaine, nous n'avons pas encore fini d'explorer la « fonction méta » en ses quatre dimensions essentielles de la « trans-ascendance », de la « trans-descendance », de la « trans-passibilité » et de la « trans-possibilité » qui, même si elles trouvent une expression différente dans le champ religieux et dans le champ de la réflexion philosophique, donnent infiniment à penser à la religion comme à la philosophie. Kant's metaphor of the "big game of life", to which all humans partake insofar as they are citizens of the world confronted with the four fundamental questions: "What can I know?, What ought I do?, What may I hope for?" and, last but not least: "What is man?", which according to Kant summarize the major interests of Human reason in a cosmo-political perspective, offers an excellent thread for analyzing the complex relationships between Religion and Philosophy. As opposed to what many contemporary thinkers pretend, we have not yet finished pondering the "metafunction" in its fourfold dimensions: "trans-ascendance", "transdescendance", "trans-passibility" and "trans-possibility" which, although they find a different expressions in the religious field and in the field of philosophical thought, invites to rethink both religion and philosophy.

Abstract: Afrikaans writers have often found themselves in a marginal position. During the time of apartheid, they vehemently criticised racial discrimination, thus dissociating themselves from the centre of power. After the demise of apartheid, Afrikaans writers were marginalised in a different way, when the Afrikaans language lost its previous dominant position and truly became a minority language. They were then forced to reexamine their past and reinterpret their present. In this article, recent Afrikaans writers' radical reinvention of the ideological significance of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) is discussed. One novel about the War, Ingrid Winterbach's Niggie ("Cousin") is analysed in detail as an example of the search for meaning from a marginal position. The novel has a special relevance for Afrikaners in their painful adaptation to a new South Africa, but it is also linked to general themes like trauma, despair and hope.<br>

Abstract: Abrams puts it, "The great Romantic works were not written at the height of revo-
lutionary hope but out of the experience of partial or total disenchantment with the revolution-
ary promise. The striking fact is that a number of these works nonetheless retain, but translate
into a different dimension of experience, the design, the ideas, and the imagery of the callower
works their authors had composed in a mood of millennial excitement" {Natural Supernaturalism,
p. 335).<br>

Issue: i323404<br>

Author(s): Carroll Linda L.<br>
Abstract: From the beginning of his career, sixteenth-century playwright Angelo Beolco (also known as Ruzante, the name of the peasant character he created and played) declared his anguish at the worsening of the peasants' economic and political position. Illegitimate child of the authoritarian patriarch of a minor noble family beginning its decline and (probably) a household servant likely of peasant origin, he appears to have identified with the peasants' exclusion from governing institutions and the blocking of their access to wealth. At first, the Evangelical reform movement, with its emphasis on justice for the poor, appealed to him as an effective instrument for persuading the powerful to correct the situation. That hope having proved illusory, Beolco passed through a rapid evolution of beliefs that calls into question Lucien Febvre's theory of the parameters of religious experience in the Renaissance. The present article explores this evolution.<br>

Abstract: One of the most interesting potential contributions of culture research lies at the intersection of the study of culture and the study of power. At this intersection lies a process of communication in which interested actors present particular understandings of the world in the hope of creating or sustaining preferred patterns of social relations. In this processes, groups and individuals struggle to create and disseminate cultural forms that support preferred patterns of power and dominance. This article presents a methodology, critical hermeneutics, useful in analyzing these attempts. To underscore the usefulness of the approach, we applied the method to a corporation's image advertising campaign, a set of texts intended to restructure the corporation's image and reframe a set of issues in a way favorable to it.<br>

Abstract: Starting by the distinction made by Henrique Cláudio de Lima Vaz between the democratic ideal and real democracy, and to assume that we will only be able to build a true democratic community if we act within that same community as authentic persons, we defend in this article that being a person is constituted as a call to hope. We will divide the article into three parts. In the first part, we will explain in what sense the personalism is constituted as an option for hope. Then we indicate what it means to be a person for Lima Vaz. Finally, we show how we can become a person and what are the difficulties to this accomplishment. Only when we exist as authentical people we will be able to establish the right relationship between the democratic ideal and real democracy.<br>

Abstract: I again send the reader to the unpublished dissertation of Janet Altman,
which attempts "to isolate those literary phenomena which are particular
to or present in unique ways in the letter form" (p. 7). I would hope that
my own study, biased as it is toward a fuller understanding of the
development of narrative fiction in general, would complement Profes-
sor Altman's. My own approach seeks less to discover what is unique
about epistolary fiction than to isolate and understand its narrative con-
formity. Nonetheless, our analyses intersect in important ways.<br>

Abstract: Mass death resulting from war, starvation, and disease as well as the vicissitudes of extreme poverty and enforced sexual servitude are recognizably pandemic ills of the contemporary world. In light of their magnitude, are repentance, regret for the harms inflicted upon others or oneself, and forgiveness, proferring the erasure of the guilt of those who have inflicted these harms, rendered nugatory? Jacques Derrida claims that forgiveness is intrinsically rather than circumstantially or historically impossible. Forgiveness, trapped in a paradox, is possible only if there is such a thing as the unforgivable. "Thus, forgiveness, if there is such a thing," can only exist as exempt from the law of the possible. Does this claim not open the way for hopelessness and despair? More troubling for Derrida is his concession that forgiveness may be necessary in the realm of the political and juridical. If so, is not the purity of the impossibility of forgiveness so crucial for him, contaminated? In pointing to some of the difficulties in Derrida's position, I shall appeal to Vladimir Jankelevitch's distinction between the unforgivable and the inexcusable. I shall also consider the significance of repentance in the theological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Max Scheler. Forgiveness, I conclude, is vacuous without expiation, a position that can be helpfully understood in the context of Judaism's analysis of purification and acquittal in the Day of Atonement liturgy. I argue that what disappears is Derrida's assurance of the impossibility of forgiveness, a disappearance that allows for hope.<br>

Article Title:  The Power of the Impure: Transgression, Violence and Secrecy in Bengali Śākta Tantra and Modern Western Magic <br>
Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i364859<br>
Date: 1 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Shepherd Hugh B.<br>
Abstract: Since their first encounter with the complex body of texts and traditions called "Tantras," Western scholars have been simultaneously repulsed and horrified, yet also tantalized and titillated by the deliberate use of normally impure and defiling substances in Tantric practice. Yet, with a few exceptions, they have made little headway in interpreting the deeper religious and social role of impurity, either in Tantric ritual or in the history of religions generally. This paper compares the role of ritual impurity and transgression in two very different traditions, widely separated both historically and geographically: the Śākta school of Tantra in Bengal (focusing on the 16th century brāhmaṇ, Kṛṣṇānanda Āgamavāgīśa) and modern Western magic (focusing on Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis). Specifically, I look closely at the manipulation of impure bodily substances-such as blood, semen and vaginal fluids-in sexual rituals and animal sacrifice. By playing off of these two examples in a kind of metaphoric juxtaposition, I hope to shed some new light on the role of impurity, transgression and secrecy in both cases and also in the comparative study of religion as a whole. Adapting some insights from Georges Bataille and Michel Foucault, I argue that the ritual use of impurity has much larger social and political implications, as a means of harnessing the tremendous power that flows through the physical universe, the human body and the social body alike.<br>

Article Title: The Economy of the Gift: Paul Ricoeur's Significance for Theological Ethics<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000789<br>
Date: 7 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's understanding of the relations of faith, love, and hope suggests a unique approach to theological ethics, one that holds fresh promise for bringing together considerations of the good (teleology) and the right (deontology) around the notion of an "economy of the gift." The economy of the gift articulates Ricoeur's distinctively dialectical understanding of the relation of the human and the divine, and the resulting dialectical moral relation of the self and the other. Despite our fallen condition, Ricoeur suggests, we are called by the divine to embrace the radical possibility of the reconciliation of human goods under the requirement of accountability to human diversity and otherness.<br>

Article Title: Hermeneutics and Ethics: The Example of Reinhold Niebuhr<br>
Publisher: Religious Ethics, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40000905<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): McCann Dennis P.<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the imaginative foundations of ethics, not by presenting a theory about the moral imagination, but by reconstructing the hermeneutic strategy underlying Reinhold Niebuhr's proposal for "an independent Christian ethic." The thesis is that Niebuhr's ethic cannot adequately be evaluated without careful attention to his hermeneutics, what he described as "the mythical method of interpretation." This point is argued first, by reconstructing Niebuhr's hermeneutics; second, by showing how his hermeneutics determines the strategy of his ethics; and third, by using this focus to clarify certain issues separating Niebuhr and some of his recent critics, specifically, William Frankena's criticism of his metaethics, Gene Outka's objections to his normative ethic of love as self-sacrifice; and John Howard Yoder's rejection of the strategy of his Christian realism as a whole. The essay is presented in the hope that Niebuhr's example will encourage American religious ethicists to explore the relationship between hermeneutics and ethics with greater intellectual sympathy and theoretical sophistication. The example of Niebuhr's "independent Christian ethic" is commended as one attempt to map the formal and substantive ways in which religious visions help shape our dispositions and moral choices.<br>

Issue: i40014414<br>

Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Renaud Michel<br>
Abstract: Este estudo dedica-se à teoria da verdade tal como se apresenta nas obras de Ricoeur entre 1947 e 1960. Procura-se sublinhar o vaivém entre uma compreensão ontológica da verdade, marcada antes de mais pelo pensamento de Karl Jaspers (1947), e uma compreensão fenomenológica da verdade centrada na teoria do juízo (1960). Contudo a análise da tensão entre a unidade do verdadeiro e a multiplicidade das filosofias permite elaborar o conceito de verdade como comunicação e de verdade como objecto de esperança. Procura-se então mostrar o fundamento desta esperança bem como a dimensão pela qual ela ultrapassa o universo da filsosofia. A conclusão sublinha que os desenvolvimentos ulteriores de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sobre a hermenêutica do símbolo, da metáfora e da narrativa ganham em serem relidos no horizonte das tensões do problema da verdade. /// Cette étude est consacrée à la théorie de la vérité telle qu'elle se présente dans l'oeuvre de Ricoeur entre 1947 et 1960. On cherche à souligner le va-et-vient entre une compréhension ontologique de la vérité initielement influencée par la pensée de Karl Jaspers 1947, et une compréhension phénoménologique de la vérité centrée sur la théorie du jugement (1960). L'analyse de la tension entre l'unité du vrai et la multiplicité des philosophies débouche cependant sur le concept de vérité comme communication et comme object d'espérence. On cherche alors à montrer le fondement de cette espérance ainsi que la dimension par laquelle elle dépasse l'univers de la philosophie. La conclusion souligne que les développements ultérieurs de Ricoeur (1960-1989) sur l'herméneutique du symbole, de la métaphore et du récit ont tout à gagner à être replacés et relus à l'horizon des tensions du problème de la vérité. /// This study pays special attention to the theory of truth elaborated in Ricoeur's work from 1947 to 1960.

Abstract: É objectivo do presente estudo introduzir a uma reinterpretação das visões imagéticas. simbólicas e dramáticas que fascinam. apaixonam e obcecam a alma do pregador como indicadores proféticos do iminente advento da plenitude teândrico-cósmica e escatológica que designou como Quinto Império ou Reino de Cristo na terra consumado. A partir do levantamento dos seus fundamentos teológico-filosóficos, problematizando-os a partir do que o próprio autor designou como "tentações da esperança, visamos assim averiguar até que ponto na objectivação histórico-institucional e terrena da escatologia quinto-imperial se não projecta e refracta. inconsciente de si mesma. uma experiência mais autêntica da alma, em seu místico e visionário confronto com a simbologia do Infinito e da Totalidade. /// This essay aims to be an introduction to a reinterpretation of the imagetic visions, both symbolic and dramatic, that fascinate, impassionate and obsess the preacher's soul as prophetic signs of the impending coming of the theandric-cosmic and eschatological fulness that he called the Fifth Empire or Christ's Kingdom inaugurated on earth. On the basis of its theologic-philosophical foundations, which he questioned based upon what the author himself called "hope temptations", we aim to investigate to what extent a more authentic experience of the soul, in its mystic and visionary confrontation with the symbology of the Infinit and of the Totality, is projected and refracted, unconscious of itself, on the historic-institutional and worldly objectitication of the eschatology of the Fifth Empire.<br>

Abstract: A quebra no que se refere às certezas da fé, a ênfase da própria experiência e os horrores do século XX levaram ao surgimento de uma vaga de (anti-)teodiceias. Aos ataques por parte do ateísmo correspondem do lado dos teólogos ou um certo resentimento em relação a Deus ou a sua desculpa mediante um pôr-em-questão da sua omnipotência. Surgiram desta forma propostas de carácter ora dualistico ora monístico que fizeram com que a resposta clássica ao problema tivesse progressivamente ficado quase reduzida ao âmbito do ininteligível (veja-se o caso da incompreensão das teses ontológicas referentes ao carácter deficitário do mal). Foi sobretudo em confronto com a tonalidade afectiva desta discussão que surgiu a "free-will-defense" da racionalidade, muito embora a questão seja aqui a de saber até que ponto não têve ela por isso de pagar um preço demasiado alto. Em referência à dupla questão de Boécio na obra "Consolação da Filosofia", o autor do presente artigo defende, por um lado, a não solubilidade do problema da teodiceia: "Si Deus est, unde mala?" - Néscio! Por outro lado, no entanto, o autor constata também que a reflexão sobre a experiência de si não só justifica, como até exige, uma abertura à esperança da fé: "Si vero Deus non est, unde bona?" Seio quod nonl Facto é que desta forma, diz o autor, nos confrontamos com a realidade do bem seja isso a propósito da exigência moral que experimentamos ou do protesto que levantamos contra a realidade do mal. Ora é esta auto-revelação do poder da realidade do santo e do bem que não só nos permite, mas também de nós exige a Esperança da sua manifestação final. /// Breakdown in what concerns faith certainties, emphasis on experience of the self, and the horrors of the XX century led to a wave of (anti)-theodicies.

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical. The paradox ~<br>

Abstract: As alusões implícitas e as referências explícitas ao pensamento de Søren Kierkegaard pontuam toda a obra de Jacques Ellul. Com efeito, segundo o autor do artigo, sempre que trata de temas como a Bíblia, a fé, a esperança, o amor, a oração, a liberdade, a política, a técnica, a não-conformidade ao mundo, ou o sofrimento, Jacques Ellul recorre insistentemente a Kierkegaard em ordem a construir o seu próprio pensamento. Nesse sentido, o artigo pretende mostrar os modos de fidelidade, de retoma e de reinterpretação de uma na outra obra de modo a, de algum modo, também poder esclarecer o significado da expressão "ser kierkegaardiano". /// Implicit allusions and explicit references to Søren Kierkegaard's thought punctuate the entire work of Jacques Ellul. Especially when dealing with topics like the Bible, faith, hope, love, prayer, freedom, politics, technology, nonconformity to the world, or suffering, Ellul calls frequently on Kierkegaard in order to build his own thought. The article shows the different modes of fidelity, resumption and reinterpretation of a work into the other, so that at the end it also clarifies what it means to be kierkegaardian.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel".

Abstract: Pre-colonial histories in Southeast Asia are generally dependent on a very limited number of written sources. Most information originates from the elites among dominant ethnic groups or Westerners. These centralized histories are frequently uncritically treated as the 'truth.' This is especially true in countries like Laos, where historical documents are rare. But different versions of widely accepted histories also exist, and these often-contested histories remain prominent in the minds of people from different ethnic groups. This paper demonstrates the contested nature of history in Laos and the importance of ethnicity in social memory, using a well-known historical event that occurred in southern Laos— the Ay Sa Rebellion of the early nineteenth century. Lao, Siamese, and Western versions of the history of this rebellion are reviewed, followed by oral histories obtained from ethnic Brao people who maintain memories of the events that transpired. I hope to demonstrate the importance of considering ethnicity in relation to histories, and to encourage others to investigate alternative versions of histories in Laos.<br>

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Author(s): PURI MICHAEL J.<br>
Abstract: When conceived as the presence of the past, memory can be said to pervade the music of Maurice Ravel. The number and range of these acts of musical memory -including illeces modelled on the medieval ballade, the Renaissance chanson, the Baroque tombeau, the Classical sonatine and the Romantic poème, among others -seem at first glance to testify to a uncomplicated relation between past and present which, upon closer review, is revealed to be problematic. One of the most complex and captivating artistic testaments to what Andreas Huyssen has called 'twilight memory' -not only in Ravel's music, but in Western modernism as a whole - is the eighth and final waltz of his illano suite Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911). In this waltz, which Ravel entitled 'Éilllogue', the hope of making the past present is reborn with each of its numerous thematic recollections, only to be dashed repeatedly by the melancholy knowledge of its impossibility. In the present study, affinities between the Éilllogue's musical behaviours and philosophical accounts of memory by Bergson, Jankélévitch and Nora are explored, along with the compositional precedents established by Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy and others.<br>

Abstract: Kant's progressive philosophy of history is an integral aspect of his critical system, yet it is often ignored or even treated as an embarrassment by contemporary scholars. In this article, I defend Kant and argue for the continuing relevance of his regulative assumption of historical progress. I suggest, furthermore, that the first-person stance of practical belief exemplified in Kant's conception of hope offers new resources for thinking about the relationship between the ideal and the real in political theory.<br>

Abstract: Através de urna abordagem metodológica centrada na reflexão dialética, o presente artigo tem como principal objetivo questionar urna suposta essencialidade natural ou cultural da natureza humana associada as experiencias religiosas e ao sagrado. Este tema constitui uma aporia, pois a religiosidade do ser humano pode ser concebida como fenómeno cultural e natural, humano e sobre-humano, social e individual. Além da indagação sobre a naturalidade ou culturalidade da religião no ser humano, algumas perguntas colocadas no artigo, designadamente na problematização, visam acirrar o pensamento critico sobre esta temática em torno da essencialidade da natureza humana, tais como: a religiosidade é um fenómeno humano, natural e atemporal ou é social, cultural e temporal? É um fenómeno racional ou consciente enquanto alimento da esperança? Tendo em conta que a religiosidade está associada a determinados valores, será racional porque os fins das práticas respondem as convicçôes e aos ditos valores e porque o sentido da experiencia religiosa está inscrito ñas formas de linguagem e de conduta, bem como nos valores que as motivam? Through a methodological approach centered on reflection and dialectics, the main purpose of this article is to inquiry a hypothetical natural or cultural essence of human nature, which is associated with religious experiences and the sacred. This theme is an aporia, because the religiosity of the human being can be conceived as a cultural and natural, human and superhuman, social and individual phenomenon. Besides the questioning about natural or cultural religion in human beings, some questions placed in the article, namely in the questioning part, aim to sharpen critical thinking on this subject around the essence of human nature, such as: Is the religiosity a human, natural and timeless phenomenon, or it is social, cultural and temporal? Is it a rational or conscious phenomenon to feed hope? Given that religiosity is associated with certain values, w~<br>

Abstract: From the Balfour declaration of 1917 to the birth of Israel in 1948 a great catastrophe (Nakba) crashed down on Palestine which afterwards got worse with the exodus of the major part of Palestinian population and reached an highest point with the arab defeat of 1967 (Naksa,). During the following period (Nahda) the Palestinians pursued an increasing visibility through military resistance, Intifadah, political initiative and cultural mobilization. The Author stigmatizes the mistakes of Palestinian leaders as well as the colonial policy carried on by Israel. Recollecting the experience of the South-African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he thinks that a true reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis will be impossible if they don't enter in a different mood, forgiving about Nakba and Shoah respectively and trying to convert their common pain and sorrow into hope and confidence in a shared future. Depuis la déclaration Balfour de 1917 jusqu'á la résolution du partage-découpage de la Palestine en 1947 et á la création d'Israël en 1948 la Palestine fit l'expérience d'une grande catastrophe (Nakba), qui devint tragique dans les années suivantes lorsqu'on assista á un véritable éclatement du corps social palestinien et culmina dans la défaite de 1967 (Naksaj. L'aprés-guerre de 1967 marqua un tournant majeur dans la mesure où les Palestiniens accédérent á la visibilité par la resistance militaire, par le soulévement dans les territoires occupés (Intifadah), par l'inititaive politique et par la mobilisation culturelle (Nahda). L'Auteur stigmatise soit les erreurs commis par les directions palestiniennes soit la politique coloniale pratiquée par Israël. Il voit dans l'obsession du Nakba pour les uns et de la Shoah pour les autres des obstacles qu'ilfaut dépasser pour ouvrir la voie d'une réconciliation véritable entre Palestiniens et Israéliens.<br>

Publisher: British Sociological Association Publications Limited<br>
Issue: i40108657<br>
Date: 5 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Hay Colin<br>
Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Abstract: L'article dessine une ellipse à deux foyers que toute tentative dépenser la religion avec les moyens de la philosophie devra parcourir. Le premier pôle est occupé par le concept de « religion », le second par la pluralité irréductible des religions historiques. Selon qu'on se place dans l'optique de la « religion naturelle », ou dans celle de la « philosophie de la religion », cette ellipse revêtira une allure différente. Publiés il y a deux siècles, les Discours sur la religion de Friedrich Schleiermacher sont une des premières tentatives d'aborder cette ellipse dans l'optique d'une philosophie de la religion. L'originalité de cette approche prend encore plus de relief si on la compare avec la tentative kantienne de déployer les représentations, les croyances et les institutions religieuses sous l'égide de la question : « Que m'est-il permis d'espérer ? ». Autant les thèses que Schleiermacher défend dans le deuxième et le cinquième Discours gardent une grande actualité, autant son analyse du judaïsme atteste la difficulté de conjuguer un éloge de la pluralité avec une pensée de l'altérité. The article sketches a bifocal model which any attempt to give a philosophical meaning to the difference of religions must keep in mind. The first focus expresses the necessity of a concept of religion as such, the second deals with the irreducible difference and plurality of positive religions. This tension has a different shape if it is analysed through the pattern of « natural religion » or the pattern of philosophy of religion. Two centuries ago, Friedrich Schleiermacher's Reden über die Religion give us an excellent example of the second approach. Its originality can be higlightened, if we compare Schleiermacher's thesis in the second and the fith discourse, with Kant's attempt to develop a philosophical understanding of religious representations, beliefs and institutions in the light of the question : « What may hope ? ». Even if Schleiermacher's « breviary of romantic reli~<br>

Abstract: Os direitos humanos precisam ser repensados em tempos de crescente suspeição teórica e prática. Neste artigo, procura-se contribuir para a reflexão sobre os direitos humanos a partir do contraste entre duas alternativas teóricas, aqui representadas pelas propostas divergentes de Marie-Bénédicte Dembour e Paul Ricoeur. A primeira caracteriza-se por desenvolver uma visão niilista dos direitos humanos, que pressupõe a negação de qualquer fundamento aos direitos humanos para além da retórica ocidental. A segunda apresenta-se como uma nova confiança hermenêutica, assentada na riqueza e na fragilidade das promessas de direitos subjacentes às declarações universais dos direitos humanos. Do contraste entre essas duas perspectivas, espera-se evidenciar que a intensificação das suspeitas sobre o que se constata na teoria e na prática dos direitos humanos exige sempre do filósofo uma nova atestação do que é fundamentalmente digno do humano nos direitos humanos. Human rights need to be rethought in a time of increasing theoretical and practical suspicion. In this article, we seek to contribute to the reflection on human rights, from the contrast between two theoretical alternatives, here represented by the divergent approaches of Marie-Bénédicte Dembour and Paul Ricoeur. The first is characterized by the development of a nihilistic view of human rights, which presupposes the denial of any ground for human rights beyond western rhetoric. The second presents itself as a new hermeneutic confidence, grounded in the richness and fragility of the promises of rights underlying the universal declarations of human rights. From the contrast between these two perspectives, we hope to show that the intensification of suspicions about the theory and practice of human rights requires always from the philosopher a new attestation of what is fundamentally worthy of the human nature in the human rights.<br>

Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>

Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: Theories of recognition provide an understanding of selfhood as based on narrative identity. In striking up and maintaining a relationship with the Other through telling my story, I am acknowledged as a conversation partner and as a self, endowed with a personal history and biographical experience. The driving force of this process is the hope or struggle for recognition, for being seen and acknowledged by the Other. This essay uses Paul Ricoeur's concept of recognition to read fictional first-person narration as a scenario of encounter between narrator and addressee. It draws from narrative psychology, autobiography theory, and narratological concepts of reader positioning to consider how readers encounter a fictional narrator. The relevance of such a reception-based model is illustrated by revisiting two classics of twentieth-century American literature featuring narrators who raise their voices from the margins: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man. By reading these novels as narratives of recognition, I argue that the rise to iconic status of the narrators, Holden Caulfield and the Invisible Man, can be related to the intense scenario of address that calls readers to recognize these fictional tellers.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178171<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Johnson Nuala C<br>
Abstract: Drawing on the theoretical insights of Paul Ricoeur this paper investigates the geographies of public remembrance in a post-conflict society. In Northern Ireland, where political divisions have found expression through acts of extreme violence over the past 30 years, questions of memory and an amnesty for forgetting have particular resonance both at the individual and societal level, and render Ricoeur's framework particularly prescient. Since the signing of the Belfast Agreement in 1998, initiating the Peace Process through consociational structures, discovering a nomenclature and set of practices which would aid in the rapprochement of a deeply divided society has presented a complex array of issues. In this paper I examine the various practices of public remembrance of the 1998 bombing of Omagh as a means of understanding how memory-spaces evolve in a post-conflict context. In Omagh there were a variety of commemorative practices instituted and each, in turn, adopted a different contour towards achieving reconciliation with the violence and grief of the bombing. In particular the Garden of Light project is analysed as a collective monument which, with light as its metaphysical centre, invited the populace to reflect backward on the pain of the bombing while at the same time enabling the society to look forward toward a peaceful future where a politics of hope might eclipse a politics of despair.<br>

Abstract: This essay redefines the task of the reader in light of Christian hope, unfolding how a theology of hope might ground literary criticism. The resulting approach to literature—hopeful reading—considers texts in light of their future becoming in the Kingdom of God. Rather than considering texts as purveyors of hope or possibility for a readers future, hopeful reading asks critics to non-instrumentally foreground the possibilities in a text's future. The essay explains Christian hope, shows how it might warrant and construct a literary critic's vocation, and offers several extended examples of contemporary critics who seem to be reading hopefully.<br>

Abstract: Yves Bonnefoy est plus reconnu encore par sa réflexion sur la poésie que par son œuvre même. À partir de l'analyse d'un texte de 1959, on étudie cette conception, dont les mots-clés sont : finaude, présence, espoir, ici et maintenant, absolu; les références décisives : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Léopardi. On complète grâce à des écrits ultérieurs, qui témoignent contre l'univers des notions, l'occultisme surréaliste, la clôture linguistique, et insistent sur la forme, le son de la poésie. Yves Bonnefoy is better known for his reflections on poetry than for his own works. Here based on an analysis of a text from 1959, the author studies Bonnefoy's perspective of which the key-words are perfection, presence, hope, the here and the now, the absolute; the principal influences are : Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Leopardi The study concludes with a consideration of his later works, which testify against the universe of notions, surrealist occultism, linguistic boxs, while insisting on form and sound of poetry.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i405180<br>
Date: 9 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): van DongenAbstract: In this article, I consider narratives told within a clinical setting. I argue that personnel in a day center for people with acquired brain damage are constantly involved in narrating about the disabled participants. The negotiation of who the participant is, and foremost will be, is in constant negotiation in regard to issues of hope. I further argue that hope is a meaning-making process and, as such, it has been defined as crucially connected to time. Hope has been said to enable a connection between the present and the future, because action taken in the present could bring about (positive) change in the future. However, I show that hope, in relation to narratives told about people with severe disabilities that are considered "incurable," must be understood within a realm of narrative foreclosure. Time seems to have lost the openness of its horizon for these people, and a narrative that tells of immediacy rather than chronology is created, resulting in hope being established within the present.<br>

Abstract: Pamela M. Yee is a doctoral candidate and Provost's Fellow in the English department at the University of Rochester. Her research interests include late-medieval romance and dream-visions, confessional narratives, medieval medicine, cognition, psychology, affect theory, trauma studies, and the medical humanities; a secondary strand of her scholarship includes all things Arthurian and a nascent interest in medievalism within pop culture. Her dissertation explores confessional tropes as narrative, dialogic, and patient-centered healing in late Middle English secular literature. She has recently published articles in
            ArthurianaandThe Once and Future Classroom, and has a forthcoming review inMedievally Speaking. In summer 2013, she curated an exhibit titled “Eugène Vinaver's MagnificentMalory” for the Rossell Hope Robbins Library. Her budding interest in Gower studies has resulted in a recent flurry of activity: her co-organizing of the 3rdInternational Congress of the John Gower Society in summer 2014 and her selection by JGS as the graduate student representative for the 2016 John Hurt Fisher Prize Committee. At her home institution, she serves as Assistant Editor of the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, works as a library assistant for the Robbins Library, contributes to theCamelot Project, and teaches in the Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program.

Abstract: I once saw my name posted on a listserve for people harboring the hope that Internet technology would finally lead them to find their disappeared loved ones. With this history-loaded search as the premise for
            Doubles, I came up with fictional email correspondence that weaved together the real identities of all the namesakes I could find on the web. The piece originally was published online: anyone searching for me or any other Mónica de la Torre inevitably came upon it. It so happened that one of the people who ended up readingDoublesonline was the actual mother of the woman whose search inspired the piece. She got a hold of my email, and wrote to me with the certainty that I'd know how she could find her daughter. Years had gone by. I had no leads to offer; the email I had for the daughter was no longer valid.

Abstract: In chapter 2, Gatsby is not even mentioned, so reader curiosity is further stimulated by his absence. Inquisitiveness about Gatsby is further reawakened in the very first paragraph of chapter 3: “There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights” (39). Readers hope that they will learn more about Gatsby through this repeated mention that he is Nick's “neighbor,” but this turns out to be a faulty presumption because even though Nick describes in great detail the first party he attends, Gatsby remains a figure in the shadows. Reader desires are further deferred at this point through rumors and false statements. A woman relates an incident when Gatsby bought her a new dress when her old one had been ruined at one of his parties. Her friend answers: “There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that…. He doesn't want any trouble with
         anybody.” The woman disagrees: “I don't think it's so muchthat… it's more that he was a German spy during the war” (43–44). Guests then testify about a host nobody seems to know or recognize. And when Gatsby finally appears, he does so in a shimmer of anonymity:
               This technique of mystery runs through the whole novel. As with most mysteries, however, the curiosity is more intriguing in the beginning than toward the end if only because the eventual revelation of the “true story” resolves rather than increases the suspense. We have seen how Gatsby's background and economic enterprises have been purposely obscured through repeated narrative frequency, by having the information being retold and repeated with different content by several characters. This mystification of Gatsby is an important part of creating narrative movement and progress and therefore sustains a flow in the early chapters that encourages the reader's inclusion.I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedg~<br>

Abstract: If Dekuah signifies the unwillingness to live, or reminds us of the Frankenstein syndrome, as suggested above, it is no surprise that the child in the poem immediately announces that he is not Dekuah; he has not come to die. Emphasizing the singularity of his existence, his will to live, he says, “I've never been born before,” and then goes on to announce what he is and what he desires. “My name is Nehklon / Let me live.” Of particular relevance is the shift from the negative declaration “I am not” to a positive one, “I am.” In this linguistic switch, the poet signals a deeper moral and existential consequence. In this shift from a reactionary attitude to life to one that is proactive, Jabbeh Wesley brings the challenges of life affirmation to the consciousness of her readers. Through Nehklon, she enables us to imagine people taking charge of their lives, as Primo Levi does in his “If This Is a Man.” It is therefore not only Nehklon who pleads; all Liberians plead for a chance to live, for a fair share in life's bounty. There is nothing to be happy about in the remembrance of the war's violence; there is no happy ending for the narrative other than the hope that people might be allowed to live and to thrive. People are not Dekuahs; they have not come to die.<br>

Abstract: Without sovereignty and without ownership, we are responsible for what we cannot and do not control, for our unconscious fears and desires and their effects on others. The fragile hope is that by acknowledging the death drive within ourselves, we can begin to prevent killing and never give up trying to find ways to abolish death penalties in all their forms. The death drive is not the Kantian notion of death as the great equalizer but, rather, the tension in life itself, both destructive and creative, always conjoined with both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, and the ambiguities of life that not only exceed but also expose the fantasy of death as an absolute end point or final resting place. Far from the Perpetual Peace of the Dutch innkeeper's sign, with which Kant ironically opens his essay, the death drive is the force that fuels the fantasy of the end of life as everlasting peace.<br>

Abstract: The year 1961 seems like an age ago. In that year President Ike Eisenhower seemed old and tired. He spoke prophetically, however, in his farewell address when he introduced the phrase “military-industrial complex.” It named what he considered to be a major threat for a new dimension of corruption of the political and governmental processes in this country. He also predicted that universities in the United States would lose a significant measure of their academic freedom if they accepted federal funds for government-initiated research. John F. Kennedy, in 1961, took the oath of office as this country's thirty-fifth president. He was a figure of hope and a new generation of dynamic leaders, and in his inaugural address he spoke eloquently of freeing the oppressed people of the world but seemed oblivious to issues of oppression and social justice in this country.<br>

Abstract: That correlationism is a red herring is made plain by turning to the most sensible voice in the new debate, Bruno Latour, who was a student of Michel Serres's and whose work in “science studies”—conducted under the motto of the title of his first major book,
            We Have Never Been Modern—has been to show that science does not drop out of the sky. One would be hard put to differentiate what Latour calls his “non-modernism” from what Continental philosophers (loosely called “postmodern”) are saying. Indeed Latour's work had led to the charge that even he does not “believe in reality,” an objection that only momentarily left him speechless but quickly led to a wonderful book entitledPandora's Hope.
                  There he argues that, far from being opposed to each other, our power of “construction”—read “constitution”—goes hand in hand with “reality.” The more construction—the more sophisticated the scientific community, the more complicated the experiment, the more technical the laboratory instruments, the more funding for research—the more reality science will attain. Unhappily, Latour dismisses phenomenology as a “philosophy of consciousness,” as if the entire history of phenomenology after Husserl never happened. Don Ihde, one of the SPEP's most distinguished thinkers, has called Latour to task on just this point.32
               
                  Latour's point applies no less to religion.33
               
                  Religious beliefs and practices are certainly constructed—in concrete cultures, languages, traditions, and historical worldviews. The people whose practices these are understand (just like the people who actually practice science) both that they have composed these prayers, constructed these places of worship, made these statues, and so on34
               andthat in them they access something real that they have not made.<br>

Abstract: The two essays that follow situate their gaze on Shaw's cosmology. Jay Tunney's moving, evocative piece, “The Spiritual Shaw,” again affirms the profundity of Shaw's close relationship with his father, Gene. The extraordinary experience on the island of Brioni was a powerful moment in Shaw's ongoing reflection about the intersection of the physical and metaphysical, manifested (among other places) in his keenness for boxing. Witnessing Polly Tunney's painful and near-fatal appendicitis attack, Gene's faith, and the miraculous arrival of two medical saviors, Shaw was deeply affected by what Tunney describes as the “simplicity and enormity of the circumstance,” and thereafter “prayer broadened his definition of the human spirit.” With the reputed interconnection between health and hope as his starting point, Howard Ira Einsohn also explores Shaw's moral and religious philosophy in “Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur: Emissaries of Hope, Faith, and Wellness.” Einsohn's commentary traces convergences in the thinking of both figures to articulate how Shaw's tragic-optimism acts as “his equilibrium, his wellness, in a world wildly out of kilter.”<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: As Ruth Levitas has explained, a liberal-humanist understanding of the function of utopia is underrepresented in critical literature in utopian studies. Marxist interpretations of utopia's function in human history are currently the dominant paradigm for explaining the function of utopia. However, the discipline of rhetoric offers utopists a well-established tradition of theorizing about the encounter between symbolic, aesthetically mediated expressions of hope and actualized societies. Rhetoric, a field that was an original and essential foundation of the liberal-humanist tradition, is replete with examples of utopian ideation and imagery. From its origins in classical Greece, through its practice as a tool of transformation during the Reformation, and into its use as a twentieth-century critical tool for explaining the constitutive nature of discourse, the art of rhetoric inherently evokes the concept of utopia to persuade a civic audience. Modern rhetorical theory continues to overlap with the work of utopists of both liberal-humanist and Marxist philosophies. The continuity of this approach is demonstrated in the way that Marxist theorists who are usually considered utopists—Mannheim, Bloch, Marcuse—can be read as rhetorical theorists in the parts of their works that focus on the aesthetic and symbolic mediation of utopia. The art (
         techne) of rhetorical invention explored by rhetorical theorists is essentially the same as the anticipatory impulse explored by Bloch and Marcuse.<br>

Abstract: This opposition between the static and the dynamic—and the triumph of the latter in
         Finnegans Wake—is modeled by Sheldon Brivic in terms of Joyce's symbolic uses of gender within the novel: “The male story enacts conflict and decline, but the female one may be seen as showing discovery and development that proceed through the disintegration of the discourse of patriarchal coherence.”
               Yet one might suggest not so much that the novel is about gender difference as that it deploys gender difference to symbolize the dichotomy between the static and dynamic historical perspectives upon which it reflects. Brivic admits that his feminist reading of156
            Finnegans Wakeshould not claim to reveal the novel's “ultimate or real meaning”—and if (as he writes) the novel represents “history as progress through literary work” in a way that offers “freedom through the disintegration of stable identity,”
               then it may be that, in order to engage with that progressive idealism, such determining terminologies as157
            feminism—orUtopianism, for that matter—and all of the categorical polarizations they involve might no longer seem particularly relevant. A static Utopia has no need for Utopianists (perfect worlds do not need dreamers); and a dynamic Utopia—a world populated by such aspirants—would have no need for such deterministic, static, and outmoded categorizations. A progressive Utopia must be unfinished; it is not a state but a perpetual coming-into-state in which all of its subjects continue to dream, to hope, to aspire. This work of progress is, likeFinnegans Wake, an unendingwork in progress. It may at first seem incongruous that this Utopia of unceasing movement is also the Utopia of real, material place, but it is clear that one of the defining characteristics of material reality is that it never stays still.<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Setting aside for a moment the tendency of relativism (or extreme subjectivity) to enervate leaps toward the possible-impossible (of Henri Lefebvre's Utopia in the positive), in contemporary social and political thought (identified by David Harvey as leading—by way of its uncertainty—to a nonproductive “both/and” cul-de-sac),
         Utopiaanddystopiareally cannot be interchangeable, as their aims are diametrically opposed. Even when the sense thatdystopiais the opposite ofUtopiapersists in definitions of the two terms, common usage tends to muddy the affair. In common parlance, the move is from difference to a conception of dystopia as “inverted Utopia” and from there to a kind of interchangeability between them: “a strand of utopianism or dystopianism,” as one writer put it, suggesting their indivisibility.
               Conjoining the two terms establishes a “both/and” condition and at best promises only confusion or at worst presupposes failure. If the first drains Utopia of its oppositional (or critical) dimension, the second asserts that Utopia is always already dystopia, no matter how initially attractive its proposition. In contrast, it would be more productive to maintain the “either/or” divide (arrived at dialectically) argued for by Harvey in19
            Spaces of Hope(2000). Only by making a deliberate decision between alternatives, that is, only when one option is cut off, can life be promised to the other. It is no wonder, then, that the verbto decidecarries within its very meaning a sense of necessary certainty, and judgment as well.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>
