  Abstract: I have to apologize—being not a Girardian—when starting with an idea introduced in the text on “Violence and Religion: Cause or Effect?”: “The question of religious violence is first and foremost a human question, . . . and not a directly religious question” (Girard 2004).<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: One rewrites in order to improve a text. Sometimes the result is thought to be the better expression of an original meaning; at other times, it extends the idea in a new direction. In any case, textual revision is a process characterized by imperfection, change, negotiation, and fallibility. Traditionally, realism has seemed to be above this process: One identifies the relations of power or suffers the consequences. This attitude is reflected in the standard invocation of the classics of realism, which are seen as equivalent statements of a core doctrine of universal truths. From Thucydides to Machiavelli to Morgenthau, there<br>

In connection with this, I also propose to show that this birth of psychological man, like that of social man, is brought about by purely mimetic mechanisms.<br>

  Abstract: When Everett C. Parker conducted the first major study of religious radio broadcasting in America, he had no idea what he would discover.¹ It was 1941, and World War II was drawing the nationʹs attention to Europe as the commercial radio networks already garnered large national audiences. Parker sent questionnaires to the management of all commercial radio stations in Chicago, hoping to gain a snapshot of their religious programming, including how much of it they aired, which types of religious programming seemed to hold listenersʹ interests, and how station management funded such broadcasts.

  Abstract: When I finished graduate school in English in 1970, I had two schemes for writing about modern literature. The first was my dissertation, which was a structuralist analysis of modernism, based almost exclusively on my reading of Lévi-Strauss but alleviated providentially by encountering Edward Said, who was a visiting researcher in 1968 at the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois. I depended heavily on Said’s 1967 delimiting review of

  Book Title: Memory Work-Anne Truitt and Sculpture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): de Baca Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Memory Workdemonstrates the evolution of the pioneering minimalist sculptor Anne Truitt. An artist determined to make her way through a new aesthetic in the 1960s, Truitt was tireless in her pursuit of a strong cultural voice. At the heart of her practice was the key theme of memory, which enabled her not only to express personal experience but also to address how perception was changing for a contemporary viewership. She gravitated toward the idea that an object in one's focus could unleash a powerful return to the past through memory, which in turn brings a fresh, even critical, attention to the present moment. In addition to the artist's own popular published writings, which detail the unique challenges facing female artists,Memory Workdraws on unpublished manuscripts, private recordings, and never-before-seen working drawings to validate Truitt's original ideas about the link between perception and mnemonic reference in contemporary art. De Baca offers an insider's view of the artist's unstinting efforts to realize her artistic vision, as well as the cultural, political, and historical resonances her oeuvre has for us today.<br>

  Abstract: We have now come to a threshold. Regardless of whether the preceding chapters have examined musical knowledge via concepts, language, or sensation, the knowledge proposed has always been culturally inflected. What else could it have been? Musical knowledge is cultural knowledge. That is so virtually by definition. Or it would be, if we could somehow stabilize the protean term
                  culture. Culture is something—a word, an idea, a metaphor—that we cannot seem to do without but that we always ask to do too much work for us. For present purposes, the term may be taken to denote the loose<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what~<br>

  Abstract: The following essay by Henry Munn presents a necessary complication of the ʺoralityʺ issue in ethnopoetics (see above, passim)—the location of a concept of ʺbookʺ and ʺwritingʺ at center of the genuine ethnopoetics of a major oral poet (see above, p. 187). The interested reader can relate it to the proposal of an archécriture (or primal writing)—the idea of writing itself as, in David Antinʹs term, a ʺnatural genreʺ co-equal with speech, etc.—presented in the workings of such a contemporary philosopher as Jacques Derrida (see above, p. 139).

It begins, literally and figuratively, with a prelude, and dwells on the minute particulars of both the music and its performance. The idea is to embark in medias res without too firm a sense of ultimate direction.

Following Goethe′s lead in seeing the prince as more of a neurotic than a hero, Greenblatt tests Jacques Lacan′s idea that the subject is the doing of the phantasm (1979) by actually traversing Hamlet′s ghost in history, so to speak. ″Something have you heard of Hamlet′s transformation: so I call<br>

  Abstract: The idea of scale is useful because historians agree that religions such as Buddhism, with their “karmic eschatologies,” emerged during India’s “second urbanization”(the first of course associated with the Indus valley civilizations). During this period small communities were linked to each other by trade networks and the imperialist designs of emergent empires. Similar, although not identical, social changes were occurring in the small Greek city-states, although the scale of change was not as great as in India. Avoiding terms like

  Abstract: The decade that followed the events of July 1952 critically altered the conventional assumptions of post–World War I Egyptian historiography. This impact was obvious.

Subscribing to the idea that the task of historiography is mainly that of studying shifts in historical representation, they emphasized the changing image of several rulers and popular leaders.¹ Though the issue of changing historical images was the most visible historiographical trait<br>

  Abstract: The spatial, hierarchical cosmopolis developed in Tokugawa writings lay in ruins by the first decade of the Meiji period. No longer did it appear axiomatic that political rectitude and geographic centrality were paired in some definable locale, be it China, Edo, Kyoto, rural villages, or the purportedly perfect Dutch nation. Nevertheless, even as the relationship between politics and nature was destabilized in the upheavals of the 1860s and 1870s, writers continued to believe that nature was a politically potent idea. The sheer number of references to nature demonstrates that they imagined they could wring rhetorical advantage from the concept, although<br>

  Abstract: Overcoming Onto-theology is a stunning collection of essays by Merold Westphal, one of America's leading continental philosophers of religion, in which Westphal carefully explores the nature and the structure of a postmodern Christian philosophy. Written with characteristic clarity and charm, Westphal offers masterful studies of Heidegger's early lectures on Paul and Augustine, the idea of hermeneutics, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Derrida, and Nietzsche, all in the service of building his argument that postmodern thinking offers an indispensable tool for rethinking Christian faith. A must read for every student and professor of continental philosophy and the philosophy of religion, Overcoming Onto-theology is an invaluable collection that brings together in one place fourteen provocative and lucid essays by one of the most important thinkers working in American philosophy today.<br>

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: Two objections arise repeatedly in connection with Emmanuel Levinas’s philosophy of language. First, it is argued, in the spirit of Jürgen Habermas and K. O. Apel, for whom ethics is grounded in discursive reason, that for Levinas ethics is an unmediated relation to the other and, as such, transcends linguistic and conceptual structure. Ethics is not a matter of moral argument but of solicitation by the other, who by virtue of sheer otherness resists violence. Levinas’s access routes to the other are nonlinguistic: they include the human face, an idea of the infinite that exceeds any description of it, and<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I suggest that conventional ethics, which is oriented toward the good, is challenged by psychoanalytic theory. Lacan’s work allows us to distinguish between desire for the Other, which is limited to symbolic language, and desire for the Thing, which lies beyond the symbolic in the Real. Primarily by reading Lacan’s discussion of the Thing in
                  The Ethics of Psychoanalysis, I relate the idea of the Thing to the idea of God, which later becomes the focus of chapter 8, where I contrast Lacan with Jean-Luc Marion’s understanding of God as Good rather than as Being. The desire<br>

In no way does he ever engage in anything like proofs for God’s existence, evidence for the validity of religious experience, or any consideration of the rational coherence of an idea of the divine. And yet his work is imbued and overflows with Christian imagery and references to Christian sources.

Despite the attempts to restore humanism to a spiritualist, Marxist, or existentialist form, the great humanist tradition could not withstand the dual trauma of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, in which the opposite of humanity laid waste to the very idea of humanity.¹ Regardless of the direct and even instrumental conditions that underpin the drafting of the “Letter,” the need of such an epistemological break is central to Heidegger’s text: a culture<br>

  Book Title: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER THOMAS M.<br>
  Abstract: The Human Eros: Eco-ontology and the Aesthetics of Existence explores themes in classical American philosophy, primarily that of John Dewey, but also in the thought of Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Santayana, and Native American traditions. The primary claim is that human beings exist with a need for the experience of meaning and value, a "Human Eros." Our various cultures are symbolic environments or "spiritual ecologies" within which the Human Eros can thrive. This is how we inhabit the earth. Encircling and sustaining our cultural existence is nature. Western philosophy has not generally provided adequate conceptual models for thinking ecologically. Thus the idea of "eco-ontology" undertakes to explore ways in which this might be done beginning with the primacy of Nature over Being, but also including the recognition of possibility and potentiality as inherent aspects of existence. I argue for the centrality of Dewey for an effective ecological philosophy. Both "pragmatism" and "naturalism" need to be contextualized within an emergentist, relational, non-reductive view of nature and an aesthetic, imaginative, non-reductive view of intelligence.<br>

  Abstract: My family migrated from Guåhan (Guam) to California in 1995, when I was a sophomore in high school. One of the reasons my parents decided to move was so that I could be better prepared to succeed in a “mainland” university. While I was excited about continuing my education, I had no idea how my family could afford college. After expressing this concern to my new high school counselor, he suggested I attend the Army recruiter’s presentation during the time when college recruiters visited our campus.<br>

  Author(s) Ormerod Neil<br>
  Abstract: The guiding idea of this book contends that a theologian’s personal (and communal) growth in religious, moral, intellectual, and psychic conversion marks the foundational reality of theology, and that constructing explicit theological foundations requires attention to the normative features of these conversions. This chapter focuses on religious conversion. It addresses that which strikes at the heart of who and what we are, at how we live, and toward what ends or goals our living tends. The approach to theology in this book asks that we maintain a keen awareness of the social and cultural contexts within which religious conversion takes<br>

  Book Title: The structure of modern cultural theory-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Thomas<br>
  Abstract: This book is about the claims of Cultural Theory as a particular kind of intellectual ethos or discipline. The book argues that Cultural Theory is best seen, at least in its ‘modern’ form, as an ethical discipline. As such, it should be seen as a form of inquiry governed by the guiding idea of the cultivation of critical autonomy and, as such, is designed as much to change what we are in our relations to ourselves as to describe the world as it is in particular ‘positive’ ways. The content of the book develops this argument through critical readings of three canonical writers, namely Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. A final chapter contrasts the ethical idea of modern Cultural Theory developed here with its postmodern derivations, which, it is argued, have taken both a more positivist and even more moralistic form.<br>

  Abstract: Much has been made in this book of the idea of modern cultural theory being ultimately ethical in its aims and outlook. Or at least, our principles of reading in relation to Adorno, Bourdieu and Foucault have been, in effect, ethico-critical ones; emphasising that these thinkers are best read not simply in ‘positive’ or epistemic terms but as contributing to a kind of ethically minded reconfiguration of ourselves as critical beings, something that has been shorthanded in terms of the ethics of autonomy.<br>

  Book Title: Britain and Africa Under Blair-In pursuit of the good state<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Julia<br>
  Abstract: Africa was a key focus of Britain’s foreign policy under Tony Blair. Military intervention in Sierra Leone, increases in aid and debt relief, and grand initiatives such as the Commission for Africa established the continent as a place in which Britain could ‘do good’. Britain and Africa under Blair: in pursuit of the good state critically explores Britain’s fascination with Africa. It argues that, under New Labour, Africa represented an area of policy that appeared to transcend politics. Gradually, it came to embody an ideal state activity around which politicians, officials and the wider public could coalesce, leaving behind more contentious domestic and international issues. Building on the story of Britain and Africa under Blair, the book draws wider conclusions about the role of ‘good’ and idealism in foreign policy. In particular, it discusses how international relationships provide opportunities to create and pursue ideals, and why they are essential for the wellbeing of political communities. It argues that state actors project the idea of ‘good’ onto idealised, distant objects, in order to restore a sense of the ‘good state’. The book makes a distinctive and original contribution to debates about the role of ethics in international relations and will be of particular interest to academics, policy-makers and students of international relations, Africa and British foreign policy, and to anyone interested in ethics in international affairs.<br>

  Abstract: I began this book with the idea that New Labour’s approach to Africa represented something different from foreign policy as usual. This position has often appeared difficult to defend: realist interpretations, those who pointed out the self-promotion or self-justification of politicians, and the sometimes justifiable charges of hypocrisy, all throw up compelling alternative explanations. None of these can be totally dismissed. There have been occasions on which British interests have been put before African welfare: the sale of a military air traffic system to Tanzania, and the tacit support for Ethiopian incursions into Somalia, for example.

Historical criticism was the servant of interpreting the Bible as revealed Scripture, but it was nevertheless an essential aspect of the interpretative process.

  Publisher: Pontificia Universidad Javeriana<br>
  Author(s): Arango Óscar Fernando Acevedo<br>
  Abstract: Este libro busca cuestionar la idea de que existe un único campo de la memoria, un campo dicotómico, reducido al forcejeo entre memorias “oficiales y no oficiales", entre organizaciones agonistas que le disputan la versión histórica y los olvidos a la memoria gubernativa. También busca mostrar cómo el campo de las memorias de las víctimas es enriquecido por otras posiciones, entre ellas, no solo las subalternas de los sin voz, sino las sub/alternas, que construyen un afuera de la disputa por el poder central, lo cual genera y deriva en poderes y prácticas culturales alternos. También señala cómo a estas memorias se suman las memorias reservadas, en reserva, a la espera de un momento específico para hacerse un lugar en el campo plural de las memorias. El libro inicia con un capítulo autobiográfico en clave de memoria sub/alterna, realiza una revisión conceptual de la concepción tradicional de la memoria y culmina con la exposición de estas categorías teóricas que ilustran otras posiciones y alternativas en el campo de la memoria. Aquí, no toda memoria que se sitúa aparentemente en una posición tiene garantías de permanecer en ella para siempre.<br>

  Abstract: Among the endlessly repeated motifs of the horror genre, none more reliably evokes a shudder than the idea of the undead, of humans doomed to wander between life and death. This response has a variety of deep psychological sources. Our anxiety in the face of our own mortality plays a part, as does a physiological revulsion to decaying bodies. Further, the sense of the living dead as ontologically other evokes in us a sense of numinous dread. Following Mary Douglas, the way such beings transgress the boundary separating life and death renders them both dangerous and impure.¹<br>

By entering into dialogue with these philosophical traditions, Llewelyn demonstrates the range and depth of his own original thinking.

  Abstract: In the first year and a half of Cassie’s life, her hair was basically not an issue because she didn’t have much. Then one day she came home from day care with a dozen tiny braids marking a complex and delicate pattern on her tiny head. I was, first of all, mystified. I had no idea she had enough hair to do anything like this. Where had all that hair come from? How had her teacher gathered it up like that? And how had she gotten her to sit still long enough to do it?<br>

We talk about it all the time in our everyday conversations, as if we know what it is. “What then is time? Provided that no one asks me, I know. If I want to explain it to an inquirer, I do not know.”¹ Something similar is true about the self: in late modern Western culture, we talk about selves—and “the self”—all the time.

  Book Title: The Insistence of God-A Theology of Perhaps<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): CAPUTO JOHN D.<br>
  Abstract: The Insistence of God presents the provocative idea that God does not exist, God insists, while God's existence is a human responsibility, which may or may not happen. For John D. Caputo, God's existence is haunted by "perhaps," which does not signify indecisiveness but an openness to risk, to the unforeseeable. Perhaps constitutes a theology of what is to come and what we cannot see coming. Responding to current critics of continental philosophy, Caputo explores the materiality of perhaps and the promise of the world. He shows how perhaps can become a new theology of the gaps God opens.<br>

But wherein resides the “art” within the “art of building” (

  Abstract: The idea that there is an interrelationship between ecological conditions and ways of life can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, and it was also prevalent in Enlightenment thought in the mid eighteenth century (for instance in Montesquieu and in the Marquis de Sade’s non-pornographic writings). Montesquieu, like many others, held that the main cause of Europe’s technological and scientific advances was the harsh climate, which required the inhabitants to be inventive and sharp-witted to survive. Two centuries later, the human geographer Ellsworth Huntington (1945) argued for climatic determinism in an original study where he shows, among other things,<br>

It has been the site of moral panics about the disintegration of traditional community and values as well as concerns around racism and segregation (see chapter 5). The notion of community is of central importance in contemporary policy and political thinking. So, for example, as Anna Marie Smith (1992) argues in the 1980s and early 1990s new right Thatcherite policy concentrated on creating a hegemonic project that aimed at defining social space through the construction of outsider figures.

But it is also entirely new, and the fact that Thomas More coined a self-canceling name for the island and the political idea associated with it tends to function somewhat like King Utopus’s moat, cordoning off that idea from the continent from which it might have come, either directly or indirectly.

  Abstract: There are few areas in which the idea of a possible French exception has asserted itself to such an extent as in the field of culture, and it is actually hardly surprising that the term ‘cultural exception’ has come to be associated with France, or a certain idea of France. The issue came to the forefront during the 1993 round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations, when France insisted on removing cultural products from the negotiations, on the grounds that ‘culture is not just another commodity’.

It is important to remember just what a shock the Pact was for all those on the left, whether inside or outside the PCF. For nearly five years the PCF’s strategy had been centred on the idea of the Popular Front; it had argued indefatigably that the struggle against fascism must take priority over everything else, including the struggle for socialism,<br>

Although the idea of ‘multi-sited fieldwork’ has become fashionable recently, good anthropology has always entailed a degree of multi-sitedness, even if some of those sites might be called ‘home’ and some might be encountered vicariously. Good anthropological training entails learning about many peoples and parts of the world and going to seminars beyond geographical specialisms.

  Abstract: The most persuasive moment of Paul Ricoeur’s work for the development anthropologist is his idea of narrative imagination. This concept, applied to the development act of working together with the other who faces marginalization, fear, famine, and isolation, provides a medium for both the anthropologist and the local to emplot history and fiction into a social reality that brings each to a new place. Far from static, this new place is an emerging plot that enables movement from shame and hunger to selfsustainability on the part of the local, and movement from the confinement of Western individualism to an ontological<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Book Title: The Idea of Wilderness-From Prehistory to the Age of Ecology<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): OELSCHLAEGER MAX<br>
  Abstract: Oelschlaeger begins by examining the culture of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, whose totems symbolized the idea of organic unity between humankind and wild nature, and idea that the author believes is essential to any attempt to define human potential. He next traces how the transformation of these hunter-gatherers into farmers led to a new awareness of distinctions between humankind and nature, and how Hellenism and Judeo-Christianity later introduced the unprecedented concept that nature was valueless until humanized. Oelschlaeger discusses the concept of wilderness in relation to the rise of classical science and modernism, and shows that opposition to "modernism" arose almost immediately from scientific, literary, and philosophical communities. He provides new and, in some cases, revisionist studies of the seminal American figures Thoreau, Muir, and Leopold, and he gives fresh readings of America's two prodigious wilderness poets Robinson Jeffers and Gary Snyder. He concludes with a searching look at the relationship of evolutionary thought to our postmodern effort to reconceptualize ourselves as civilized beings who remain, in some ways, natural animals.<br>

  Abstract: The anomalies of modernism, that paradigm for thought and action upon which the contemporary world rests, are reflected throughout the conceptual spectrum of chapter 9. Yet paradigmatic revolution—a profound change in consciousness, however foolish that idea seems—is in the wind, and humankind may be on the brink of a postmodern age. Of course such qualifiers as anti-or posttend to obscure the central issue: Modernism.¹ Crucially, the idea of wilderness appears to undergird a new paradigm for understanding humankind as embodying natural process grown self-conscious.

The belief in the resurrection of the dead constitutes an answer to a real challenge: What is the meaning of life and history in the midst of a world in which evil, injustice, and ultimately death exist? Resurrection is an instrument serving a broader, more encompassing reality: the Kingdom of God. Such a utopian Kingdom gathers the final response to the problem of theodicy and to the enigma of history. <CR><CR> This book seeks to understand the idea of resurrection not only as a theological but also as a philosophical category (as expression of the collective aspirations of humanity), combining historical, theological, and philosophical analyses in dialogue with some of the principal streams of contemporary Western thought.<br>

Theology is seen to derive from a number of sources: the biblical language, biblical rhetoric and composition, academic disciplines other than philosophy, and above all a careful exegesis of the biblical text. The essay on Psalm 23 makes use of anthropology and human-development theory; the essay on Deuteronomy incorporates Wisdom themes; the essay called "Jeremiah and the Created Order" looks at ideas not only about God and creation but also about the seldom-considered idea of God and a return to chaos; and the essay on the "Confessions of Jeremiah" examines, not the words that this extraordinary prophet was given by God to preach, but what he himself felt and experienced in the office to which he was called. One essay on "Biblical and theological themes" includes a translation into the African language of Lingala, which weaves together the story of early Christianity with the more recent founding of churches in Africa and Asia. Jack R. Lundbom argues eloquently through these essays that theology is rooted in biblical words, in themselves, in rhetoric and their different contexts.<br>

  Book Title: Biblical Knowing-A Scriptural Epistemology of Error<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bartholomew Craig G.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian Scriptures could be theologically described as beginning and ending with an epistemological outlook. The first episode of humanity’s activity centers on the knowledge of good and evil. The final stage of humanity is pictured by Jeremiah as a universally prophetic and knowing society: 'And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord', for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord' (Jer 31:34). What happens to knowledge in between? In this work, Dru Johnson reconsiders epistemology with the tool of biblical theology: an approach to knowledge as developed in Genesis 2 and explored throughout the Tanakh (i.e., the Old Testament) and New Testament. By re-examining the neglected idea that Christian Scripture might be developing robust descriptions of knowing that can direct us today, the ambition of this book is to lay the groundwork for a biblical theology of knowledge - how knowledge is broached, described, and how error is rectified within the texts of the Christian canon. Proper knowing as it occurs in the Scriptures means that there are better and worse ways to know. Even more, the epistemology that is found to be advocated in Scripture is not relegated to religious knowing. Johnson argues that scientific epistemology and biblical epistemology make significant points of contact suggesting that they are fundamentally consistent with each other.<br>

  Abstract: In the prior chapters, we have offered a view of knowing as a process that begins with listening to accredited authorities and then enacting their directions in order to see. Submission and praxis are not novel concepts in the history of Judaism or Christianity (or any religion for that matter). However, the idea that accredited authorities, process, and embodied participation form the centerpiece of all proper knowing is a more radical proposition.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine Bonhoeffer’s theology vis-à-vis economics. Admittedly, at first glance, this may appear as a rather farfetched idea, since Bonhoeffer was neither trained nor known as an economist and has left us no systematic treatment of his thought on that subject. Yet, there is the curious fact that Bonhoeffer’s entire adult life unfolded within an inexorable economic downward spiral. The height of that spiral was for Bonhoeffer in all probability the granting of his doctoral degree in theology in 1927.

Since martyrs are also called heroes, I hypothesize that true heroism is marked by a particular kind of courage, hope, and an ethic of risk. I assume that true heroism is a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for true religious martyrdom, and I<br>

  Abstract: The systematic study of gardens as loci of food production during the Middle Ages has largely been overlooked by agrarian historians. Economic agrarian history is based epistemologically on the idea that human actions can best be understood through their economic foundations and consequences, and methodologically on the idea that the best and most accurate conclusions can be reached from a base of quantifiable and documented evidence. This strong epistemological and methodological base has resulted in a large body of excellent and rigorous work. Its focus on numbers and documents has, however, largely obscured the economic importance of cultivation carried out<br>

  Abstract: The first paperback edition of a classic of American constitutional theory. The book is divided into two parts. In Part I Professor Tushnet appraises the five major competing "grand theories" of constitutional law and interpretation, and, argues that none of them satisfy their own requirements for coherence and judicial constraint. In Part II the author offers a descriptive sociology of constitutional doctrine and raises critical questions as to whether a grand theory is necessary, is it possible to construct a coherent, useful grand theory, and is construction of an uncontroversial grand theory possible?Professor Tushnet's new Afterword is organized in parallel fashion to the original text. Part I offers a new survey of the contemporary terrain of constitutional interpretation. Part II provides an extended discussion of the most prominent of contemporary efforts to provide an external analysis of constitutional law, the idea of regime politics.

  Book Title: Políticas culturales:-Acumulación, desarrollo y crítica cultural<br>
  Publisher: Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, sede México<br>
  Author(s): Kraniauskas John<br>
  Abstract: Mediadas por su interés en los estudios subalternistas, John Kraniauskas aborda en este volumen cuestiones de la crítica cultural rearticulando una idea básica: el concepto sin intuición es vacío, y la intuición sin concepto es ciega. Así, el autor sugiere que la crítica ideológica sin la cultural es vacía, y que ésta sin aquélla es ciega, y entra en diálogo con conceptos clave como “estudios culturales", “hibridez", “transculturación", “imperio", “desarrollo" o “subalternidad"; y con autores también clave como Stuart Hall, Néstor García Canclini, Homi Bhabha, Ángel Rama, Antonio Negri, Louis Althusser y Ernesto Laclau. El propósito de Kraniauskas es mostrar que si se piensa la transculturación sin tomar en cuenta la disyunción subalterna es arriesgarse a la ceguera política; y que pensar la subalternidad sin incluir la coyuntura transcultural se vaciaría a ésta de su contenido histórico. Se trata de discutir y analizar las políticas explícitas e implícitas de las teorías o conceptos. De esclarecer la política de la teoría en la teoría. Este volumen acompaña las interpretaciones literarias y fílmicas de Políticas literarias: poder y acumulación la literatura y el cine latinoamericanos (Flacso Méxcio, 2012).<br>

  Abstract: The central problem of translation, namely, the competition between faithfulness to meaning and preservation of form, grows more attenuated as translation moves from simple conveyance of information to artistic forms. Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended. The translator may also have to deal with problems of grammatical structure: a language may lack a particular verbal<br>

  Book Title: Ancestral Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: Ancestral ritual in early China was an orchestrated dance between what was present (the offerings and the living) and what was absent (the ancestors). The interconnections among the tangible elements of the sacrifice were overt and almost mechanical, but extending those connections to the invisible guests required a medium that was itself invisible. Thus in early China, ancestral sacrifice was associated with focused thinking about the ancestors, with a structured mental effort by the living to reach out to the absent forebears and to give them shape and existence. Thinking about the ancestors—about those who had become distant—required active deliberation and meditation, qualities that had to be nurtured and learned. This study is a history of the early Chinese ancestral cult, particularly its cognitive aspects. Its goals are to excavate the cult’s color and vitality and to quell assumptions that it was no more than a simplistic and uninspired exchange of food for longevity, of prayers for prosperity. Ancestor worship was not, the author contends, merely mechanical and thoughtless. Rather, it was an idea system that aroused serious debates about the nature of postmortem existence, served as the religious backbone to Confucianism, and may even have been the forerunner of Daoist and Buddhist meditation practices.<br>

  Book Title: In a Different Place-Pilgrimage, Gender, and Politics at a Greek Island Shrine<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dubisch Jill<br>
  Abstract: In a Different Placeoffers a richly textured account of a modern pilgrimage, combining ethnographic detail, theory, and personal reflection. Visited by thousands of pilgrims yearly, the Church of the Madonna of the Annunciation on the Aegean island of Tinos is a site where different interests--sacred and secular, local and national, personal and official--all come together. Exploring the shrine and its surrounding town, Jill Dubisch shares her insights into the intersection of social, religious, and political life in Greece. Along the way she develops the idea of pilgrimage-journeying away from home in search of the miraculous--as a metaphor for anthropological fieldwork. This highly readable work offers us the opportunity to share one anthropologist's personal and professional journey and to see in a "different place" the inadequacy of such conventional anthropological categories as theory versus data, rationality versus emotion, and the observer versus the observed.<br>

  Abstract: Los temas que constituyen el conjunto de este libro tienen diferentes pretextos teóricos. El interés principal ha sido recabar en este escrito un conjunto de reflexiones articuladas sobre la idea del poder y el proceso de comprensión del pasado que aborda Arendt. Este no se desarrolla a través de un proceder sistemático –como no lo es tampoco el pensamiento arendtiano– ni por medio de argumentos que supongan premisas necesarias para alcanzar las conclusiones buscadas. Cada uno de los capítulos emularía más bien la pieza de un “rompecabezas" que, al articularse y combinarse con las demás, logra construir ese cuadro representado por la teoría arendtiana.

  Author(s) Jeal Roy R.<br>
  Abstract: Thinking about perceptions of body as they are used in the Bible leads, inevitably, to reflecting on clothing and the idea of clothing. Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons. But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings. The ways in which bodies are clothed have far-reaching and sometimes<br>

  Abstract: Lezama’s theories cannot be reduced to a system of aesthetics in the philosophical sense of the term. Neither can they be reduced to a set of concepts that one would be able to define and use elsewhere. This is because in his theory of the arts there are no transhistorical constants that give sense to the history of forms. Even in a more specific or circumscribed setting, his method of reading rests on the idea that no two styles can be the same and, as an extension, that there are no two ways of putting together the materials that give<br>

  Abstract: Style has been a feature of the study of the Fourth Gospel for a long time. It has rarely been examined on its own terms, however; primarily, it has been used in a supporting function within source-critical research. This application of style focuses upon identifying and demarcating sources in and behind the text in its current form. The idea is that some parts of the Fourth Gospel exhibit a style that is inconsistent with the prevalent style of the Fourth Evangelist. In the history of source criticism, stylistic features have thus been used to prove (or, by critics, to disprove)<br>

  Abstract: A phenomenological description of dialectical criticism? The contradiction is not so great as it might at first glance appear. The peculiar difficulty of dialectical writing lies indeed in its holistic, “totalizing” character: as though you could not say any one thing until you had first said everything; as though with each new idea you were bound to recapitulate the entire system. So it is that the attempt to do justice to the most random observation of Hegel ends up drawing the whole tangled, dripping mass of the Hegelian sequence of forms out into the light with it.

In this work, a theoretical perspective is opened, which I define as the “contingency of antagonism” – an Adornian concept. I will argue: (a) that this is an original perspective, irreducible to any previous philosophical positions, (b) that Marx’s intuition finds a more sophisticated reformulation in Adorno, and (c) that the idea of a contingent antagonism can provide a key to overcome the apparently antinomical outcome of negative dialectic.

  Abstract: The idea of the tragic has permeated Western culture for millennia, and has been expressed theatrically since the time of the ancient Greeks. However, it was in the Europe of the twentieth century – one of the most violent periods of human history – that the tragic form significantly developed. ‘Modern European Tragedy’ examines the consciousness of this era, drawing a picture of the development of the tragic through an in-depth analysis of some of the twentieth century’s most outstanding texts.<br>

  Abstract: Pierre Bourdieu’s conception of habitus marks a theoretical step which no adequate understanding of social reality can ignore. By introducing habitus, Bourdieu is able both to integrate and to transcend major insights of the linguistic turn in philosophy, most prominently the idea that conscious intentional understanding necessarily relies on a host of implicit, practical, and holistic background assumptions which constitute meaning while being themselves unrepresented (Searle, 1989). The concept of habitus incorporates this idea since it shows that individual agency and its self-understanding are constituted by relying on an acquired social sense, the cognitive habitus, which defines how an agent<br>

Socrates in book 1 fends off the definitions of justice by the older Cephalus (who simply leaves before being questioned), the younger Polemarchus, and the “new man” Thrasymachus. The question at that point gets diverted from

  Book Title: Teoría contemporánea de los derechos humanos. Elementos para una reconstrucción sistémica-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): García José Antonio López<br>
  Abstract: El respaldo a la teoría de los derechos humanos, así como a las declaraciones y tratados internacionales, es un hecho geo-político de la mayor relevancia, al cual se han sumado por razones de convicción o conveniencia la mayoría de los países delo que llamamos “el mundo civilizado". Tales instrumentos se han convertido entonces en un punto de referencia obligado para cualquier estudio y discusión de carácter moral, jurídico y político, y en un paradigma para los valores humanos y criterios de legitimidad del ejercicio del poder público. La ciencia jurídica actual ha considerado que la dignidad humana es cualidad principalísima de todo ser humano, que debe ser respetada bajo cualquier circunstancia y bajo ese sustrato que fundamenta la convivencia social, la tendencia real es lograr su adecuada protección, encontrarla idea de que todos estamos involucrados en una tarea común; la tarea de conocer cuál es el vínculo que nos une en cuanto seres humanos o humanidad para llegar al cumplimiento de una responsabilidad de todas y todos; la preservación de la dignidad humana como núcleo esencial de los derechos humanos. El propósito de este libro es presentar, con una virtud de orientación teórica y sistémica, la más amplia información sobre las propuestas que los grandes tratadistas en la materia han formulado en los últimos años, haciendo énfasis en las expresiones que delimitan su concepción; tales como derechos naturales, derechos fundamentales, derechos subjetivos o derechos morales. Se resaltan también los aciertos y debilidades de sus distintas definiciones y de todo el elenco de categorías jurídicas relacionadas, para intentar ofrecernos un extenso panorama de lo que son o se consideran los derechos humanos y la forma en que su estudio se ha desarrollado desde el análisis de gabinete hasta la práctica. Para todo lo anterior, se abordan, entre otras, las teorías de los iusfilósofos recientes más reconocidos como Gregorio Peces-Barba, Luigi Ferrajoli, Angelo Papacchini,~<br>

  Abstract: En la actualidad — y desde la Alta Ilustración de la primera mitad del siglo XVIII — se viene cultivando intensamente la idea de que existe una dinámica interna en la
                  cultura. Se trata de una apelación que se encuentra asentada en concebir la realidad del objeto histórico como parte de una característica principal o rasgo distintivo que « evoluciona desde dentro » (naturalmente, como parte de su movimiento original) y que no es sino la forma ideológica bajo la que se ha encapsulado todo aquello que nosotros mismos (y los que nos antecedieron) hemos ido construyendo, aprendiendo y reproduciendo.

  Abstract: DESPITE HIS LATER practice of referring to himself as “Saint Mark,” in a mock canonization, Twain was not inclined to view saints positively. In
                  The Innocents Abroad(1869), for example, Twain summarily dismisses saints and their relics as “Jesuit humbuggery” (45). Relics of the saints trigger comedy rather than reverence, with Twain chiding, “as for the bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we have seen enough of them to duplicate him, if necessary” (131). Twain complains less about the idea of sainthood than about relics and the depictions of them, labeling them “rude” (103), “coarse” (187, 237), and “grotesque”<br>

  Abstract: Ireland in the Celtic Tiger years saw an unprecedented influx of ethnically diverse migrants to a nation formerly perceived as comparatively monocultural. Sketching the two dominant representations of post-Celtic Tiger multiculturalism, Amanda Tucker notes that the first of these ‘emphasizes that fear and hostility continue to characterize Irish responses to inward migration since the Gaelic Catholic monolith remains’ at the heart of twenty-first-century Irish identity, thus reinforcing ‘the idea of Ireland as a monocultural rather than multicultural society’ (Tucker, 2010: 107).¹ The second type of response claims that, despite the legal situation of immigrants, Ireland is a country traditionally open<br>

  Abstract: Artistically the Enlightenment may not compare favorably with the Renaissance or Baroque periods, but the aesthetic criticism of the eighteenth century surpassed that of the two earlier periods and provided most of the categories used in the two centuries that followed. One of its major achievements was to raise the idea of beauty to the level of truth. It accomplished this in three stages: at the beginning the imitation theory prevailed, next the expressive theory, and at the end the symbolic theory made a tentative entrance.

  Author(s) Hoberek Andrew<br>
  Abstract: IN THE LAST CHAPTER I presented evidence that students write more cogently about a text when they respond to another commentator than when they respond directly to the text itself. I argued that when students write poorly (on other subjects as well as literature), the reason is often that they are asked to generate an idea or interpretation in a void rather than to enter a conversation. But given the unfamiliarity of the conversations of the intellectual world, most students need help grasping these conversations and writing them into their texts. If this argument is valid, it follows that

Why is it Marx who seems to stand behind the idea that the social criticism of art is the best and most relevant way to approach this subject matter?” Well, it’s because whatever the outcome of Marxist thought may have proven to be or yet prove to be historically, it remains nevertheless the most devastating critique we have of social delusion as it both inspires and conditions works of art historically.

  Abstract: Ancient Jewish monotheism was generally uncomfortable with the idea of the preexistence of any entity to the creation of the world, a premise that would imperil the uniqueness of God as the single creator.

Implicitly, allowing any role to such a founding and formative entity would reintroduce a type of myth that could recall the pagan mythology, where once again the relationship between the preexistent deities as a crucial condition for the cosmogonic process would be thrown into<br>

  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  Abstract: Democratic self-government cannot be achieved, even in principle, by way of a politics of popular voice.

The purpose of this and the final three chapters is to lay out the basic terms of constitutionalism as democracy: its theory of judicial review, its interpretive method, its fundamental rights.<br>

  Abstract: If, as Benedict Anderson has suggested, the idea of a nation is in large measure imagined retrospectively, the Soviet Union offers an interesting counterpoint—that of a nation imagined prospectively.¹ The Soviet Union literally had to be invented. As is well known, cinema was expected to play a crucial role in this process. Surely it was for such a purpose that Lenin anointed cinema the premier socialist artform. Many Soviet films of the twenties were devoted to consolidating a tradition for the new nation, commemorating its revolutionary founding in historical spectacles, like V. I. Pudovkin’s

In addition, in 1927 he was working on his article for theEncyclopedia Britannicawith the cooperation of Heidegger, and in April 1928 he wrote the Amsterdam Lectures—in all of which the idea of a phenomenological, intentional psychology remained at the center of his attention.

LaPsicologia delle visioni del mondo, pubblicata da Karl Jaspers nel 1919, reagiva allo stesso problema. In un momento di crisi dell’Europa, legata alla perdita di un’idea universale e unica di verità e all’emergere di diverse forme di fanatismo, l’opera jaspersiana si proponeva un’analisi fenomenologica delle visioni del mondo, attenta non solo al lato soggettivo,<br>

This fixation, or, rather, the urgency of its mediation in not only artistic but also cultural, economic, and political arenas is inextricably linked to an ongoing elaboration of a Hong Kong identity. But assertions of “who we are” are often intimately related to suppositions of “where we are,” an idea captured in the<br>

  Book Title: La influencia de las víctimas en el tratamiento jurídico de la violencia colectiva.-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): Maculan Elena<br>
  Abstract: Este libro es el fruto de la investigación realizada en el marco del Proyecto de I+D+i “La influencia de las víctimas en el tratamiento jurídico de la violencia colectiva" (ref. DER2013-43760-R), financiado por el Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad.Este proyecto pretendía dar respuesta a los múltiples dilemas jurídicos, políticos y sociales que plantea el surgimiento, principalmente por vía jurisprudencial y a nivel internacional, en los últimos veinte años, de un cuerpo de derechos de las víctimas de graves violaciones de derechos humanos y el establecimiento paralelo de obligaciones del Estado, que incluyen la adopción de determinadas políticas públicas. La idea central que ha presidido el enfoque de la investigación desde su planteamiento es la de que todos los mecanismos jurídicos elegidos para abordar los fenómenos de violencia colectiva deben ser sometidos a un triple análisis científico en los ámbitos psicológico, sociológico y jurídico, para comprobar que producen en la víctima concreta el efecto reparador que se les atribuye, y no, en cambio, efectos distintos o incluso contrarios; que promueven en el cuerpo social al que van dirigidos los efectos de reconciliación, reconstrucción del tejido social y superación del pasado conflictivo; y que contribuyen a la construcción de un Estado democrático basado en el respeto de los derechos humanos. Todo sistema de justicia de transición debería ser pensado como el resultado de una ponderación entre los múltiples intereses individuales y colectivos en juego, y no deben perderse de vista las consecuencias que un determinado mecanismo tendrá para el ordenamiento jurídico en su conjunto y para el modelo de Estado.<br>

  Author(s) Ahmed Anya<br>
  Abstract: I premised at the outset that the idea of community is often romantic and utopian, idealising and evoking a bygone age. Often considered to have been ‘lost’ through modernity, community has also been hailed as the solution to social ‘problems’ by successive governments in the UK. From the New Right to the present Conservative-led coalition government, community has become synonymous with a relinquishment of responsibility by the state (Hoggett et al, 1997). When the women made their move to Spain, community in policy circles was presented by the then government, as a panacea to the lack of social cohesion among<br>

  Abstract: The issue of power is central to neighbourhood planning, yet it is also one of its most contested and debated areas. Implicit (and often explicit) within these debates is the notion of scale. The spatial metaphors that accompany these debates often suggest the idea of power moving up or down a vertical scale between the neighbourhood and a variety of levels of governance (Bailey and Pill, 2014) or horizontally through networked power relations along the lines of collaborative planning (Healey, 1987; Gallant and Robinson, 2012).

The negative cosmopolitanisms of this book have little resemblance to the form envisioned by the Enlightenment tradition. The halcyon days of a cosmopolitanism focused on building universal institutions in order to enable world citizenship have run their course. In<br>

Il confine è, certo, una linea di demarcazione, ma è anche un cum, una linea condivisa: non è necessariamente una barriera, ma è anche vicinanza, linea di passaggio.

In Sils-Maria, “6,000 feet beyond people and time,” on his daily walk around Silvaplana Lake, Nietzsche “stopped near Surlei by a huge, pyramidal boulder”—the rock of the eternal return—where the thought came to him (EH Z 1).

  Abstract: Feminist criticism frequently employs metaphors of space to interrogate the position of women within society and their ability to articulate that position to a wider world. The idea of ‘clearing a space’ from which to speak suggests that for women freedom of expression can only be achieved in ‘empty’ space, space that is unmarked by ideological and aesthetic convictions. Yet such emptiness is impossible, since the speaking self must be meaningfully located. Space, both public and private, is closely related to the construction of identity and to its textual representation. This chapter examines the representation of the house by two<br>

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed? Banki shows that if today we cannot simply escape the "worldwidization" of forgiveness, then it is necessary to rethink what forgiveness is, the conditions under which it supposedly takes place, and especially its relation to justice.<br>

She identifies such a binding as chrononormativity, “the use of time to organize individual human bodies toward maximum productivity.”¹ Under a modern capitalist system, for example, a normal “workday” is arranged (including “free” time) in such a way that workers produce more labor, and thus capital, for their employers. Chrononormativity, therefore, produces the most benefit for those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy.<br>

These issues include his origin—his own “secret stem,” leading back to Russian Romanticism—as well as translation as a vehicle for expressing Nabokov’s own strongly held ideas about art. While Nabokov’s practice of translation undergoes significant changes in the course of his career, his adherence to the idea of some “true,” “metaphysical” language—ever elusive and ever present—remains surprisingly constant.<br>

                  #minor) in m. 8. The transition (TR) then begins immediately (m. 9), opening with a restatement of the P idea on the subdominant E minor and continuing in a normative fashion. The rhetoric suggests tonal and motivic dissolution—as would be expected in a sonata transition<br>

But the most important clue to Eco’s thinking while he composed this difficult work is infrequently cited by his critics. It is a theoretical introduction to a collection of Italian essays on esoteric interpretations of Dante from the nineteenth century–L’idea deforme: interpretazioni esoteriche di Dante(1989,The Distorted Idea: Esoteric Interpretations of Dante)–research carried out by Eco’s students in a seminar<br>

  Book Title: In Praise of Heteronomy-Making Room for Revelation<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
  Abstract: Recognizing the essential heteronomy of postmodern philosophy of religion, Merold Westphal argues against the assumption that human reason is universal, neutral, and devoid of presupposition. Instead, Westphal contends that any philosophy is a matter of faith and the philosophical encounter with theology arises from the very act of thinking. Relying on the work of Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel, Westphal discovers that their theologies render them mutually incompatible and their claims to be the voice of autonomous and universal reason look dubious. Westphal grapples with this plural nature of human thought in the philosophy of religion and he forwards the idea that any appeal to the divine must rest on a historical and phenomenological analysis.<br>

  Abstract: What are the foundations of human self-understanding and the value of responsible philosophical questioning? Focusing on Heidegger's early work on facticity, historicity, and the phenomenological hermeneutics of factical-historical life, Hans-Helmuth Gander develops an idea of understanding that reflects our connection with the world and other, and thus invites deep consideration of phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He draws usefully on Husserl's phenomenology and provides grounds for exchange with Descartes, Dilthey, Nietzsche, Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Foucault. On the way to developing a contemporary hermeneutical philosophy, Gander clarifies the human relation to self in and through conversation with Heidegger's early hermeneutics. Questions about reading and writing then follow as these are the very actions that structure human self-understanding and world understanding.<br>

A partir de la demostración de que sí hubo una política conmemorativa durante este periodo —más o menos orquestada según las circunstancias y el lugar de ejecución—, se analiza qué papel y qué significados se le fueron asignando a la idea de nación en estos actos rituales de la política, si la nación actuó o no como vehículo cohesionador entre los diferentes republicanismos de aquellos años y en qué medida este mecanismo cultural de la política pudo haber contribuido a la formación y socialización de esa idea de España como nación republicana.<br>

Thus the invention of rhetoric was attributed either to Hermes—the god of crossroads and highways, of movement, passage, of communication in all senses of the term—or, as we have seen, to Homer, and finally to three men of the fifth century b.c., Empedokles, Korax, and Tisias.<br>

However, there are now many well-documented examples of successful management of open-access resources, and experiments in ‘co-management’ by users, owners, and government officials. The idea that the government should intervene to remedy the defects of common property, perhaps by registration, is now contested by a celebration of indigenous systems of self-management (Bromley 1989, Bromley and Cernea 1989). Government intervention may sometimes make things worse. Common property claims are also part of indigenous peoples’ defence and reaffirmation of political sovereignty.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Abstract: The utopian idea that progress in human affairs is automatic and unbroken was perhaps the biggest mistake made by early modern proponents of progress, according to Bernard Lonergan.¹ In his view these theorists failed to account for slowdowns and breakdowns, particularly those caused by sin and evil. Accompanying the many positive contributions of modernity to the natural and human sciences came an arrogance that believed that human intelligence at the service of personal egoism was the sufficient engine for progress, and human sin was what transforms an ordinary, unimportant person into a unique, free-thinking individual.² Modern liberals thus were aware<br>

As I will argue, however, effect is highly context-dependent and goes beyond the purely molecular level of the individual body. The relevance of this realm of beyond is the central point of this essay and is something I call embodied molecules. The idea of exploring effect more carefully was triggered<br>

  Abstract: In a famous exchange about the time Canadians were examining the idea of official multiculturalism, two leading theorists – conservative US philosopher Leo Strauss and left-leaning French philosopher Alexandre Kojève – debated about what it took to produce wise and good government in a modern state. Strauss wrestled with the question of the sovereign individual and whether one can remain authentic while living in a society – can he or she live happily ever after? Strauss starts always with the desires of the individual in discussing freedom and tyranny. He sees a “crisis in modernity” because neither the individual nor the state knows<br>

  Book Title: Truth Matters-Knowledge, Politics, Ethics, Religion<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Shuker Ronnie<br>
  Abstract: Why should we seek and tell the truth? Does anyone know what truth is? Many are skeptical about the relevance of truth. Truth Matters endeavours to show why truth is important in a world where the very idea of truth is contested. Putting philosophers in conversation with educators, literary scholars, physicists, political theorists, and theologians, Truth Matters ranges across both analytic and continental philosophy and draws on the ideas of thinkers such as Aquinas, Balthasar, Brandom, Davidson, Dooyeweerd, Gadamer, Habermas, Kierkegaard, Plantinga, Ricoeur, and Wolterstorff. Some essays attempt to provide a systematic account of truth, while others wrestle with the question of how truth is told and what it means to live truthfully. Contributors address debates between realists and anti-realists, explore issues surrounding relativism and constructivism in education and the social sciences, examine the politics of truth telling and the ethics of authenticity, and consider various religious perspectives on truth. Most scholars agree that truth is propositional, being expressed in statements that are subject to proof or disproof. This book goes a step farther: yes, propositional truth is important, but truth is more than propositional. To recognize how it is more than propositional is crucial for understanding why truth truly matters.

  Abstract: About two hundred years ago, the idea that truth was made rather than found began to take hold of the imagination of Europe. The French Revolution had shown that the whole vocabulary of social relations, and the whole spectrum of social institutions, could be replaced almost overnight. This precedent made Utopian politics the rule rather than the exception among intellectuals.

Although the idea of a circle summons up the idea of a fallacy to be avoided, at bottom it rests upon a logical basis: the demand for coherence, that is, for understanding the particular only in the context [Zusammenhang] of the whole to which it belongs.

Abstract Expressionism has become synonymous with a reluctance to explain, and that reluctance has become associated with the assumption that it is irrelevant to discuss meaning as the relation between form and subject matter. The idea that explication is antithetical to Abstract Expressionist art was generated in part by critics who took artists at their word.

  Book Title: Passage to Modernity-An Essay on the Hermeneutics of Nature and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Dupré Louis<br>
  Abstract: Did modernity begin with the Renaissance and end with post-modernity? In this book a distinguished scholar challenges both these assumptions. Louis Dupré discusses the roots, development, and impact of modern thought, tracing the fundamental principles of modernity to the late fourteenth century and affirming that modernity is still an influential force in contemporary culture.The combination of late medieval theology and early Italian humanism shattered the traditional synthesis that had united cosmic, human, and transcendent components in a comprehensive idea of nature. Early Italian humanism transformed the traditional worldview by its unprecedented emphasis on human creativity. The person emerged as the sole source of meaning while nature was reduced to an object and transcendence withdrew into a "supernatural" realm. Dupré analyzes this fragmentation as well as the writings of those who reacted against it-philosophers like Cusanus and Bruno, humanists like Ficino and Erasmus, theologians like Baius and Jansenius, mystics like Ignatius Loyola and Francis de Sales, and theosophists like Weigel and Boehme.Baroque culture briefly reunited the human, cosmic, and transcendent components, but since that time the disintegrating forces have increased in strength. Despite post-modern criticism, the principles of early modernity continue to dominate the climate of our time.
      Passage to Modernityis not so much a critique as a search for the philosophical meaning of the epochal change achieved by those principles.<br>

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  Author(s) Rhoads David<br>
  Abstract: Since William Wrede’s classic study on concealment in the Gospels (1901 [1971]), narrative and secrecy are thought to be close allies in the Gospels of Mark and also John.
                  Messiasgeheimniswas the code he had invented to get a significant matter into perspective. To him the term suggested a theological idea that exercised controlling influence on Mark’s narrative, relegating it toDogmengeschichte(1901, 131). Today few will give unqualified assent to the term “messianic secret,” and fewer still subscribe to Wrede’s explanation of its functioning. But the alliance of Mark’s narrative with secrecy is not in doubt, and the debate<br>

  Book Title: Translating Life-Studies in Transpositional Aesthetics<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): STEAD ALISTAIR<br>
  Abstract: This volume brings together eighteen substantial essays by distinguished scholars, critics and translators, and two interviews with eminent figures of British theatre, to explore the idea and practice of translation. The individual, but conceptually related, contributions examine topics from the Renaissance to the present in the context of apt exploration of the translation process, invoking both restricted and extended senses of translation. The endeavour is to study in detail the theory, workings and implications of what might be called the art of creative transposition, effective at the level of interlingual transcoding, dynamic rewriting, theatrical and cinematic adaptation, intersemiotic or intermedial translation, and cultural exchange. Many of the essays focus on aspects of intertextuality, the dialogue with text, past and present, as they bear on the issue of translation, attending to the historical, political or cultural dimensions of the practice, whether it illuminates a gendered reading of a text or a staging of cultural difference. The historic and generic range of the discussions is wide, encompassing the Elizabethan epyllion, Sensibility fiction, Victorian poetry and prose, modern and postmodern novels, but the book is dominated by dramatic or performance-related applications, with major representation of fresh investigations into Shakespeare (from A Midsummer Night’s Dream to The Tempest) and foregrounding of acts of self-translation on stage, in the dramatic monologue and in fiction. Contributions from theatre practitioners such as Sir Peter Hall, John Barton and Peter Lichtenfels underscore the immense practical importance of the translator on the stage and the business of both acting and directing as a species of translation.<br>

  Author(s) Batty Mark<br>
  Abstract: Any artistic production inevitably involves an act of translation, a transference of a form, commodity, or idea across a boundary, be that boundary one of time, space, language, or cultural medium. Shakespeare and his works are among the most durable and flexible of translated media, and seem unlikely to be easily exhausted. Particularly interesting are the ways in which ‘Shakespeare’ operates both as an enabling medium and as an object who is himself translated. Within the economy of translation, the facilitating medium is a common point of reference, a shared experience which first makes conceivable the possibility and desirability of<br>

  Abstract: Emil Fackenheim cites with approval Elie Wiesel’s statement that the ‘Holocaust destroyed not only human beings but also the idea of humanity’.¹ The evaluation of this claim, which raises the question of the very possibility of ethics after Auschwitz, rests upon a prior assessment of the relation of the Holocaust to modernity. In a nutshell, does the Holocaust represent an appalling ‘hiatus’ in the ongoing progress of modernity, or the disclosure of its essential nihilism? Do we still dwell in the shadow of Auschwitz or is it now possible to ‘actively forget’ and move on? My aim in this paper<br>

  Abstract: Of all the major English poets, Rochester is the most irrepressibly disruptive. The very idea of the anarchic libertine poet, as created in the gossip of his contemporaries and in the notoriety of unpublishably obscene texts, disrupts any attempt to account for his writings from within the institutions and procedures of the Academy. To submit Rochester to scholarship is to effect an even starker juxtaposition of a poet’s emotion and its eventual recollection into the tranquillity of footnotes than that of Yeats’s ‘The Scholars’:<br>

  Abstract: Implicit in the idea of world-making are the assumptions that human beings are the makers of their own history and that in the incessant shaping of their socio-historical worlds they experience some sort of commonality. This dual presupposition entails the attribution of at least some sort of control to both individuals and emerging collectivities over the status and direction of socio-historical institutions and life-trajectories. The allegedly ‘common’ world, emerging and/or persisting in time, poses a number of theoretical problems, of which this chapter attempts to examine only those relating to its creation and constitution.

Where does the former start and where does the latter stop? There are of course objective geographical facts and undeniable ethnic markers to corroborate the idea that Africa and Europe are distinct entities with neatly defined boundaries.

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

                  toposas the focus for the understanding of the human, the understanding of world, and the understanding of the philosophical. Although the idea is not indebted solely to Heidegger’s thinking (it also draws, most notably, on the work of Donald Davidson and Hans-Georg Gadamer), it is probably to Heidegger that it owes the most. Moreover, one of my claims (a claim that underpins many of the essays here) is that Heidegger’s own work cannot adequately be understood except<br>

The traditional understandings of corruption, used in law—corruption as the breach of duty, corruption as the quid pro quo transaction, corruption as illegality or inequality, and so on—capture parts of this idea, but not all. Animating these technical and rational understandings in spirit and practice is another, quite incommensurable concept. Corruption, under this deeper (and popular) understanding, is a raw moral idea. It invokes ideas of ʺdepravityʺ and ʺevil,ʺ human frailty and temptation. It is the capture of individuals and political systems<br>

  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come.

This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time.

Korea was no exception.

  Author(s) Sautter Ulrich<br>
  Abstract: In “The Interpretation of Philosophical Texts,” Nicholas Rescher outlines a coherentist theory of textual interpretation. At the heart of his theory lies an idea that he calls the “Principle of Normativity,” according to which “the better (the more smoothly and coherently) an interpretation fits a text into its wider context, the better it is as an interpretation.” The principle implies that, as Rescher puts it, interpretations are not “born equal.” Although there can be several initially plausible interpretations of a given passage, these interpretations can be evaluated according to the degree to which they maximize contextual coherence. This insight underlies<br>

My intention in this chapter, therefore, cannnot be to provide a comprehensive review of this vast and subtle body of work. Rather, I want tentatively to explicate one aspect of his vision, the idea of

  Abstract: The followers of Pythagoras introduced us to a sacramental dimension of the ancient concept of the symbol. The secretive tradition that grew up around the Presocratic philosopher’s legend employed his “symbols,” the short epigrammatic sayings attributed to him, as tokens of true identity and as a kind of catechism in a ritualized ascent to knowledge. They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

The invasion of those sciences by alien and inappropriate modes of thought has conduced toward the destruction of their distinctiveness, their autonomy, their effectiveness, and their relevance.<br>

He also took two momentous steps toward turning mimesis into the backdrop for an entire philosophy of art.

It is undoubtedly an important key to musical signification, and it has been taken up by a number of writers (for example, Kofi Agawu 1991, and Elaine Sisman 1993). Of course, the idea that music should be appropriate to its subject, either in the setting of words or in the instrumental portrayal of scenes, is universal.

Yet, Nietzschean affirmation takes shape in the resistance to Schopenhauer’s conclusion that the denial of life is the ultimate human response to this condition and that such denial—exemplified in the saint—is definitive of holiness.

  Abstract: Adam Seligman, one of our most important social thinkers, continues the incisive critique of modernity he began in his previously acclaimed

Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

As a form of relational spatialization, however, it incorporates the opposing dimensions of the homonym routes/roots. Traveling is a concept that depends upon the notion of stasis to be comprehensible. Routes are pathways between here and there, two points of rootedness. Identity often requires some form of displacement—literal or figurative—to come to consciousness. Leaving home brings into being the idea of “home,” the perception of its identity as<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

Thus Roman law was based on a distinction between free persons and slaves. Slaves were considered to be “in the power” of their owners: they had no legal personality at all (

Brotherhood is probably an equally ancient notion—certainly brotherhoods are found in many traditional societies—but while the language of fraternity persists into our day, the idea has attracted only occasional scrutiny by Christian thinkers and virtually none by secular theorists.

Transdisciplinarity is a dynamic process, not a static event, and it is one which will continue to need increasingly deep, broad, and diverse contributions. Transdisciplinarity is an idea whose time has come and one whose time will remain.<br>

  Abstract: With the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the idea of human rights came into its own on the world stage. More than anything, the Declaration was a response to the Holocaust, to both its perpetrators and the failure of the rest of the world adequately to come to the aid of its victims. Since that year, however, we have seen many more cases of mass murder. Think of China, Bali, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and now Darfur.

  Author(s) Darby Tom<br>
  Abstract: In the first section of this paper I will explain the necessity of posing the problem of nihilism differently from the way Nietzsche posed it. In the second section I elaborate on the idea that the philosophy of subjectivity—which is closely woven with the phenomenon of nihilism—is an attempt by Western thinking to compensate for the unhomeliness (Unheimlichkeit) of the world by means of a forced quest within oneself. In doing this I extend the old idea of philosophy as a spiritual midwife towards a general understanding of the subject as the centre of a will of exertions,<br>

Pulos has demonstrated, sufficiently a Humean sceptic to question the very idea of causality, finding the only empirical evidence for it in the associational workings of the human mind.²<br>

Generally, critics writing about Bishop have used the question of time to buttress arguments about the “mind thinking”: the notion that Bishop’s goal is to capture the feeling of a mind in the process of working out a thought rather than a mind relating a fully formed idea.

Globalization easily risks becoming a cliché as different people use and misuse it for their purposes. The most common interpretation of globalization is the idea that the world is becoming more uniform, homogenized, standardized, and compressed through a technological, commercial, and cultural synchronization emanating from the West.

  Abstract: Editors’ Note: Stanton wrote this piece for theNorth American Reviewas a spirited response to Flora McDonald Thompson’s “Retrogression of the American Woman,” which had been published by the Review the previous month in November 1900. Stanton continued her long debate with conservative religious women about modern progress and its benefits for women. Stanton herself in previous writings had made use of the argument that women were morally superior than men, but in this article, she ridiculed the idea that women’s superiority required their confinement to the domestic realm or restricting their access to higher education.<br>

  Book Title: Saul Bass-Anatomy of Film Design<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Horak Jan-Christopher<br>
  Abstract: Iconic graphic designer and Academy Award--winning filmmaker Saul Bass (1920--1996) defined an innovative era in cinema. His title sequences for films such as Otto Preminger's The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) and Anatomy of a Murder (1959), Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) and North by Northwest (1959), and Billy Wilder's The Seven Year Itch (1955) introduced the idea that opening credits could tell a story, setting the mood for the movie to follow. Bass's stylistic influence can be seen in popular Hollywood franchises from the Pink Panther to James Bond, as well as in more contemporary works such as Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and television's Mad Men.<br>

  Abstract: Bauhaus and Gestalt aesthetics influenced Saul Bass’s art, nowhere more visibly than in his film posters, which often reduced a film’s narrative content to a single iconic image. The designer’s later reputation as a creator of pithy corporate logos provides a clue to his method: Bass had an extreme talent for capturing the essence of a film’s narrative in a single abstract, highly iconographic image; this image, through its metonymic quality, would then become the central visual idea or logo for an advertising campaign. Most historians credit Bass as being the inventor of the film logo, which “is the figurative<br>

  Abstract: Chapter 6 examined the arguments for content externalism and an essentially defensive reaction to those arguments – a reaction that is Cartesian in spirit – based on the dual component theory, along with the associated idea of the mental state narrowly individuated. It was argued that this Cartesian reaction to the arguments for externalism faces serious difficulties. Nonetheless, we have not yet worked out the implications of the arguments themselves. If an essentially Cartesian strategy to limit their scope does not work, we have, as yet, done nothing to work out what that scope is. This is the task of this chapter.<br>

  Abstract: Over the past generation, performance studies has largely transformed how we think about the contemporary stage, expanding our idea of serious theatre to include such “lowbrow” forms as mixed media, vaudeville, and monologue.¹ The “happenings” of the 1960s and 1970s serve as the immediate precursor to much contemporary art, as more distantly do the Dadaist and surrealist exhibitions of the 1910s and 1920s. These avant-garde beginnings are notable because, like the performance artists of today, the Dadaists and surrealists challenged the idea that life and art are distinct and autonomous spheres, unambiguously separated by a stage proscenium.² Yet, as we<br>

How people conceptualize the phenomenon, however, varies considerably not only from society to society, but also from individual to individual.

  Abstract: Representations of war are determined not only by the ages in which they appear, but also by the boundaries understood to define war. The idea, for example, that it is not battle but war itself that leaves behind scars presumes that war has both a beginning and an end, or that we can differentiate between the event and its traces. War is, however, an extended process, one that can hardly be isolated or made wholly distinct from peace. The vagueness of the concept suggests that much remains unknown about its limits.

  Abstract: The history of the term ‘avant-garde’ in Europe has been thoroughly documented by various continental scholars with no substantial disagreements about the early development and uses of the term.¹ The idea of an avant-garde was first coined in fifteenth-century France to describe the military unit at the fore of the army – the avant-garde was the group that defended the country and all it represented, and that, upon successful defence, pushed forth into new territory. The avant-garde used violence to protect and enlarge a nation’s territorial holdings. From this militaristic and nationalistic root, the term avant-garde transitioned from a literal implication<br>

As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

The Conquerors’ towns (

  Abstract: Reflections on the relationships between one period of philosophy and another raise important methodological issues which first emerge in their modern form in the wake of Kant, Herder and other thinkers in the second half of the eighteenth century. This is the period in which the ramifications of the idea that philosophy is bound up with the historical circumstances of its production begin to be apparent. In the light of these ramifications, the apparently obvious aim of identifying anticipations or echoes of twentieth-century forms of philosophy in the nineteenth century is by no means as straightforward as it might at<br>

  Abstract: The tradition I sketched in the run-up to my discussion of ‘The Idea of Order at Key West’, that of identifying a spark or charge in poetic language, is sometimes manifested in psychologistic forms in the twentieth century: the energy expressing itself in poetic language is not that of a divine ordering spirit, nor the character of a people, nor a latent ‘chemical’ power in the language itself, but in the psyche of the poet concerned. The surrealist and poet André Breton thought this way. Adopting the language of the poet-critic Pierre Reverdy, who said that one ‘creates … a<br>

  Abstract: The idea of creativity or creative writing as a research method may seem a contradiction in terms. Long-held beliefs about the nature of creativity identify it as something that is outside or beyond methodical thought. Plato presented his philosopher, Socrates, as charmed by poets, but sceptical about the latters’ capacity to be governed by reason: ‘a poet is a light and winged thing and holy, and never able to compose until he has become inspired, and is beside himself, and reason is no longer in him’.¹ Romanticism is often taken to reinforce these beliefs in its account of the poet<br>

  Author(s) Stockwell Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Over the last twenty years deliberative democracy has become the most discussed theory of democracy. The term was coined by Joseph Bessette in 1980, but academic writing on deliberative democracy really picked up in the early 1990s (Bessette 1980; Hansen 2004). While the idea of giving deliberation a core role in democracy has roots throughout the history of democracy, the most important contemporary theoretical sources for deliberative democrats are the works of Jürgen Habermas and John Rawls (Habermas 1984, 1989, 1996; Rawls 1971, 1996). The theory of deliberative democracy is often directed at two related deficiencies of actual existing democracy,<br>

  Author(s) Boucher David<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary political theory has never been comfortable with the idea of evil. Indeed, the gradual, sporadic, but nevertheless incomplete secularisation of political discourse since the Renaissance has made the conceptualisation of absolute value deeply problematic. One response, dominant in the liberal tradition, is simply to deny that politics is the realm of absolute value at all. The pragmatic adjustment of competing interests in a scheme of social co-operation invites, at the very least, a moderation of tone. And increasing empirical awareness of the diversity of different schemes of (merely political) co-operation has made us (rightly) guarded in the language we<br>

  Abstract: The idea of silent Shakespeare strikes many as oxymoronic. In its muting of Shakespearean drama, silent Shakespearean cinema robs its inherited source of that which most frequently, and perhaps most crucially, has been taken to define it. In effect, the collaboration of this dramatic material with this medium of expression can be read as a liaison of naturally antithetical forces: one imaginatively evokes the image through the suggestive power of the poetically employed word, the other does not just erode the power of the word in its privileging of the image, but all but ousts words from its performance space.<br>

The millennial moment in Britain and beyond, was not the dawn of the year 2000 but the death of the Princess of Wales – discussed in Chapter 5. Sinclair is here working with the idea of affect and with an emotional moment; one that expresses the finality, transition and mourning that might be associated with an endpoint, even though the media mood for the millennial shift itself was unremittingly celebratory.

  Abstract: The previous chapters open a set of questions about the relationship between time and self-consciousness, an axis which has received too little attention within literary studies.¹ This neglect is all the more surprising since the idea of self-consciousness itself has played such a central role in the characterisation not only of contemporary fiction but of the more general social and discursive condition of the contemporary world. In prolepsis, we find on one hand a kind of temporal self-distance – a form of reflection which involves looking back on the present, from one’s own point of view or that of another – and<br>

It is easy to state that the mind is shaped wholly by a combination of neurophysical parameters and social experience, but the very fact that one feels so resistant to this idea shows the merits of deeper examination.

Indeed, a wide variety of disciplines from grammar to comparative linguistics have now entered into the metaphor debate. In contrast to this loose<br>

  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

A foundational argument here is Roman Ingarden’s discussion of temporal perspective in

  Book Title: Regional Modernisms-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moran James<br>
  Abstract: Where did literary modernism happen? In this book, a range of scholars seek to answer this question, re-evaluating the parameters of modernism in the light of recent developments in literary geography as well as literary history, examining an array of different literary forms including novels, poetry, theatre, and ‘little magazines’. The volume identifies and appraises the local attachments of modernist texts in particular geographical regions and also interrogates the idea of the 'regional' in light of the alienating displacements of transnational modernity. The essays collected here make fresh interventions in the field of modernist studies and acknowledge the legacies of regional modernisms for post-war representations of place and landscape. Individual essays discuss canonical figures (W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence) as well as more marginal or lesser-known writers (Dylan Thomas, Hugh MacDiarmid, J. M.

By focusing on a theory’s internal structure as an assemblage of political concepts, this book conceptualizes theories as theoretical constructions, a form of idea entity, and moreover, a form of political thought: a configuration of decontested political concepts arranged together, each conferring meaning on the others and receiving meaning from them.

  Publisher: Editorial A Contracorriente<br>
  Author(s): Lopera Alejandro Sánchez<br>
  Abstract: Este libro busca intervenir en el debate sobre formas del pensamiento latinoamericano, mas alla de la historia de las ideas, el poscolonialismo/decolonialismo, y la filosofia de la liberacion. Utiliza la literatura de Jose Revueltas (Mexico, 1914-1976) y Roberto Bolano (Chile, 1953-2003) para pensar filosoficamente a America Latina, e interrogar modos de la experiencia ilegibles desde coordenadas liberales y humanistas. Se trata de pensar con Revueltas y Bolano, antes que pensar a Revueltas y Bolano. Por eso, la trama del libro se desarrolla a partir del analisis antimoralista de tres episodios: la Revolucion Mexicana; las revueltas de 1968 en Mexico, y el golpe militar en Chile en 1973. Esto permite trazar otra imagen de America Latina por fuera de la victimizacion, la autocompasion o la autoindulgencia. Y abrir el pensamiento latinoamericano a lo generico, lejos de la idea de originalidad, deficit o negatividad frente al pensamiento europeo o norteamericano.<br>

                  113) to the uncovering of an indigenous philosophical problematic. All of this derives, at the end of the day, from Lévi-Strauss himself, and I think that he knew it perfectly well. That South American affinity is indeed not a sociological category but a philosophical idea was something Lévi-Strauss had observed in a premonitory way in one of his very first works,<br>

It was also a given, however, that the American taking a trip to the Continent in order to seek sensual and cultural pleasures (often referred to as “the grand tour”) was male.¹ There were definitely flesh-and-blood counterparts to Henry James’s wealthy heiresses and Ernest Hemingway’s bohemian heroines, but these tended to be the exception not the rule, and it wasn’t until the early 1950s that the dream of fulfilling one’s desires while traveling or living abroad finally<br>

  Abstract: If an aporia is defined as a problem or difficulty arising from an awareness of opposing or incompatible views on the same theoretic matter, it seems to me that we have reached an aporetic stage in the postcolonial quest for nation building. The very practices that produce the nation are coeval with its simultaneous fragmentation or unraveling. Although the supposedly progressive and universal idea of the nation is expected to eventually triumph over the reactionary and particularist idea denoted as ethnicity, a close look at the practices of nation building reveal that both nation and ethnicity share a logic that<br>

All but the most radical critics of engagement advocate policies that are geared toward avoiding either a direct military conflict with or a sudden collapse of North Korea.

Just as artists, scientists, and philosophers of the twentieth century tried to integrate time into thought, they also attempted to affirm the inescapability of finitude.

  Book Title: Milton and the Rabbis-Hebraism, Hellenism, and Christianity<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Shoulson Jeffrey S.<br>
  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

The events of the past, both distant and more recent, posed a special challenge to the rabbis and Milton. With few exceptions, these events marked painful losses: the destruction of the Temple and the ensuing loss of political power within the Roman Empire on the one hand, the Restoration of the English monarchy and the disempowerment of more radical embodiments of Protestantism on the other.

  Abstract: Popularized by a novel by Henri Murger in 1846,¹ then consecrated by Puccini in his famous opera, the idea of Bohemia, in its current use, implies a lifestyle and a particular attitude toward aesthetics. Rejection of bourgeois conventions, lack (or voluntary renunciation) of a fixed abode and regular work, frequent visits to cafés, cabarets, and popular taverns, a taste for nocturnal life, ostentatious sexual freedom, a keen penchant for alcohol and drugs, the fair communal share of meager available resources, and even, at times, a certain “sectarianism” colored by the use of secret codes shared only by a select brotherhood<br>

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

  Abstract: Samuel P.Huntington’s idea of the “third wave” of democ ratization has been remarkably influential and continues to figure importantly in democracy studies today. Ironically, by 1993, Huntington had already shifted his attention from the third wave to the clash of civilizations. In his 1991 article “Religion and the Third Wave,” Huntington suggests a causal relationship between Christianity and democracy that anticipates his much-debated thesis of 1993.¹ In his book

  Book Title: Eating Beauty-The Eucharist and the Spiritual Arts of the Middle Ages<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): ASTELL ANN W.<br>
  Abstract: Reading the lives of the saints not primarily as historical documents but as iconic expressions of original artworks fashioned by the eucharistic Christ, Astell puts the "faceless" Host in a dynamic relationship with these icons. With the advent of each new spirituality, the Christian idea of beauty expanded to include, first, the marred beauty of the saint and, finally, that of the church torn by division-an anti-aesthetic beauty embracing process, suffering, deformity, and disappearance, as well as the radiant lightness of the resurrected body. This astonishing work of intellectual and religious history is illustrated with telling artistic examples ranging from medieval manuscript illuminations to sculptures by Michelangelo and paintings by Salvador Dalí. Astell puts the lives of medieval saints in conversation with modern philosophers as disparate as Simone Weil and G. W. F. Hegel.<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the
      Mnemosyne-Atlascomplicates any linear narrative of its themes and contents, Christopher D. Johnson traces several thematic sequences in the panels. By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>

  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Book Title: Expressing Identities in the Basque Arena-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

  Abstract: La alegoría pictórica o retórica clásica (si se trata de una personificación) se concibe como una imagen concreta, “corporal”, que vehicula, re-presenta o encarna convencionalmente un concepto superior y universal; una imagen que ilustra una idea sin confundirse con ella. Se compone de varios elementos “simbólicos” o emblemas que pueden combinarse de diversas maneras. La organización de los datos visuales suscita en el espectador un esfuerzo interpretativo semejante al que implica la lectura de un relato; es decir, la imagen alegórica clásica lo invita a reconstituir una secuencia (eventualmente narrativa) de acciones o eventos (cf.

  Book Title: Love and Death in Goethe-`One and Double'<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Dye Ellis<br>
  Abstract: Goethe, in association with his younger Romantic compatriots the Schlegels, Novalis, Fichte, and Schelling, struggled with the subject-object dichotomy, and tried to bridge the gap between self and other, consciousness and nature. His theory and practice prefigured the Romantics' determination to display and interrogate the linguistic and cultural structures informing their own thinking and modes of representation--what Goethe calls one's "Vorstellungsart." His work exploits, subverts, and supplants inherited conventions and signs, demonstrating with virtuosic irony that literature is a system of texts, pre-texts, and pre-established but dynamic conceptual models. 'Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double"' explores Goethe's use, in a wide range of his poetry and prose, of the theme of 'Liebestod' (love and death) and related embodiments of the paradox of unity in duality. Ellis Dye also examines Goethe's use of other themes related to love and death--the 'femme fatale', the 'vagina dentata, Frau Welt', the Lorelei, venereal disease, the 'Lustmord' --and considers issues of selfhood and individuation as well as the possibility that the love-death theme contains an implicit gender bias toward the existential fact of personal separateness. Poems, plays, and novels are dealt with, nevertheless, as works of art, not only as illustrations of an idea or as points of intersection in a system of rhetorical conventions, and are examined for intellectual cohesiveness, elegance, and integrity of design as well as special meanings and effects. ' Love and Death in Goethe:"One and Double" ' explores the meaning of the central theme of Romantic poetry in the works of the most important Romantic poet of all. Students of literary culture, both the lay reader and the Goethe specialist, will be enlightened by its approach and find pleasure and instruction in its revelations. Robert Ellis Dye is professor of German at Macalester College.<br>

  Book Title: Fighting For Time-Shifting Boundaries of Work and Social Life<br>
  Publisher: Russell Sage Foundation<br>
  Author(s): Kalleberg Arne L.<br>
  Abstract: Though there are still just twenty-four hours in a day, society’s idea of who should be doing what and when has shifted. Time, the ultimate scarce resource, has become an increasingly contested battle zone in American life, with work, family, and personal obligations pulling individuals in conflicting directions. In Fighting for Time, editors Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and Arne Kalleberg bring together a team of distinguished sociologists and management analysts to examine the social construction of time and its importance in American culture. Fighting for Time opens with an exploration of changes in time spent at work—both when people are on the job and the number of hours they spend there—and the consequences of those changes for individuals and families. Contributors Jerry Jacobs and Kathleen Gerson find that the relative constancy of the average workweek in America over the last thirty years hides the fact that blue-collar workers are putting in fewer hours while more educated white-collar workers are putting in more. Rudy Fenwick and Mark Tausig look at the effect of nonstandard schedules on workers’ health and family life. They find that working unconventional hours can increase family stress, but that control over one’s work schedule improves family, social, and health outcomes for workers. The book then turns to an examination of how time influences the organization and control of work. The British insurance company studied by David Collinson and Margaret Collinson is an example of a culture where employees are judged on the number of hours they work rather than on their productivity. There, managers are under intense pressure not to take legally guaranteed parental leave, and clocks are banned from the office walls so that employees will work without regard to the time. In the book’s final section, the contributors examine how time can have different meanings for men and women. Cynthia Fuchs Epstein points out that professional women and stay-at-home fathers fac~<br>

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

Abstract: Patten presents a detailed explication and defense of Hegel’s conception of freedom as rational self‐determination. On such a view, inherited from Kant, being free involves more than the absence of coercion or being able to do as one pleases. Freedom requires actors to self‐legislate their behavior such that the good reasons motivating them override their contingent desires and inclinations. Given standard objections to Kant’s idea of autonomy, and Hegel’s own statements of those objections, Patten carefully analyzes Hegel to demonstrate both that he does in fact hold a related view, and that his view does not fall prey to the same problems as Kant’s. Central to Patten’s interpretation of Hegel is the idea that free agents will be ones who act in ways harmonious with those features of modern life and the modern state that establish the conditions Hegel thinks are necessary for the realization and sustenance of individual freedom.<br>

Abstract: In the seventeenth and eighteenth century, at a time when the idea of eternal punishment loses ground in dogmatic theology, divines insist on keeping it as a tool for the maintenance of moral and social order. See Daniel Pickering Walker,
            The Decline of Hell: Seventeenth‐Century Discussions of Eternal Torment(Chicago, 1964). Something analogous took place for the resurrection. As Bunyan warned, “he that denyeth the Resurrection of the dead, he setteth open a Floud‐gate to all manner of impiety, he cutteth the throat of a truly holy life, and layeth the Reins upon the neck of the most outragious lusts” (Bunyan,The Resurrection of the Dead,p. 214).<br>

Abstract: Michelle Rosaldo’s (
            1982,1973) studies of public speech in the Philippines, at the advent of Western influence, provide one splendid example of such work. Rosaldo argues that the native Ilongots’ traditional, flowery, indirect public speech style implicitly acknowledged their idea that no one person had a singular claim to the truth and that no one could do very much to enforce one version of the truth in a dispute between differing truth claims. When Western imperial powers overshadowed local rulers’ power, the speech style became more direct and forceful. The West brought the idea that there was one universal, single truth, and that there were powerful institutions that could enforce that single truth, even if not everyone accepted it as truth. These new collective representations—new notions of truth, power, and personhood—were inseparable from the change to a more direct, brusque, conflictive, Western style of public discourse.<br>

Abstract: 3. Did I overlook possible points of continuity across paradigms?The answer to this question relates to criteria for establishing continuity. The use of the same term, for example, does not mean that its meaning (extensionally or intensionally) is the same. Thus, Darnells suggestion that we all share ethnography, for example, is appealing, but I am not sure that ethnography means the same for all of those engaged in it, especially as more and more students are encouraged to work in their own communities and engage in urban (or suburban) fieldwork that often forces them to live the contradictions of an alienated native self or of a privileged fieldworker on the way to acquiring a professional multiplepersonality disorder. CookGumperz and Gumperz mention narrative and narrativity. It is difficult for me to see the narratives recorded by Boas as the same thing as the narratives collected and analyzed by Ochs and Capps (2001). They are both texts, but they were produced, recorded, and analyzed in such different ways that their similarities rapidly vanish as we expand the notion of teller to include the work done by participants in the narrative event. Finally, Spitulnik brings up the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis as a possible source of continuity across paradigms. This is the most challenging of the three proposals for a thematic link across paradigms because the SapirWhorf hypothesis has almost mythical proportions in the public imagination. Together with the evolution of language (a topic that most linguists tend to avoid), the SapirWhorf hypothesis is a must in anthropology textbooks and in introductory books on language and culture. But the semanticindeterminacy problem is here even more serious than for ethnography and narrative given that, as Spitulnik knows (see her use of the qualifier socalled), there never was a SapirWhorf hypothesis, unless we take for it Hoijers (1954:93) rarely quoted informal and very general definition: The central idea of the SapirWhor~<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

But Batchelor was very much against the idea of giving the Lucasian professor to Atiyah whom he regarded as a pure mathematician thinly disguised as a physicist. It might have meant that the Lucasian professor was lost from applied mathematics to pure. In the end I agreed to accept if I was given certain support. I must say I like the feeling that I hold the same job as newton and Dirac.<br>

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”
         46In this sense, which is first of all negative, or rather denegatory, man’s incomprehensibility comes under the domain of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Camus outlined his idea of his art and the role of the writer that is resonant with the title of his short story collection,
            Exile and the Kingdom,in his 1957 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, available online (http://www.nobel.se/literature/laureates/1957/camus‐acceptance.html): “[My art] is a means of stirring the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged picture of common joys and sufferings. It obliges the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth.… By definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it. Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art. Not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of men will free him from his isolation, even and particularly if he falls into step with them. But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst of the privileges of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art.”<br>

Abstract: The refusal of rhetorical technique was a standard motif in business‐writing manuals of the period from the 1870s to the 1950s. In addition to George Burton Hotchkiss, Edward Jones Kilduff, and J. Harold Janis,
            Handbook of Business English(1914; New York, 1945), p. 25, quoted in the epigraph, see Philip B. McDonald,English and Science(New York, 1929), p. 1, which begins with a complaint about the “old‐fashioned rhetoric” taught in the schools, which “encourages verbosity and tolerates vague, stilted language.” See also the well‐known rhetoric of John F. Genung,The Practical Elements of Rhetoric(Boston, 1886), p. 13, which acknowledges the mutual exclusivity of information and rhetoric: “Some modes of exhibiting facts, as in statistics, reference‐tables, formulae, and the like, are too rudimentary to admit the idea of style. There can be no degrees of effectiveness in the presentation of them, nor is such effectiveness looked for; their interest centers solely in the thing that is said.” Genung does not yet see the possibility of stylistic choices in the “presentation” of information, noted below in connection with the work of Edward Tufte.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations. Opposing doctrinal formulations are regarded as complementary expressions of a theological truth so profound as to be irreducible to any single formulation. For the ecumenical use of the complementarity concept, see, e.g., Avery Dulles, “Paths to Doctrinal Agreement: Ten Theses,”

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: Where Meyers looks at images, McNay examines theorists: Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler, Paul Ricoeur, and Cornelius Castoriadis. In each case McNay lays out what she takes to be the merits of each writer’s views, while asking how the important step for feminists, from theory to action, is to be taken. And in each case the answer to this question is elusive. This is due in part to internal differences between the writers McNay considers. It is far from clear that Butler’s views on the body inform the same idea of agency as Ricoeur’s theory of narrative, for example, and as the text grows increasingly complex the very concept of agency seems to recede. This elusiveness is also partly due to the critique of theory itself. While striving to preserve the value in each competing view of subjectivity, McNay draws the reader’s attention to such serious drawbacks that one despairs for these theories altogether.<br>

Author(s): Mandry,  Christof<br>
Abstract: Mandry offers a relatively concise and convincing reading of Ricoeur on the ethical self and its relation to ethical aims for the good life and the moral demand for justice. Mandry’s concern is to clarify what is meant by “ethical identity” and how this idea might aid theological ethics. The principle contribution is to show the place of religious conviction (
      Überzeugung) in relation to ethical aims, moral duties, and practical reasoning. Mandry’s contention is that philosophy and theology offer different perspectives on the ethical subject which can fruitfully engage each other. The question then becomes, of course, whether or not the question that provoked the discussion in the first case has simply been pushed back one further step in reflection. What provides the warrant for multiple perspectives on the ethical subject? Is it a philosophical warrant or a theological one?<br>

Date: 09 2005<br>
Author(s): Johar Schueller Malini<br>
Abstract: In
         Bodies That Matter(1993), a book that begins, significantly, with an epigraph from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” (1991), Butler begins to ponder the problems of the analogical model, although race is arguably still added to arguments about gender and sexuality. The bulk of the introduction theorizes the constructedness of “sex” and interrogates the critical assumption of a prior, unmarked category of sex onto which gender is culturally imposed. Instead of constructedness, Butler proposes the notion of matter, a process that “produce[s]the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter” (1993, 9). Sex and the contours of the body, Butler argues, are regulated by the heterosexual imperative. It is only much later in the introduction, after the theorizations of the body, sex, and matter have been made, that Butler introduces, as part of her chapter summaries, the idea that “normative heterosexuality is clearly not the only regulatory regime in the production of bodily contours” (1993, 17). Structurally, that is, body, sex, and matter are constituted as the main items of theory to which race is added. As Butler argues, race is not simply another domain separable from sexual difference, “but … its ‘addition’ subverts the monolithic workings of the heterosexual imperative as I have described it so far” (18). Although Butler is clearly aware of the problems of simply adding race to the understandings of the body and of sex, her own positioning of race in the introduction is nonetheless additive. Yet Butler goes on to suggest a focus on the specificities as well as intersections of race and gender construction: “It seems crucial to resist the model of power that would set up racism and homophobia and misogyny as parallel or analogical relations. The assertion of their abstract or structural equivalence not only misses the specific history of their construction and elaboration, but also delays the important work of thinking through the ways in which thes~<br>

Abstract: Yet while a dialectic of theology of religions and comparative theology can thus provide the most basic modus operandi of solidary interreligious engagement for Christians, the formulation given it so far has been based on a Gadamerian reading of Hegel’s dialectically formulated recognitive process in terms of “fusion of horizons” that is also informed by a Levinasian critique of Hegel in the name of the self’s asymmetrical relation to the infinity of the other’s voice.
         41When left as it is, however, such a reading does not do full justice to the sociopolitically inscribed nature of the recognitive process, insofar as each religious horizon of recognition and evaluation refers to an emergent religious identity that is a site of negotiation and contestation for various social, cultural, and religious identities. Thus, the question here put to the idea of “fusion of horizons” is: which horizons? Similarly, the challenge presented to the notion of the rupture of one’s totalizing horizon by the always emergent, negotiated, and contested voice of a religious other is: which other? The language of “horizon” or “other” must first be given back its sociopolitically concrete and internally heterogeneous meaning if the unifying narrative of identity sought by means of politically intentional hybridization is not to turn out as an instrument of domination suppressing the multiplicity of heterogeneous voices—social, cultural, and religious identities—within each site of religious identity that clamors for recognition.<br>

Abstract: David Tracy examines the tension between literal and metaphorical meaning in Christian religious language in “Metaphor and Religion: The Test Case of Christian Texts,” in
            On Metaphor, ed. Sheldon Sacks (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979), 89–104. Tracy focuses on two basic expressions: “The Kingdom of God is like” and “God is Love.” “The statement ‘God is Love,’” Tracy writes, “does not say literally what God is butproducesa metaphorical meaning for what God is like” (103). Tracy refers to Paul Ricoeur’s insistence on the concept of tension inThe Rule of Metaphor(trans. Robert Czerny [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000], 247–56). Ricoeur speaks of “theecstaticmoment of language,” which is “the moment ofbelief,of ontological commitment” (249). Ricoeur summarizes the idea of “tension” within metaphorical truth as follows: “There is no other way to do justice to the notion of metaphorical truth than to include the critical incision of the (literal) ‘is not’ within the ontological vehemence of the metaphorical ‘is’” (255).<br>

Abstract: Perspective exchange.—The idea that perspective exchange differs from information exchange, as well as the fact that it is essential for interreligious dialogue, crops up only sporadically in the theology of religions. There are three possible reasons: philosophical, civilizational, and religious reasons. Concerning the first reason: following a period of modern subject philosophy and ego psychology the insight in the “other as other,” “the other astotaliter aliter” in postmodern philosophy, has influenced people in such a manner that the simple fact of perspective exchange, as the basis of all relationships and communication of (higher animal species and) people, may have been lost. This is actually depressing, because the concept already has a long history. It emerged for the first time in American pragmatism, specifically in the symbolic interactionism of G. H. Mead.43Since then there has been a lot of research in both developmental and social psychology, and it has become a standard textbook concept.44In the past twenty years we have witnessed intensified interest in this concept, specifically in cognitive science, including cognitive psychology and cognitive anthropology, whether these disciplines use different, traditional, or new terms like role taking, social attribution, empathy, and “theory of the mind.”45According to research in these disciplines, perspective exchange seems to be a natural disposition of (higher animal species and) people; it starts developing at a very young age, and its roots lie in the functioning of the brain. Expressed negatively, the concept refers to the socioemotional disposition that enables people to step out of their own perspective in which they experience and interpret situations, other people, and themselves. It indicates, moreover, their ability to let go of their own desires, preferences, intentions, plans, and expectations. Expressed positively, it is the socioemotional disposition that enables people to switch to the per~<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 298. The field of memory studies is still underdeveloped, although most efforts today are concentrated in the direction of neurobiology. Some research circles have revived the ancient idea of a memory trace, which preserves the information received from experience. Only when there is activation of such a trace does the highly specific causal connection occur that is required for true remembering. Others contest this idea, based on the very little knowledge we have about the physiological processes involving the memory of specific events. They insist that memory is highly dispersed in alternative neural networks rather than encoded in specific brain cells.<br>

Abstract: This creative possibility can be rendered somewhat more concrete by considering an alternative and largely forgotten Jewish and Christian tradition of interpretation of the Genesis myth. This chiefly ancient and medieval tradition reads the
         imago Deias not just something passively received but also a responsibility and a command, precisely, to imitate the Creator: animitatio Dei. According to Martin Buber, rabbinic teaching has frequently understood the Genesis image of God to mean that “following the deity raises itself … to the idea of imitating the deity.”18The most prominent expression of this tradition is the imitation of the Creator on the Sabbath, the imitation of God’s seventh day of peace and rest. The original Sabbath immediately follows, and can be juxtaposed with, the Genesis 1 affirmation of humanity as God’s image. It symbolizes a form of rest that is not just passive but also active, something we must do. But this imitative imperative (if we may call it that) also has a more explicitly moral dimension, Buber claims, because imitating God “is what becoming a blessing for the other peoples means: setting a living example of a true people, a community.”19The avoidance of graven images coincides with Israel functioning as a different kind of moral image for the world. Despite corruption and violence it is nevertheless possible to represent in one’s actions something of humankind’s original capability for peace and fellowship.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In this chapter, Ricoeur displays an artful capacity to inspire the ongoing research on recognition. Many contemporary thinkers have chosen to shun the troubling question of “What is it that must be recognized?” with something akin to an institutional approach: the answer would not lie in discovering the essence of recognition but, instead, in finding a creative approach to the negotiation of recognition claims. This approach is clearly the one preferred in the defense of multiculturalism. For instance, Will Kymlicka emphasizes the design of fair “structures of culture” that are distinguished from substantial “characters of culture” (Will Kymlicka,
      Liberalism, Community, and Culture[New York: Clarendon, 1989], 167). The idea behind this separation of political from more substantive problems is, most of the time, congruent with considerations about the pluralism of worldviews and the public role of philosophy. Yet this approach, however sound it may be, has displaced deep conflicts in the hands of institutional “designs” that are guided by the need for immediate results, which are likely to shade important issues.<br>

Abstract: Three general features of this method can be noted in advance. First, this method must be immanent or internal to its subject matter. Dialectical theorists reject outright the idea that the thinker can occupy some privileged Archimedean point outside the subject of investigation. … A second feature of dialectical method is its dialogical character. Theorizing is an activity taking place not simply within the mind but between minds. Thinking is dialogical because it always takes the form of an exchange or a conversation between ourselves, our contemporaries, and our predecessors. … Third, the dialogical element is related to the historical dimension of theory.

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: What, then, for Derrida, is European responsibility or responsibility as something specifically European? The conflicting exigencies formulated in the foregoing discussion of the concept of responsibility require the invention of a new way in which to renew, revive, or replay the figure, concept, or idea of Europe. European responsibility is, first of all, this openness to
      bothtraditions of responsibility, namely, Platonism and Christianity. It consists in exposure to the radically conflicting demands that these two traditions make upon their heirs as responsible selves. European responsibility is above all the uncompromising willingness to assume the challenge posed by the aporetic nature of inheritance itself—that is, by the constitutive lack of handed‐down rules or norms to negotiate contradiction. Consequently, Europe is the name for a responsibility that also goes hand in hand with the necessity of having to invent, each time anew, new ways of meeting mutually exclusive demands. As a simultaneous responsibility to, at first, two opposite traditions, European responsibility consists in not letting one of the traditions overturn, outplay, or outdo the other. By doing justice to its double heritage, and not shunning the necessity of negotiating conflicting demands in the absence of pregiven norms or rules, such responsibility not only entails a radical refusal of traditionalism, for structural reasons, but also is distinguished by openness to other traditions and demands. Indeed, from the moment that Europe is understood as a responsibility to more than one tradition or set of injunctions, its responsiveness and responsibility extend to all other traditions. Apart from being hospitable to other historically and culturally decisive intra‐European differences (such as Judaism and Islam—not in the abstract, however, but with all their shades and forms), as well as to the many minor, or marginal, differences within Europe, this principal openness that the name E~<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Moral Creativityis also a book about Paul Ricoeur. Throughout, Wall turns to Ricoeur’s philosophical and religious thought for theoretical support, using a wide range of primary and secondary literature. Wall works from a Ricoeurian idea that the self is a synthesis of activity and passivity, freedom and finitude. He finds in this ontology of selfhood a basis for conceiving of creativity as the activity of inventing free action amid the limitations of finitude. This anthropology is then tied to Ricoeur’s work on narrative identity, love, ideology, and other topics. Wall’s exegesis of Ricoeur is accurate and astute, succinctly connecting the thinker’s early and late writings on selfhood. The book faults Ricoeur for having an insufficient sense for the entrenchment of social/cultural injustice and for the radical otherness of other people. The discussion of Ricoeur and Emmanuel Levinas on otherness is one of the most interesting parts of the book but also an argument that might need expansion. Wall laments Ricoeur’s decision to separate philosophy from religious discourse, claiming this was a purely pragmatic decision whereby “Ricoeur ultimately does himself a disservice” (181). This may be so, but regardless of intent, wouldn’t we have to say that such a separation is part of the thought world projected by Ricoeur’s writings? Patching over this separation may bring Ricoeur closer to writers of the current “theological turn” of postmodernism but possibly at the price of losing one of Ricoeur’s great virtues—his usefulness in mediating between postmodernism and the modernity that insists on dividing religion and reason.<br>

In spite of these intrawar announcements of a pervasive presentism, first metabolizing the future and then severing its relationship to it, it was not until the postwar period that the issue was joined in the political world. To be sure, Claude Lévi‐Strauss lamented the passing of older, traditional societies and the bankruptcy of a future assuring endless progress. Undoubtedly, implicit in this critique was a sentiment that advised a forgetting of the future, which merely formed the flipside of a contemporaneous Japanese recommendation of the early 1960s to forget the Enlightenment. By the 1960s this idea had become a worldwide political slogan and defined the necessary condition to return to the present—marking the progressive invasion of the future’s horizon by a contemporary society committed to greater consumption and the global extension of the commodity relation. But, before the future—by which I am referring to anticipation—was vacated from the present, it was necessary to complete the itinerary of narrative expectation traveled by the cold war. Despite either a cultural dissatisfaction with assurance of endless progress in the future or a valorization of an already fulfilled present in Euro‐America, the cold war hurdled both by furnishing contending scripts avowing progressive fulfillment in a struggle to win the hearts and minds of the nonaligned. Different narratives pledged to make the future better than the present. As we look back upon that period stretching from war’s end to the fall of the Berlin Wall, traversing a momentous process of decolonizing—the formation of new postcolonial nation‐states in Asia and Africa, regional wars outside of Euro‐America aiming to sustain the “unity” of the West, unscheduled but periodic geno~<br>

Abstract: An alternative end to my account of the fate of re‐vision and its place in feminism today presented itself when, recently, a student came to me to discuss a possible subject for her bachelor’s thesis. She wanted to write something that would contribute to the current debate: a feminist topic, she said, but not, as she put it, “women on the barricades.” One idea she had was to write about Anita Diamant’s
         The Red Tent(1997). This novel tells the story of the biblical Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. My student had picked up the book while on holiday in Spain and had been deeply moved by it. It had transformed her views on the Bible and made her rethink the relation of women to the biblical narratives.<br>

Abstract: Peirce claimed that truth is “the opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate” [
         69, vol. 8, p. 12]. William James, however, would insist that such veridical opinion is governed by emotional, as well as intellectual, factors. One of the most important of these factors is workability. The simple formula “truth is what works” is an oversimplification of James’s view, but the idea of workability is ultimately important [70, pp. 81–94]. Veridical opinions, according to James, deal in part with humanity’s very survival as a species. Truth and falsehood apply to our ideas about the world. True ideas or propositions about the world and human nature are those that work to satisfy both the intellect and the emotions and ultimately achieve various kinds of success. This success for James can be sharper predictability in practical matters, a more encompassing view of reality that eliminates fear and superstition, and workable invention that sustains and helps human existence [70, p. 95–113].<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

How bad could Arthur feel for her over that? It's almost comic: that after all those years of being cheated out of it, the little victim comes into the old bat's money after all. Forget the will, then. What else is being plotted by Boz against my story? Why can't he know about me, my Arthur, about his mother who loved him, or at least the idea of him, loved him to melancholy and to madness? Why must he go to the altar still believing that the Clennam woman was his closest blood kin, thinking still that what was forbidden to him in her heart was actually a mother's love?

Abstract: In the present article I have undertaken the examination of individual volition in Augustine, the church father who introduced the idea of “free will” (liberum arbitrium) in religious discourse. Augustine’s portentous contribution to the discussion of volition as a token of identity and a reflection of self‐awareness consists of the identification of desire with love. To Augustine, our soul (
         animus) is not a constant and immutable attribute, but the expression of a perfectible self, which wills its own optimal instantiation when it desires first and foremost to love. After discussing Augustine, I proceeded to examine the different way whereby Marcel, the protagonist ofÀ la recherche du temps perdu, curbs his own conscious volition, which he considers an incurable source of personal egoism, in order for his better self to surrender to the love buried in his unconscious memory.<br>

Issue: 592372<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Augustine’s apology for Christianity and the idea of just war suggests a point that he and his interlocutors presumed as obvious, namely, that there is an ethics of memory—a duty to remember justly for the sake of history, self‐understanding, and narrative recollection. He thus invites us to consider the obligations and virtues of what Ricoeur calls a “just memory.”
         82Augustine’s ethics is, as I noted above, “agent‐referring”: it attends to the moral effects of an action on the character of the person carrying out that action. He developed his agent‐referring concerns, moreover, not by looking at the morality of individuals as isolated monads but as situated and affected by cultural forces that help shape character over time. The temporal quality of character and culture led him naturally to consider the virtues that surround memory, both individual and collective.83Given the intimate connection between memory and identity, there is an obvious obligation to remember for Augustine, a responsibility to remember truthfully. He thus worried about whether what people remember about themselves is prone to self‐aggrandizement and, with that, self‐deception. For these reasons, we can say that an Augustinian ethics of war is, among other things, an ethics of memory. That Rome’s morality “proceeded to bloody strife of all parties and then to the social and civil wars” is not his own personal judgment; it is, in his words, “the witness of history.”84<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Hall sees that this argument as it develops across Ricoeur’s writings raises questions about the role of reciprocity in the Ricoeur texts he considers. He acknowledges that Ricoeur’s recognition that not all human relations are face‐to‐face leads him beyond a narrow call for solicitude and friendship at this level to a concern for the level of institutions as well. It is at this level of institutions that the question of justice really arises, and with it new questions regarding responsibility and possible reciprocity, particularly regarding our ability to respond to others who we may never meet face‐to‐face. As Hall says, “love often demands a dimension of self‐sacrifice, most notably in the form of renouncing a strict reciprocity” (150). His case could have been stronger here if he had incorporated Ricoeur’s discussions of the work of John Rawls and the antisacrificial notion of justice he saw there. Beyond this, Hall’s focal idea of a relation between love and justice marked by what he calls a poetic tension should also have included some discussion of what Ricoeur says in
   The Course of Recognition(Institute for Human Sciences Vienna Lecture Series, trans. David Pellauer [Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2005]; originally published asParcours de la reconnaissance[Paris: Éditions Stock, 2004]) about the limits of existing philosophies of recognition, which he saw as not getting any further than a notion of reciprocal recognition in just the sense Hall criticizes. Ricoeur’s own answer was to begin there to lay out the idea of mutual recognition beyond mere reciprocity, a higher form of recognition that stands closer, as Hall anticipates, to something like the reception of a gift that expects nothing in return but which may lead to a second gift given to others. Readers who wish to build on Hall’s argument will want also to look at this last major book from Ricoeur.<br>

Abstract: Cohen‐Séat arrived on the postwar scene with an ambitious idea, expressed in a remarkably self‐confident book,
         Essais sur les principes d'une philosophie du cinéma.15Taking cinema to be civilization's ideal mix of qualitative experience (a sum of the arts) and quantitative impact (a global and mass phenomenon of unprecedented proportions), he called for a superdiscipline to study it, combining aesthetics with sociology. He went in search of scholars who could climb aboard a program he seems to have laid out during the occupation. In a legendary maneuver, and with no academic degree himself, he managed to successfully lobby the Sorbonne to serve as an umbrella for his fledgling research group and the journal they had inaugurated in 1948,La Revue internationale de filmologie. From the moment of its official license, late in 1950, until the very end of the decade, the institute benefited from significant support, visibly affecting the stratosphere of French education in the process. The ancient amphitheater of the Collège de France was, for example, equipped for projection. Laboratories were established for psychoperceptual and cognitive experiments. In addition to research, regular courses and lectures were offered, and a couple of full‐blown conferences took place.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This volume is something of a companion to Ricoeur’s earlier collection,
      The Just(Chicago, 2000), but positions the question differently. Ricoeur characterizes the aim of the earlier volume as a focused treatment of the relationship between justice as a moral ideal and justice as a system of institutions. “In the present volume, the adjective ‘just’ is traced back to its terminological and conceptual source, as we find it in Plato’s Socratic dialogues” (1). The volume is divided into three parts, titled respectively, “Studies,” “Readings,” and “Exercises.” This tripartite structure is one that appears constantly in Ricoeur's work. The essays in the first section isolate the idea of justice. In this initial section, Ricoeur brings thought to bear on the principal phenomenological structures through which the problematic of justice manifests itself: the necessary distance introduced into the question of justice by the imposition of a rule of justice, the relation of passivity and autonomy in the articulation of the imperative of justice, the paradoxical nature of authority, and the aporia that opens between the reflection of justice as an abstract, transhistorical ideal and justice as a historically conditioned set of institutional practices. The essays in the second section place the idea in the context of thought about justice. The principal figures who come into the discussion here are Kant, Weber, and Charles Taylor. The essays in the third section deal with the ideal of justice in the realm of practical, or regional, ethics; Ricoeur’s primary interests here are legal and medical ethics and their similarities, differences, and relations. In each of these proceeding sections, issues raised in the first section are taken up and dealt with at a progressively less abstract level. There is then a discernible trajectory that holds these essays together, one that might be characterized, without too much oversimplification, as a movement from abstract structuring of~<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: For Coleridge, I have argued, answering God’s claim is always a struggle. Prayer is the phenomenological concentration on being‐for‐God, “a conscious will‐effected sense of his presence” (N6155), as it is put in 1829. However, as we saw in the second section of this article (“
         Prayer and the Improper: Kant, Coleridge, and Kierkegaard”), such presence is, strictly speaking, unthinkable for the fallen “I.” As such, the thought of being‐for‐God is always cut against the grain of one’s being, will, and understanding. To respond, therefore, is to struggle with oneself, a struggle implicating one’s speech: prayer is also cut across the grain of language. As David Haney notes, there is a sense in which wordless prayer alone could be pure surrender.68Derrida is correct insofar as all the codes and words of prayer bear traces of predication, which, for Coleridge, are fatally intertwined with the understanding of an “I” separate from God. As Luther suggests, prayer “is a constant violent action of the spirit as it is lifted up to God. … We must all practice violence.”69Calling—replying—to God becomes a kind of violence practiced against oneself and one’s language, as is apparent in Coleridge’s description of God as an “Idea [that] worked in you, like the Memory of a Name which we cannot recollect and yet feel that we have, and which reveals its existence in the mind only by a restless anticipation and proves its prior actuality by the almost explosive instantaneity with which it is welcomed & recognized on its re‐emersion” (N4816).<br>

While Fénelon's censure in 1699 appeared to neutralize the threat posed by mysticism, Christian apologists turned from this victory to confront attacks on human agency stemming from Spinozist and materialist circles. A key battle in this polemic was fought over the status of free will as a property of the thinking subject, whether human or divine. Spinoza aimed to demonstrate that God acts
         asnature, notonnature, and out of sheer necessity. Created beings operated under a similar compulsion. The distinction between subject and object, famously associated with Descartes, was thereby dissolved. To cite theEthics(1677): “When we say that the human mind perceives this or that thing, we say nothing else than that God possesses this or that idea.”46In other words, the subject's thoughts are not its own, unique to itself, but are the manifestation of God thinking in the world and through the mind. It followed from this premise that “there is no absolute or free will,” a conclusion that undermined the possibility of transcendence for any being.47Spinoza therefore understood the highest form of wisdom, which he called the “intellectual love of God,” to be the recognition of the determined character of our existence. We are, he asserted, “part of the whole of nature, whose order we follow.”48In consequence, true liberty “is to be and to remain chained by the bonds of [God's] love.”49And this love, Spinoza claimed, was not directed toward the individual human person. It was, on the contrary, “part of the infinite love with which God loves Himself.”50For Spinoza, then, intellectual love is radically self-referential—not to the human subject, but to divine substance. The beatified self exists merely as an effect of God/Nature's immanent presence and totalizing force. At the same time, Spinoza extended dispossession beyond what Fénelon's Christian beliefs would permit~<br>

Abstract: Von Rad,
               Holy War, 49. Lest we presume such verbiage represents a bygone age, we should consider the writings of Michael Bray or Meir Kahane. As Michael Bray puts it, “This Jesus—the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8)—is the `Man of War' of the Scriptures. He is the God of Israel who wrought calamity upon Israel as well as her enemies. He is not squeamish about destruction and war. The One who uses force and consecrates others to do the same does not have a problem with it” (“A Time for Revolution?” inA Time to Kill[Portland, OR: Advocates for Life Publications, 1994], chap. 9). As he indicated in an interview with Mark Juergensmeyer, Bray advocates not just vengeance for the unborn, but decisive acts of extravagant terrorism to awaken sensibility to a world gone awry (Mark Juergensmeyer,Terror in the Mind of God[Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000], 20–30). In the same vein is the rhetoric of the late Meir Kahane, founder of the Jewish Defense League and the Kach Party of Israel and notorious for his sentiments about annexing lands adjacent to Israel (The Jewish Idea, 3rd ed. [Jerusalem: Institute for the Publications of Rabbi Meir Kahane, 1996], 318):
                        
                  We see that G‐d has declared war on the wicked and described Himself as Master of war, and that we must emulate Him in war the way we emulate His mercy and kindness, etc. Let death take those pompous individuals who rebel against G‐d and against His attributes and principles, who err and mislead others as if they were more righteous than their Creator, pious fools who hypocritically reject the war against evil and evildoers, bleating about peace when we need war, falsifying and distorting G‐d’s Torah and the laws of compulsory war against the wicked. Of them it says (
                     Isaiah48:22), “The L‐rd says to the wicked, ‘There is no peace.'”<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: This seemingly reflexive construction of possibility as a gift of itself to itself shows the blind alley facing Agamben and the need to undo this knot or to find ways of engaging it. One of the particular difficulties the problem of sovereignty engenders is that since sovereign power always retains possibility to itself, it evacuates the air of possibility from all corners of space. Lacking any of the resources of the possible, critics cannot propose alternatives to the sovereign. For instance, the idea of natural right and its inalienable character itself can buckle under the state of the exception. Right, which would seem indelible, is an actuality that grounds the political and could never be evacuated. But for Schmitt and Agamben, sovereignty can swipe to one side right with its ability to engage the possible beyond every actuality. Immanent criticism depends upon the discovery of possibility, and when critics lack this ability to think otherwise than the actual, to imagine an alternative to what is, their powers wither. Restoring the critical and the political requires a reconsideration of possibility, sovereignty, and the relationship of critique to gift. To that end we now turn at last to Tillich’s work.<br>

Abstract: Writing, a word Blanchot uses to replaceliteratureinThe Infinite Conversation,is finally for Blanchot the only way to remain true to the idea of Judaism. It is also the only way, Blanchot will argue, to remain true to the impulse of estrangement that he locates at the heart of Lévinas's philosophy. For Blanchot, insofar as the relation to the other is one of infinite distance between myself and the Other, inaugurating “a relation of impossibility and strangeness,” the language that invokes this relation must be one unsupported by presence; that is, it must be writing (EI, p. 101;IC, p. 71). Blanchot suggests further that as a mode of communication philosophy itself fails to be faithful to the relation with the Other because it requires a language that prioritizes clarity. “How can one say inequality by means of what tends to equalize?” Blanchot asks. The only speech that “would speak without leveling . . . without tending toward the identity implied by satisfaction and full understanding” is a speech that can speak of difference without grasping it or capturing it, for even when it represents its relation toward a referent it is characterized by a turn (EI, p. 90;IC, p. 63).<br>

Abstract: Early in
         Adaptation, Laroche (Chris Cooper) takes Susan to an orchid show (figs. 2–3). Laroche bends down to admire anangraecum sesquipedale, the orchid with a nectary so long that Darwin postulated the existence in the vicinity of a moth with a twelve-inch proboscis (the daring surmise, which no one believed at the time, ultimately proved correct). And this is what he says:
               
            L
               aroche:
                  
            Angraecum sesquipedale. [A] beauty! God! Darwin wrote about this one. Charles Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?

            L
               aroche:See that nectary all the way down there? Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose twelve inches long to pollinate it. And everyone thought he was a loon. Then sure enough, they found this moth with a twelve-inch proboscis. Proboscis means “nose,” by the way.

               “In this sense, they show us how to live”: the moral of the story is to be yourself, to find the one thing that you are designed to do, to pursue your passion, safe in the (almost Adam Smithian) knowledge that it will make the world a better place. This sounds like a beautiful idea, made even more beautiful by being connected to the deepest secrets of the physical world—it is as though romantic love were a law of nature, on a par with gravity and the conservation of energy—and by the luscious images of bees and ophrys orchids, often in extreme close-up and shallow focus, set to soft, rising strings. Laroche is drawing on his extensive knowledge of the anthic realm to tell us something vitally important about the human condition, indeed something existentially important, in that it can and should serve as a guide to our behavior. And so we have the glimmerings of a f~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 662056<br>

Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: First, it is not clear that Larmore’s evidence for mimetism (chap. 2) shows anything more than Charles Taylor or Wittgenstein have argued concerning meaning in general: our efforts to shape a practical identity must employ a shared language (32). That deliberation by reflection “consists in comparing ourselves to someone else” only seems evident if it amounts simply to Mead’s or Habermas’s point that reasons are dialogical or intersubjective (41), which Larmore repeatedly affirms (34). The thesis becomes dubious if instead it means that all persons are primarily motivated by tuitive motives such as envy, desire for status, or comparative advantage or that our achieving reputation in the eyes of others is fundamental to us, as Larmore’s examples often suggest (31, 46). Second, following “models” need not amount to “heteronomy” (35) since all plausible conceptions of personal autonomy admit sources of agentive capacities that influence a child in her upbringing without her choosing them; these are the educative processes that enable self-determination to start. Third, the theory of mimetism that Larmore reconstructs from René Girard seems to make any radical innovation in the history of ideas impossible. How then could the Troubadours have introduced the concept of romantic love (35)? How could cultures grow or develop if nothing is not copied from the past? Fourth, rejecting a latent self that subsists “deep inside us … unsullied by all that we have borrowed from others” (37) implies that unreflective emoting and action (or ‘flow’) is not more likely to constitute an experience of “being wholly ourselves” (55). Yet Larmore retains a version of Stendhal’s idea that completely unreflective experience is more “natural” (27) and provides one kind of authenticity since it leaves out the perspective of others that reflection always brings (64). This negative definition does not allow us to distinguish authentic spontaneity from merely careless or thoughtless ways of being ~<br>

Author(s): Regan Ethna<br>
Abstract: Not content to engage the discourses of theology and human rights by way of definition and description, Regan constructively engages both discourses, building on the work of Karl Rahner, Johann Baptist Metz, and Paul Ricoeur. The heart of the text is this constructive mode. Regan develops a theological anthropology that sees human flourishing, the aim of human being, in a “generosity of existence” (15), which is grounded in and flows from a capacity for God (76). Generosity of existence is the idea that life consists in both giving and receiving toward greater flourishing of oneself, others, and a community of being (112). The notion of generosity of existence includes a capacity for self-determination and is therefore protected by a human rights discourse that seeks to defend a zone of individual human autonomy. But this theological anthropology is not exhausted by individual autonomy. Rather, it links an individual capacity for self-determination to a responsibility for “making oneself” in response both to God and to the embeddedness of human life (82). In this sense, human rights ought to be taken seriously by any theologian who believes human beings ought to orient their lives to God, because violations of human rights severely impair this capacity and impede the possibility of responding to a divine call. She attributes the revelation of a mystical dimension to human rights activism to the insights of liberation theology, which highlights a divine element embedded in the struggle for human rights. But Regan also sees liberation theology as contributing several insights to secular liberal human rights discourse, including an awareness and acknowledgment of the systematic and structural constraints that limit the capacities of the poor of the world to flourish, and highlighting the importance of basic sociocultural rights.<br>

Abstract: Dirt then, is never a unique, isolated event. Where there is dirt, there is system. Dirt is the by-product of a systematic ordering and classification of matter, in so far as ordering involves rejecting inappropriate elements. This idea of dirt takes us straight into the field of symbolism and promises a link-up with more obviously symbolic systems of purity.

Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Author(s): Peperzak Adriaan T.<br>
Abstract: Peperzak in this book also offers continental thinkers an appealing alternative to the theological turn of phenomenology as practiced by Jean-Luc Marion and others. While Peperzak takes seriously the idea that “God cannot be investigated or explained … because God is not given as a describable phenomenon,” this realization does not turn his phenomenology away from the investigation of rational thinking because for Peperzak reason itself has to be rethought in terms of the intersubjective encounters between nonthematizable—human and divine—sayers (121). Consequently, much more than some of the thinkers of the theological turn, Peperzak’s work maintains a broadly humanist sensibility and a conviction that theological thinking and philosophy can be integrated quite well, provided the latter does not close itself off in autarky. In his humanism, Peperzak echoes the best elements in the philosophical style both of his teacher Paul Ricoeur and the philosophical tradition of his own Catholic faith, although he implicitly critiques the former for insisting too vehemently on the autonomy of philosophy (128) and calls out the latter for separating “natural reason” from faith (182–86). For his own part, Peperzak hopes to maintain an open space between faith and reason: “I do not see any valid argument against the integration of philosophical insights into a faith-inspired theology … neither would I protest if an integrated reflection of the Christian community about its faith would call itself
   philosophia” (160). For the many who share similar sentiments today,Thinking about Thinkingwill make a valuable guide to the conversation of philosophy.<br>

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: In principle, analogy is defined as a play of proportions whereby a calculated substitution can be carried out between parts on the basis of a similarity, like the one carried out by Plato in using the Sun for the Idea of the Good. Strikingly, however, Aristotle also recognizes that metaphor can operate as an analogy of proportions where one of the terms is lacking, in which case the metaphorical will have an inaugural output, being capable of projecting a representation of something hitherto unrepresented-as-such, like the sphere of ideality itself in Plato, which culminates in the Idea of the Good.<br>

Abstract: As an example, Jordy framed his doubts about the validity of conserving and rebuilding the palace in terms of inadequate design process. He wrote in his
               American Buildings, 284, that it was "a mere festival set, with many of the crudities of temporary structures that are speedily designed, rapidly executed, and intended more for an overall effect in keeping with the occasion than for intense and prolonged scrutiny." Interestingly, while enthusiastically supporting the idea of rebuilding the palace, Cardwell made a similar assumption. His defense of the project reads as a statement that a building designed "for an instant in time," and intended for large crowds of visitors whose eyes were "not prejudiced by Vignola or d'Espouy" cannot be judged by the same criteria as a piece of permanent architecture. See Cardwell,Bernard Maybeck, 151.<br>

Abstract: The second chapter, “Materiality,” is predicated on the idea that because tomb artifacts were specifically designed for the dead, they possess specific visual properties—with respect to their material, size, and decoration—directly related to their symbolic functions. Wu observes, for example, that lacquerwares from the Eastern Zhou (770–221 BCE) and Han periods were painted red and black, the colors of coffins; that vessels buried with the dead were often deliberately rendered unusable in some way; and that sculptural figurines were frequently miniaturized. This chapter also includes an important discussion of the many ways that contemporaries tried to “transform” their corporeal bodies in order to escape death.<br>

Author(s): HUTSON LORNA<br>
Abstract: ABSTRACT Current approaches to Renaissance drama, rejecting the older idea of mimesis as likeness to an essential “nature,” have also rejected the assumption that Shakespeare's drama is especially mimetic. This article argues that these approaches neglect the contribution of narrative coherence or plot tomimesis and shows that a judicial conception of narrative underlies the mimesis of neoclassical Renaissance drama, including Shakespeare. Mimetic readings of Shakespeare may thus be appropriately legalistic responses to an evidentially based conception of plot.<br>

Author(s): Ashley David<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes J. Habermas's theory of “universal pragmatics” and examines the extent to which Habermas's ideal speech community is predicted upon a specific type of relationship between the individual and society. The ability of the theory of universal pragmatics to overcome the form of domination institutionalized by modern societies is questioned, and the argument is made that Habermas's radical program of emancipation is vitiated (1) by Habermas's conflation of “transcendental” and “situationally engaged” enlightenment and (2) by Habermas's inability to reintegrate practical-emancipatory and technical forms of reason. Habermas's idea of “communicative competence” replicates, rather than displaces, the “modern” solution to the problem of the relationship between the individual and society.<br>

Author(s): Newman Lester F.<br>
Abstract: Bruce Wilshire's "The Moral Collapse of the University: Professionalism, Purity, and Alienation" challenges the internal constituencies of research universities to assess the moral condition of their institutions. His critique emanates from a university apocalyptic literature which has been most prolific during the three undergraduate curricular crises of this century. The proponents of this genre often create negative caricatures in their desire to right perceived injustices. Although Wilshire falls victim to the myopia of absolutism, he calls attention to ethical problems and issues. His thesis centers on restoring the intergenerational task of teaching to undergraduate studies within a professoriate wedded to a research production ethos. His moral argument centers on the redefinition of education against the inroads of professionalism, specialism, and careerism. His quintessential plea is to restore the moral integrity of the mentor-learner relationship. Only with such a restoration may the university revive from its moral collapse. While the author finds both Wilshire's metaethical discussion and descriptive ethical demonstrations weak, he supports the idea of a new professional ethic for the professoriate.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249760<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Young Aaron<br>
Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Article Title: 'Getting out and Getting Away': Women's Narratives of Class Mobility<br>
Publisher: Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i260667<br>
Date: 10 1, 1931<br>
Author(s): Woolf Steph<br>
Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which women narrate a move from a 'working-class' position to a position marked (in however fragmentary and complex a way) as 'middle class'. While such a move might be seen in terms of a straightforward escape from a disadvantaged social position, I argue here that what has to be analysed is the pain and the sense of estrangement associated with this class movement. Drawing on the class narratives of a group of seven white British women, the article uses Bourdieu's concepts of symbolic capital and habitus to explore the cultural and symbolic configurations of class. These configurations may be inscribed into the self, so that the self, itself, is class marked. Since working-class selves are frequently marked in pathological terms, this raises particular difficulties for the idea of an 'escape' from such a position. Class in this sense is embedded in people's history and so cannot be so easily 'escaped'. The usual conventions of life-narratives - in which the self remains the same entity from birth to death and later events are a culmination of earlier ones - are also disrupted in this case. But if a working-class position is marked as pathological, so too is taking on the markers of middle-class existence. to do so is not only to risk 'getting it wrong', but it is also to risk the scorn attached to 'pretentiousness'. There is a particular jeopardy here for women, since it is women who have been especially associated with desires for artefacts associated with bourgeois existence. The article argues for a focus for classed desires and class envy, not in pathological terms, but in terms of a coherent response to political and social exclusions.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303104<br>
Date: 4 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Zea Walter D.<br>
Abstract: This essay expands on the idea that gave rise to these two special issues of Poetics Today and explores the connections between place and theory, between geocultural locations and theoretical practices. It examines the genealogy of self-descriptions instead of focusing on the "Western" construction of the "extreme West" (i.e., the New World, America, etc.). It emphasizes colonial legacies in the construction of postcolonial theories and assesses postmodernity from the perspective of postcoloniality, demonstrating that geocultural locations are not necessarily bound to given theoretical practices, although it maintains that, in the social sciences and the humanities, the place one is from and the place one is in are part and parcel of what one imagines and constructs. In a transnational world, displacement and exile are creating new relationships between places and theories. Boundaries, rather than nations or regions, are the places where new theoretical energies emerge. This Afterword also attempts to construct a genealogy of colonial legacies and postcolonial theories in the Americas and, by so doing, attempts to rearticulate the succession of colonial imaginary constructions that have mapped and remapped "The Americas."<br>

Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i20109441<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Baek Jin<br>
Abstract: In his philosophy of nothingness, Kitarō Nishida illuminates the matrix of transformation of the world "from the Created to the Creating" (tsukuru mono kara tsukurareta mono e) through shintai, or the body. In this matrix, shintai enters into the stage of an action-sensation continuum and emerges as the immaculate iconic tool of nothingness to create new figures as extended self. This idea of shintai has resonance with the development of postwar art in Japan. The "Space of Transparency" put forth by Ufan Lee, the leader of Monoha, is the principal example. This essay investigates Nishida's notion of shintai and its influence on Lee's theory of art.<br>

Author(s): Lemel Yannick<br>
Abstract: Les théories de la modernisation proposées dans les années cinquante et soixante avançaient l'idée que les sociétés convergeaient vers les valeurs modernes et abandonnaient progressivement leurs valeurs traditionnelles. Cette idée de convergence est réexaminée dans cet article, dans le contexte des seules sociétés européennes, à partir de l'exploitation des enquêtes Valeurs. Une série d'échelles d'attitudes sont construites, puis analysées par des techniques multivariées. Deux résultats principaux se dégagent de cette étude. Tout d'abord, il apparaît que, quelle que soit la date ou les pays examinés, les valeurs des Européens se structurent toujours autour d'un axe de traditionalisme. Un tel résultat est évidemment en contradiction avec les thèses, fortement critiquées par ailleurs, de convergence vers la modernité. Ce résultat est aussi l'occasion de réfléchir sur le pendant du traditionalisme -- faut-il l'appeler "modernité"? -- et sur les liens entre les attitudes économiques et les attitudes morales. En second lieu, la religiosité est étroitement liée à cette structuration des valeurs, mais elle oppose principalement les Européens affiliés à une religion quelle qu'elle soit aux sans-religion, plutôt que -- comme on l'imagine souvent -- les catholiques aux protestants. Au total, la tension entre tradition et modernité reste au cœur du système de valeurs des sociétés européennes. /// The modernization theories developed in the 1950s and 60s put forward the idea that societies were converging toward modern values and gradually abandoning their traditional values. Using data from the Values surveys, the article reexamines the convergence idea in the context of European societies. A set of attitude scales was constructed, then analyzed using multivariate techniques. Analysis yielded two main results. First, regardless of date or country examined, Europeans' values seem still to be structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously runs counter to converge~<br>

Article Title: Imagining the International Community: The Constitutive Dimension of Universal Jurisdiction<br>
Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Article Title: Responsible Belief and Our Social Institutions<br>
Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i20533165<br>

Author(s): van Woudenberg René<br>
Abstract: The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange, puzzling, beyond belief, false, meaningless or at any rate defective. The first section develops the alleged problem. The burden of this paper, however, is not to discuss the merits of this idea but rather to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective indeed. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea indeed underlies large and important stretches of our social and institutional life. Section 2 substantiates that claim by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what I call "deontological epistemic expressions", i.e. expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined; examples are "obligation to believe", "not permitted to forget", "right to know". The ubiquitous use of these expressions, I argue, is linguistic evidence for the claim that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. Linguistic evidence, however, can be frail and misleading. From the fact that we say that the shade is moving we cannot conclude that shades really exist; likewise it may not be permitted to conclude from the ubiquitous use of deontological epistemic expressions that there really are doxastic obligations (and hence doxastic responsibilities). The third section, therefore, moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, viz. education and law as we find them in modern Western societies, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. Educational and legal systems of course vary greatly throughout the Western world. Such differences as exist, however, are irrelevant for the claim I will be making in t~<br>

Abstract: Concordo sulla modernizzazione acritica di Euripide corne poeta scettico e sulla serie-
tà sostanziale della religiosità delle tragedie; mi sembra invece azzardata l'idea che queste
tragedie avessero la funzione di "rassicurare" il pubblico sull'esistenza di un "ordine e di
un piano" divino per quanto imperscrutabili. Afferma S.I. "The most terrifying thing is a
world that has no meaning, no order, and no plan. Euripidean tragedies show that the world
does have order and meaning, and works on a plan of Zeus" (p. 410). È assai probabile che
gli ultimi venti anni del quinto secolo abbiano rappresentato un periodo di instabilità di
valori e di crisi, tuttavia l'idea di un mondo "senza significato, ordine e finalità" mi sembra
molto moderna, se non post-moderna, e assai difficilmente significante nell'Atene di fine
quinto secolo. Più pertinente è invece l'accento sull'importanza di praticare il culto per
mantenere il rapporto di benevolenza tra uomini e dèi (ibidem).<br>

di forti componenti di pessimismo storico nelle opere di molti autori settecenteschi (cfr.

Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Abstract: The article identifies a paradox in the concept of person and in its use. Modernity, and the liberation from the logic of status, should have brought about the ultimate consolidation of the idea of personal value. On the contrary it caused such a drastic functional differentiation within society that the individual has come to be defined by his/her function (citizen, economic actor, etc.) rather than as the single bearer of different roles. The concept of person has thus become an expression to identify only the communicative aspect of social life. That is the reason why in our complex society the concept of person cannot find a proper location and comes to the fore only when the other codes fail.<br>

Abstract: La strategia presidenziale di Néstor Kirchner ha investito su un'operazione di ridefini-
zione dei valori politici nel tentativo di costruire un consenso in seguito alla crisi della rap-
presentanza politica seguita al biennio 2001-2002. Nel discorso di Kirchner, l'identifica-
zione con il concetto di democrazia, già introdotta vent'anni prima da Raúl Alfonsin, è ac-
compagnata da un nuovo tratto, definito da alcuni intellettuali un «nazionalismo sano», di-
stinto dal nazionalismo inclusivo e intollerante dei militari e dei regimi di estrema destra.
In questo caso si tratterebbe della promozione dell'idea della ricostruzione dell'Argentina
per mano degli argentini. Da qui l'insistenza nel discorso del presidente sul necessario «re-
cupero» dell'Argentina, dell'identità, della memoria, della giustizia, dei sogni, della coabi-
tazione, delle istituzioni, dello Stato, del rispetto, della stima di sé. Su questo punto, si ve-

Article Title: Phenomenology of Bodily Integrity in Disfiguring Breast Cancer<br>
Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23254812<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: Le patrimoine est devenu un terme particulièrement utilisé dans le vocabulaire politique et culturel tout autant qu'il est devenu très usité dans le monde académique. De l'avis de bien des auteurs, tout serait devenu patrimoine. Certains s'inquiètent de cette inflation patrimoniale, considérée comme un symptôme d'un nouveau rapport au temps présent. Cette contribution tente de montrer, en partant du champ d'investigation travaillé par les géographes, que toutes ces approches peuvent en réalité être reconsidérées de manière plus globale. Ce texte pose l'hypothèse qu'elles s'inscrivent dans une chronogenèse, c'est-à-dire une mise en récit des éléments épars grâce à la création d'un discours caractérisé par une accumulation de signes et d'éléments permettant de penser et de se représenter linéairement l'image-temps. En s'inspirant notamment du travail engagé par P. Ricœur sur la notion de temporalité, ce texte défend l'idée que les éléments patrimonialisés participent d'une logique de mise en intrigue, et plus largement d'une mise en cohérence d'éléments hétérogènes, servant à articuler des récits. Ceux-ci autorisent à repenser une certaine unité de l'histoire de l'humanité dans son rapport au monde physique. Heritage has become a very common term in political and cultural discourse, as well as a widely used term in the academic world. Numerous authors have pointed out that everything has become heritage, and expressed concern that such terminological inflation can be seen as a symptom of a new relationship to the present. Based on investigations conducted primarily by French geographers, this paper explores this academic research as revealing a process of "Chronogenesis" (Chronogenèse) : in this, scattered elements are embedded into a narrative, creating a discourse characterized by an accumulation of signs and elements that allows a linear conception and representation of the image and time. Inspired by the work of P. Ricœur on the notion of temporality, this article~<br>

Abstract: Between the sixties and the eighties metaphysics has been in a state of crisis; logic and the human sciences seemed to have taken over. The last few years have, however, witnessed a return of metaphysics. Having first called to mind some of the features of the aforetold crisis and evoked some recent authors, the article proceeds to show how reflexive metaphysics is capable of integrating the demands of the physical sciences and mathematics, and through them of building up the idea of being. A constitutive requirement of this idea is that epistemology and its categories of objectivity be surpassed through the affirmation of the other, whose existence and essence are the fundamental categories of transcendence. The ethical experience is surpassed in its turn, in such a way that through transcendence a fulness may manifest itself; the doctrine of analogy and the transcendentals opens the understanding of that fulness. Reflexive experience enlivens the discourse and ensures its exactness.<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Abstract: Dès ses premiers écrits, Lonergan a été attentif à la dimension d'amitié qui caractérise les ordres trinitaire et créé. L'homme est par essence ouvert au delà de lui-même; ne pouvant pas coïncider à soi, il est appelé à quelque conversion. La pensée moderne, qui par contre l'a prétendu capable de présence à soi; soutint l'individualisme où le rapport à l'autre devenait instrumental. La réaction postmoderne, qui accentue l'idée d''autre', réveille la conscience à ses traits plus humains, en favorisant en même temps un retour à la tradition philosophique et théologique sur l'amitié, où d'ailleurs son idée d''autre' se voit elle-même enrichie. La réflexion thomiste sur la charité comme amitié divine est ici décisive. Lonergan la reprend en explicitant l'essence du corps mystique. L'attention à l'expérience concrète invite enfin à conduire la réflexion jusqu'au plan de l'éducation, d'où on ne peut pas abstraire l'exigence du don de soi, à l'exemple du Christ qu'y s'est abaissé jusqu'à nous. From his earliest writings Lonergan was attentive to the friendship dimension that marks the trinitarian and created orders. Humanity remains essentially open to what is beyond itself: unable to coincide with itself, it is called to some conversion. Modern thought by contrast has focussed on self-presence, thus giving rise to individualism where relationship to others becomes instrumental. The reaction of the post-modern is to underline the idea of the 'other', awaking conscience to more human traits, thus promoting a retrieval of a philosophical and theological tradition on friendship. In this way the idea of the 'other' finds itself enriched and Thomist reflection on charity as divine friendship becomes crucial. Lonergan adapts this tradition to explain the essence of the mystical body. Attention to concrete experience pushes us to extend our reflection to the level of education, where one cannot ignore the requirement for self-giving, on the example of Christ who lowered himself t~<br>

Abstract: Johann Georg Hamann saw the written word of God as the ultimate consequence of his incarnation. The biblical texts as well also carry the death of Christ in their essence as a figure of incarnation. Roland Barthes called the process of putting these texts into writing, by which the text gains autonomy in relation to the author, the "death of the author". In terms of the theology of the Holy Scriptures, this idea can be connected to the way people have been talking about the death of God in the modern age. One must however distinguish between the death of the author and the death of the text. This occurs when exegesis does not want to accept the death of the author. When however during reading there is a new understanding of biblical texts, this means to a certain extent their resurrection.<br>

Abstract: L'approche par les capabilités proposée par A. Sen a été considérée comme une révolution dans l'analyse du développement et, en particulier, de la pauvreté. Si elle a exercé une influence sur les indicateurs du développement, elle pose néanmoins la question de la conception sous-jacente du sujet. Cet article montre que la conception de la personne utilisée par Sen est insuffisante et qu'il pratique un individualisme très standard. Cette approche est d'autant plus problématique qu'elle n'est pas simplement compréhensive, mais aussi normative. En ne tenant pas compte de la fragilité de la personne, son analyse aboutit finalement à une faiblesse morale. The capability approach proposed by A. Sen constitutes a real change in the poverty analysis. It influenced considerably development indicators. However, the question who really is the subject behind this approach is at stake. In this paper we defend the idea that the conception of the person used by Sen is relatively standard. It is then problematic because his approach is not only comprehensive but also normative. His analyse finally conducts to a moral weakness. El enfoque de las capabilidades propuesto por A. Sen fue considerado como una revolución en el análisis del desarrollo y, en particular, en el de la pobreza. Si bien ejerció una influencia sobre los indicadores de desarrollo, plantea la cuestión de la concepción subyacente del sujeto. Este artículo muestra que la concepción de la persona utilizada por Sen es insuficiente y que practica un individualismo muy estándar. Este enfoque es aún más problemático dado que no es simplemente comprensivo sino también normativo. Al no considerar la fragilidad de la persona, su análisis desemboca finalmente en una debilidad moral.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur connects the philosophical concept of 'recognition' to the ethnological analysis of ceremonial gift exchange by focusing on the term 'gratitude'. Particularly by means of a content analysis of the French word 'reconnaissance' (recognition) Ricoeur demonstrates that the term 'reconnaissance' is closely linked with the notion of gratitude. Thus Ricoeur broadens the philosophical concept of 'recognition', that is mainly defined in reference to the influential idea of an endless 'struggle for recognition' (Kampf um Anerkennung) as Friedrich Hegel puts it. Ricoeur outlines the interesting idea that gratitude binds donor and recipient together and that the ceremonial gift exchange symbolises the mutual recognition of donor and recipient. Hence the experience of the gift should be understood as the experience of being recognised. I wish to pursue these considerations by arguing that the gift exchange can only then be considered as establishing a mutual recognition if the gift itself is also recognised and acknowledged as such. As Marcel Mauss demonstrated this is the case in traditional societies. As soon, however, as the gift loses this special capacity to express recognition, the mutual recognition of donor and recipient will be lost.<br>

Abstract: History is not neutral. It is rendered ideological by the very act of being conveyed in a narrative form, for language is both the purveyor of meaning and the principle locus of ideology. This paper explores the idea of history as discourse, and its deployment in the cultural-symbolic construction of the Singapore nation. To this end, I have chosen to analyse a key moment for Singapore history, the years 1963-65, when Singapore was first merged with the nation of Malaysia, and then separated from it. The way that these events are described in official histories is used by the government of Singapore to justify its policy of multiracialism, which also serves as a legitimating device confirming the state in its political and ideological hegemony. I have examined the events through analysis of local newspapers, The Straits Times and Berita Harían, to see in what ways their reporting may have helped to mould popular understandings of what was happening.<br>

Abstract: Le lien entre pensée philosophique et pensée juive chez Hermann Cohen se confond avec son concept de raison ou de rationalité. Dès ses premiers travaux, il s'attache à éprouver la dimension universaliste de la tradition juive. Or la rationalit/e du judaïsme réside, selon lui, dans l'idée d'une morale universelle, qui se manifeste avant tout dans la pensée messianique. Ce lien apparaît le plus clairement dans les écrits qui font converger le judaïsme et la philosophie kantienne dans l'horizon de la raison. Sous l'aspect de la philosophie pratique, cette convergence rejoint le projet politique de l'assimilation du judaïsme et de la culture allemande. The link between philosophical reflexion an Jewish thought in Hermann Cohen is thoroughly determined by his concept of reason or rationality. Since his earlier works Cohen tries to show the universalistic dimension of Jewish tradition. Now the rationality of Judaism lies in its universal morality, which is inherent to the perspective of messianism. This appears clearly in those works where Cohen brings together Judaism and Kantian philosophy with regard to the idea of reason. In the field of practical philosophy such a convergency is part of the political project of assimilation between Judaism and German culture.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the object and the methodology of conceptual history, by elaborating on Reinhart Koselleck's idea of key concepts, and proposes to study them according to two different aspects of meaning: The representational aspect, which touches upon the relations between words and concepts and studies words and concepts within semantic fields, and the referential aspect, which brings in both the social history reflected in semantic changes and the contexts in which the concepts serve as factors, and which make the use of the concepts possible. The article concludes with a methodological suggestion for the use of digitized textual databases for diachronic as well as synchronic histories of concepts.<br>

Abstract: The main end of this article is to offer a critical analysis of autonomy conceived as a basic idea in modern educational philosophy. After the tragic experience and dramatic consequences of totalitarianism, is not possible to defend a kantian concept of autonomy as a unique source of moral responsibility and ethical action. After holocaust, we need to defend, on the contrary, the principle of previous value of heteronomy, conceived as the practice of otherness, in its levinasian perspective. So, the authors explore the thesis of the prior value of heteronomy on autonomy, as a source and foundation of moral responsibility in educational relationship, and to reflect the general educational implications of the jewish philosophical tradition of otherness in philosophical educational discourse.<br>

Abstract: O filme Diamante de Sangue [Blood Diamond] de Edward Zwick oferece a possibilidade de uma reflexão à volta de três aspetos da noção de testemunho no âmbito da Filosofia da Religião: 1) a ideia de que o testemunho (absoluto), enquanto matriz das culturas humanas, sustenta a atividade jornalística e a sociedade da informação possibilitando não apenas a sua desconstrução como também a (re-)atualização de uma dimensão testemunhal do jornalismo; 2) as condições de possibilidade da conversão da consciência, isto é, da rutura com o estado de má-fé (auto-engano) necessária à consciência testemunhal e religiosa; 3) a indissociabilidade da experiência testemunhal e da doação, correlativas da experiência religiosa entendida como "fundação mútua" do divino e da testemunha (constituinte), experiência religiosa da qual surge o testemunho. Acrescentaremos ainda a ideia de que a experiência testemunhal ganha sentido à luz da metafísica do tempo do projeto. The film Blood Diamond from Edward Zwick offers the possibility of a reflection concerning three aspects of the concept of testimony within the Philosophy of Religion: 1) the idea that the testimony (absolute), while source of human cultures, supports the journalistic activity and gives information to the society; not only in its deconstruction but also in (re-)updating the testimonial dimension of journalism, 2) the conditions of possibility of the consciousness conversion, meaning, the rupture with the state of bad faith (self-deception) will required to the testimonial and religious consciousness, 3) the inseparability of the testimonial experience and donation, correlates in the religious experience, understood as “mutual foundation” of the divine and the witness (constituent), religious experience from which comes the testimony. We add further the idea that the testimonial experience makes sense in light of the metaphysics of time of project.<br>

Author(s): Greve Anni<br>
Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880901<br>
Date: 3 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): PATRICK MORAG<br>
Abstract: Many contemporary liberals increasingly accept that plural societies must aspire to far more expansive and inclusive ideals of justice and citizenship than liberal doctrine would suggest. The dominant perception is that extending the set of rights is the most effective way to implement a just and stable multicultural society. In fact, this is not a very plausible description of what people seek in demanding greater respect for diversity. Nor does it offer a compelling vision of how things ought to be. First, social expectations regarding recognition are not uniquely linked to rights; they encompass intractable struggles over values, as well as ways of living and evaluating. For example, a central feature of feminist, black and multicultural politics is the attempt to change social culture into a medium through which personal integrity and self-esteem may be acquired. Second, liberalism cannot easily accommodate this type of struggle, since it takes for granted a narrowly constricted conception of politics that is based on instituting public laws that harmonize the freedom of everyone. Anyone who takes seriously the idea that recognition surpasses legal relations of respect will then surely wish to consider whether liberalism must not be corrected and extended to reveal the political significance of the social conditions that enable individuals to experience themselves as both autonomous and individuated.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880984<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: Creating one's identity is an on-going process, which is greatly dependent on language. Having this idea as a starting point in the study of religiosity, sharing self-reported experiences can be seen as an integral part in constructing one's religious identity and personal conviction. In this article, I would like to present the idea of bringing together narrative research and the psychological approach to the study of religious experience with the help of personal experience stories about God's guidance told by Christian believers who are members of a charismatic revival movement.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917924<br>
Date: 9 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Antonaccio Maria<br>
Abstract: This article argues that Iris Murdoch makes a distinctive contribution to the agenda of theological humanism by formulating a revised theology of culture. Specifically, the article claims that Murdoch provides a compelling apologia for religious life in a secular world in two ways: by defending the significance of individual consciousness, and by retrieving an idea of the religious depth of morality. In doing so, Murdoch's work challenges antihumanist currents in modern and postmodern thought, offers an alternative to confessional forms of religious reflection, and revises previous theologies of culture (such as Tillich's) by giving priority to the ethical dimension of human life.<br>

Abstract: Examining the relevance of communitarian thought for feminist theory, this essay considers the idea of narrative identity in certain types of communitarianism and feminism. It claims that the particular way in which the idea of narrative identity is elaborated raises difficulties for a feminist understanding of gender identity. The syncretic and over generalised idea of narrative identity derived from communitarian thought ode snot adequately grasp important aspects of the ways in which gender inequalities are constructed.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917928<br>
Date: 6 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Bouchard Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Tragedy depicts harm to integrity—personal, moral, bodily, even the integrity of nature—and so offers occasions for rethinking the idea of integrity. These occasions may prompt us to set aside notions of pristine wholeness, moral perfection, and solitary authenticity for a more relational integrity, informed by the paradigms of performance and kenosis. This essay first juxtaposes King Lear with a film by Kristian Levring, The King Is Alive, and then moves to Shakespeare's earlier A Midsummer Night's Dream. All three works are metatheatrical, and depict people playing-as-others in solicitude for others. Each in its way broaches the ethical and theological possibility of 'kenotic integrity'.<br>

Abstract: The article deals with different procedures of taking to court and call to account the mass of perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide of 1994 and to doing justice to the few surviving victims and to international humanitarian law. The first section outlines the fundamental differences between vengeance and forgiveness on the one hand and redistributive and restorative justice on the other. The second section sketches the preconditions and the course of the genocide itself. Section three deals with the pitfalls and accomplishments of the International Criminal Court for Rwanda, section four with those of the Rwandan criminal courts in applying criminal law to mass violence. Section five presents and analyses the modernized Rwandan gacaca courts as a possible means to overcome the (partial) inadequacies of redistributive justice and to reconcile the Rwandan society. It is argued that although the gacaca courts do not work in a truly restorative manner and sometimes even counteract the idea of restoration, they still do bear the potential of democratizing and civilizing the war-torn and violence-ridden country of Rwanda. Section six finally discusses the restrictions, implications and limitations the Rwandan government was and is facing in choosing between redistributive and restorative approaches.<br>

Abstract: Bynum, p. 133: "Moreover, in medieval physiological theories — however confused they may
be on the subject — the female in some sense provides the matter of the foetus, the male the life or
spirit. Medieval theologians sometimes stressed that, as Eve came from the matter of Adam, so
Christ came from the matter of Mary." Si senta Lochrie, pp. 117-118: "The centrality of the first
two kinds of imitatio Christi, particularly to female spirituality, is further complicated by the
medieval medical and theological alignment of the female with flesh, and the male with the spirit.
Both Galenic and Aristotelian theories of conception consider the woman's contribution to the
fetus to be a material one, that is, the woman provides the matter of flesh to the developing human
being. This medieval conception theory carries important theological implications for the Virgin
Mary's role in the incarnation of Christ and ultimately for imitatio Christi. The Virgin's humanity is
celebrated for providing Christ with sinless flesh — the materia redeemed from the Fall — In
Hildegard of Bingen's idea of her as tunica humanitatis, the 'clothing of humanity' that Christ puts
on."<br>

Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Whereas the concept of "socialist rule of law" punctuated political discourse in the late 1990s, it is the idea of a "socialist harmonious society" that today casts a strange light, clearly more Marxist than Confucian, on Chinese legal reform. This theoretical framework turns law into a disciplinary principle dedicated to society's moral construction. If law is seen as an instrument for legitimizing power, it remains implicitly but primarily subordinate to the regime's durability. Although more and more ordinary citizens are seizing hold of normative tools being put at their disposal, the party-state, fearful of being outflanked, is seeking to snuff out the democratic ferment contained in forces it has itself unleashed.<br>

Abstract: The article calls attention to the role and function of exemplary "models", defined as evoking signs that move people to reflect their own values and orientations. It was Albert Bandura who first showed that human learning generally has the form of learning from models. Recent insights of neuroscience confirm and explain Bandura's theories: The human brain as a neuronal network estimates things according to similarities of their entire structure. Thus it can be called a "machine estimating structural connections". These insights can inspire moral theology: A concrete model can show the wide range of possibilities christian faith can open to believers. Christian tradition has always maintained this idea by understanding christian life as imitatio Christi. However, "imitatio" must be understood as the free and creative act of an autonomous subject.<br>

Abstract: The christology of the French Jesuit Joseph Moingt, L'homme qui venait de Dieu (published in 1993), is part of the younger history of narrative theology. Referring to the christology of Rahner and Balthasar, Jüngel and Pannenberg, Moingt is "reconstructing" the history of faith in the horizon of the narrative time of the Gospel. The criterion for this "reconstruction" is the history – of God and men – which follows the path of the Gospel's texts and which has been orientated from the beginning to future. Jesus Christ is "announced as the man who has to come and whom the whole world attended", the man "coming from the future and who is the future of men, because of illuminating for all men the way to the future". Joseph Moingt's "théologie du récit" récit" to the discussion about the foundation of systematic christology. The following article presents the principal idea of Moingt's christology, it is governed by the question of the Christ's preexistence. This is the central point in the discussions about the importance of narrativity in actual dogmatics.<br>

Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Abstract: Cet article vise à opérer une comparaison des traitements de la relation que le choix entretient avec le destin et la contingence tels qu'ils apparaissent dans le mythe d'Er de Platon et la philosophie pratique d'Aristote. L'hypothèse que nous défendrons est que cette comparaison permet de mettre au jour une inversion consistant dans le passage d'une conception où le choix se trouve mis au principe d'un destin et de son temps clos à l'affirmation d'un choix exclusif de toute idée de destin et constitutif, par conséquent, d'un temps ouvert. The purpose of this paper is to compare the analysis of the relationship that choice has to fate and contingency as they appear in Plato's myth of Er and in Aristotle's practical philosophy. Our hypothesis is that this comparison brings out an inversion consisting in the transition from a conception where choice is conceived as the principle of fate and of its enclosed time to the affirmation of a choice that is exclusive of any idea of fate and founds an open time.<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

Abstract: El artículo se propone como un acercamiento crítico a los modelos normativistas y acciorracionalistas de la sociología partiendo de la idea de que sobrevaloran las capacidades agenciales para entender y evaluar los mecanismos de la vida social. Frente a esos planteamientos teóricos proponemos que la contingencia y el fracaso (con la que no cuentan esas perspectivas) comparezcan como realidades constantes, inevitables e idóneas para comprender la acción social. En ese recorrido nos apoyamos en la propuesta de Ramos sobre la dimensión trágica de la acción, además de en la reformulación por parte de Arendt del concepto heideggeriano de cuidado. Finalmente, recalamos en la crítica a la función atribuida a determinados expertos en el escenario actual de la crisis económica, desde el presupuesto sobre su capacidad para predecir y corregir los rumbos sociales orientándolos hacia la consecución del éxito. This paper is proposed as a critical approach to normativism and rational-action based sociological models, starting from the idea that they overrate the capacities of agents to understand and evaluate the mechanisms of social life. In opposition to these theoretical approaches, we suggest that contingency and failure (not taken into account by these approaches) appear as constant realities, inevitable and appropriate for understanding social action. In this journey we rely on Ramos' proposal on the tragic dimension of action, in addition to the reformulation by Arendt of Heidegger's concept of care. Finally, we critique the role assigned to certain experts in the current scenario of economic crisis,from presumption of the ability to predict and correct social paths, pushing for success as a goal.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the political and mnemonic programme to be found in the last books of the British historian and thinker Tony Judt. The author of this article assumes that the final period of Judt's writing, in which he produced Ill Fares the Land, The Memory Chalet, and the posthumously published discussion with Timothy Snyder entitled Thinking the Twentieth Century, is dependent on a kind of 'art of memory'. For Judt, being terminally ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and thus condemned to immobility, this method became not so much—as in the case of its classic varieties—a technology of remembering, as a manner of recognizing and analyzing the contemporary world by turning to his own biography. The purpose was to construct a 'political testament' for the Western world in a time of crisis whose roots, according to Judt, can be found in the supremacy that 'economic' thinking has achieved over traditional political thought. In a gesture reminiscent of the Stoic 'techniques of the self' described by Michel Foucault, Judt, by exploiting his own no less complicated biography and identity, tries to throw light on the complicated history of the 20th century, containing the sources of 'our contemporary ills'. Biography and history thus meet here in a 'work of memory' whose horizon and catalyzer is the perspective of death, and whose stake is the idea of a political community experiencing, according to Judt, a period of inertia.<br>

Abstract: There is an obvious parallel between foundationalism, which ignores history in working out the conditions of knowledge, and radical relativism, which contends that by virtue of its own historical character there is no way to choose among different interpretations, all of which are "equally good." Might it not be, rather, that the recent historicist attack on the very idea of rationality is as damaging as foundationalist objections against the plurality of conceptual schemes or frameworks? Can philosophy maintain the traditional distinction between the form and content of knowledge, between rationality and historicity between doxa and episteme?<br>

Abstract: Having a voice, either at the level of the individual or the community, has been one of the atavistic ways of defining or asserting humanity. This allows for the inscription of the twin-capped hegemony of successes or victories and frustrations at both the private locus and the public sphere. The disruptions of this possibility by rifts between natives in pre-colonial South Africa were aggravated in the heat of the colonial suppression it suffered, and was compounded by the operation of apartheid rule. By reason of this misrule, voices were suppressed, with a few cacophonies of dissention breaking forth. The culmination of these disenchantments into the demise of apartheid significantly presaged the need for reconstruction and redefinition of citizenship and cohabitation, and hence the necessity for establishing a public sphere, or put alternatively, a public domain in the form of the Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. This paper, therefore, seeks to interrogate the dramatic world(s) created using the material properties of the TRC in John Kani's Nothing but the Truth and Zakes Mda's The Bells of Amersfoort. The paper argues that the domination and manipulation of this public realm by the state at the expense of the individual is not only counterproductive, but constitutes a denial of the relevance of such spheres. The paper, going by indices in the plays, therefore, concludes that every individual should not only be: given a voice, and be heard, but be allowed equal unbiased participation. Otherwise, the public sphere would not just be impotent, but the idea of nation-building and desirable citizenship would be a mere ruse. Avoir une voix, que ce soit au niveau individuel ou communautaire, a été l'un des moyens ataviques de définition et d'affirmation de l'humanité. Cela tient compte de l'inscription de l'hégémonie à double face des succés ou victoires et des frustrations tant au niveau de l'espace privé que de la sphère publique. Les pa~<br>

Abstract: The Aristotelian concept of phronesis or practical wisdom has played a prominent role in the long and deep wake of the Perestroika controversy in political science, where a diverse group of practitioners rallied in opposition to the perceived hegemony of quantitative methods in the discipline. As scholars like Bent Flyvbjerg have proposed the contours of a post-Perestroikan social science, political scientists and theorists have taken his use of the idea of practical wisdom to herald the dawning of a new social science, less beholden to notions of method. This paper examines the post-Perestroikan appropriation of Aristotle using Hans-Georg Gadamer's interpretation of phronesis as a starting point. Viewed from this vantage, contemporary uses of phronesis seem less like the foundations for a new social science, and more like a new spin on the old arguments about method that have characterized social science since the mid-1800s.<br>

Article Title: THE POETICS OF ANCIENT GREEK MEMORY AND THE HISTORICAL IMPERATIVE<br>
Publisher: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.<br>
Issue: i24542986<br>
Date: 10 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Grethlein Jonas<br>
Abstract: This book examines Greek engagements with the past as articulations of memory formulated against the contingency of chance associated with temporality. Based on a phenomenological understanding of temporality, it identifies four memorializing strategies: continuity (tradition), regularity (exemplarity), development, and acceptance of chance. This framework serves in pursuing a twofold aim: to reconstruct the literary field of memory in fifth-century BCE Greece; and to interpret Greek historiography as a memorializing mode. The key contention advanced by this approach is that acts of memory entailed an "idea of history" that was articulated not only in historiography, but also in epinician poetry, elegy, tragedy, and oratory. The book offers a rich account of poetic conventions and contexts through which each of these genres counterbalanced contingency through the use of exemplary and traditional modes of memory. This fine analysis highlights the grip of the present on the past as a significant feature of both historiographical and nonhistoriographical genres. The essay argues that this work fills a disciplinary gap by extending the reflection on memory to a new period, Greek antiquity. The retrospective positioning of this period at the outset of Western historical thought brings Grethlein's investigation to the center of debates about memory, temporality, and the meaning history. In engaging with the book's argument, the essay suggests that historiographical memory emerged in Greece not as a first-order encounter with time, but as a second-order encounter with forgetting. This confrontation marked a certain separation of historiography from other memorializing genres. Whereas poetic and rhetorical memories were posited against contingency, historiography sought to retrieve those aspects of the past that may otherwise have been irretrievably lost and forgotten. In doing so, it formulated the historiographical imperative as a negation of forgetting that problematized~<br>

Abstract: Max Weber's ideas of value pluralism and disenchantment haunt modern political thought often without explicit acknowledgement. The problem of value pluralism in the work of Isaiah Berlin and John Rawls is explored. Is there an uncritical, even if implicit, acceptance of the idea of a connection between 'the fact of pluralism' as Rawls calls it and the idea of disenchantment?<br>

Author(s): Djedi Youcef<br>
Abstract: Once in 1997, in a lecture on 'L'avenir des religions en dialogue', at the Church of St Paul in Strasbourg, Paul Ricœur argued that Islam could not really take part in debates on modernity. Maybe he simply meant that Islam as a whole had not yet been worked upon by modernity, that it did not 'think' itself in modernity yet. This statement, which is certainly not to be understood as an exclusion of Islam, is indeed interesting from a philosopher of modernity who saw in the Weberian approach of history an 'anti-Hegelian solution'. This recalls how the great German philosopher handled Islam, which he undoubtedly admired, but which he also relegated to Oriental quietism. For Hegel, Islam vacated active history along with its 'progress' towards the fulfilment of the Idea of Liberty. In other words, modernity would henceforth proceed without Islam. Indeed, Max Weber did not really think about the situation of Islam in modernity, nor as an actor in modernity. At that time, much of the Muslim world was under European domination, and the army of the Ottoman empire itself was under the control of German experts. The Muslim Caliphate had moreover no other importance other than that with regard to Germany's Mitteleuropa policy. The other European powers that were to dismember the Ottoman empire were already 'Islamic powers', as can be read in Becker on the French colonial empire. Weber certainly witnessed the storm in the teacup echoed by his fellow countryman Becker and the Dutchman Snouck Hurgronje about the Ottoman Shayẖ al-islām's call to holy war. But he did not envisage the disappearance of the Caesaropapism and its consequences for Islam as a whole and, especially, for the Islamic Church, which was his focus of interest. What interests us here is that Weber, who underlined the linkage between the configuration of modern capitalism and Christian movements stemming from the Reformation, sometimes presents Islam as the antithesis of this modernity. Yet we speak at the momen~<br>

Publisher: University of Tulsa<br>
Issue: i24598607<br>
Date: 7 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: Ernst Troeltsch distinguished between naive, apologetic and evolutionistic absoluteness.
From the original spontaneity of 'naive absoluteness' and its artificial (partly super-
naturalistic, partly rationalistic) defence as 'apologetic absoluteness' (in the Middle Ages and
in the Enlightenment, respectively) there came forth in Hegel the idea of 'evolutionistic
absoluteness' — an ingenious but untenable attempt to reconcile the solid apologetic
conception of absoluteness of that day with the dynamics of history by presenting it as the
outcome and terminus of historical progression. See Troeltsch, Die Absolutheit des Christen-
tums, 87ff. Cf. J. Klapwijk, Tussen historisme en relativisme, 222-29. At present the belief in
progress and thus also the mix of it with the idea of absoluteness is no longer a subject of
discussion.<br>

Abstract: David Bohm, op.cit. Bohm's insistence on an "implicate order" basically calls into question
the modern idea in quantum mechanics that the universe is fundamentally and ultimately
indeterminate. Bohm's cosmology would appear to be more in line with the Christian belief
that creation possesses an ultimate ground of all order in the Word of the Creator God. See
the theme issue of Zygon (Vol. 20, June, 1985) on "David Bohm's Implicate Order: Physics,
Philosophy and Theology" and especially Ted Peter's essay, "David's Bohm, Postmodernism,

direction see Ibid., p. 83, where Steen writes: "It might be said that structure tends to be
reduced to direction... Structure is transcendentally-directed meaning. Meaninglessness,
nothing, and meaning loss tend to occur when this direction is lost. The structure is almost its
pointing character." Steen finds in this state of affairs what he calls the "semi-contradictory
theme" in Dooyeweerd's thought.<br>

Abstract: In writing the last paragraphe and previous ones on double sensitivity in am indebted to
Soren Kierkegaard's notion of indirect communication, i.e., the idea that — in the current era
— we do not have immédiate access to truth ('from face to face') and that every understanding
of truth is necessarily mediated by the person's attitude to truth, which itself should be a mani-
festation of truth too.<br>

Abstract: Kearny (2007, 198) refers to the idea of zimzum (tzimtzum) in Jewish kabbalistic
thought. I think this reference takes us closer to (for instance) Levinas than to Desmond. To
pursue this link, see Dalton (2006). For parallel influences, see the 'theology' of the Frankfurt
School: contractio Dei was the topic of Habermas's doctoral dissertation; the theme is also very
much present in Hansjonas's theology: see Valk (2009).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Se revendiquant d'E. Betti dans le débat qu'il eut avec H.-G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman défend la possibilité de connaître avec certitude le sens objectif du Coran, qu'il dissocie du sens littéral. Ce sens objectif, qui correspond à l'intention divine, est pour ce réformiste indo-pakistanais en accord avec les valeurs universelles de la modernité. Or plusieurs intellectuels, dont le sud-africain Farid Esack, reprennent l'argument gadamérien de l'historicité de toute interprétation pour critiquer l'idée qu'une lecture puisse être objective. Ainsi, classique ou moderne, aucune interprétation ne serait dénuée de préjugés, et prétendre le contraire reviendrait à enfermer le Coran dans l'historicité du lecteur. Même si Rahman relativise son propos en rappelant la difficulté de la recherche de l'objectivité, le problème que pose son modernisme est qu'il risque de céder à l'illusion d'un islam véritable, authentique, qui arrêterait alors le mouvement de réinterprétation du texte. Taking a stand for E. Betti in the debate he had with H.G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman defends the possibility of knowing with certainty the objective meaning of the Quran, which differs from the literal sense. For the Indo-Pakistani reformist, this objective meaning, which corresponds to the divine intention, is in accordance with the universal values of modernity. Yet, many intellectuals, including South African Farid Esack, takes up the Gadamerian argument and plead for the historicity of any interpretation, criticizing the idea that an interpretation can be objective. In that view, be it classical or modern, no interpretation would be without prejudice, and pretending otherwise would confine the Quran to the historicity of the reader. Even if Rahman restates the difficulty of the search for objectivity, the problem of his modernism is that it may give the illusion of a real, authentic Islam, which then forecloses the dynamics of textual reinterpretation.

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Author(s): Morris Rosalind C.<br>
Abstract: This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it, the questions of language and law in Lévi-Straussian structuralism; (b) the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field at the time when it was being infused with different forms of poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought, respectively.<br>

Abstract: La réflexion offerte dans cet essai s'inscrit dans une entreprise d'approfondissement de la compréhension générale que nous avons de l'activité politique (parler, écrire, revendiquer, mettre en scène), et particulièrement de la relation que cette activité entretient avec l'idée de l'émancipation. Plus précisément, il s'agit de prendre pour objet d'exploration théorique le fait de parole, défini en termes d'articulation performative des espaces-temps humains, et d'en faire le paradigme de toute action politique. L'analyse de ce paradigme, au terme, permettra de pointer vers une matière utopique qui se qualifie à la fois comme événement et comme permanence du commun. /// In this article, the author seeks a better understanding of the modalities of political action (speaking, writing, claming, staging), and more specifically of the relation between political action and the idea of emancipation. To do so, the author proposes that the speech act, comprehended as the performed articulation of lived space/time, is to be taken as the paradigm of political action. Further analysis of this paradigm, as developed in the article, compels the manifestation of a philosophical object which qualifies both as event and as the manifestation of the perennially of the common.<br>

Abstract: The last two decades have been fascinating and productive ones for theorists of religion. Recent work has offered a remarkably wide range of theoretical perspectives and possibilities that enrich our field even as they plunge us into vigorous theoretical debates. Amidst this contest-even confusion-some basic principles for guiding future work seem to be asserting themselves. Many think that, after a century of confusion and intermingling between theology and the study of religion, scholars of religion are finally in a position to establish the study of religion on properly academic, theoretical foundations. In this story Eliade's antireductionist discourse of the "sacred" becomes the epitome and, it is hoped, the last gasp of religious studies as a quasi-theological discourse. Yet despite their efforts to guide the study of religion away from Eliade, many remain Eliadan insofar as they accept Eliade's "locative" approach to religion. Yet is it really "theology" that is currently limiting the way we "imagine religion," or might it be instead the refusal to think beyond religion's locative function-a refusal very closely linked to the desire for academic respectability in a historicist age? Mark C. Taylor's After God provocatively disturbs the idea that religion is primarily locative and, in doing so, also disturbs the boundaries between the theological and the theoretical, religion and the study of religion. I consider the significance of this virtual map of religion, by reading After God with and against J. Z. Smith's early reflections or experiments with the ideas of chaos, incongruity, and location. I argue that Taylor's book leads us back to paths from which Smith turned in his early work.<br>

Abstract: El artículo analiza las condiciones de validez del testimonio en ciencias sociales. Sus potencialidades centrales son el constituir un campo de exploración e investigación de acercamiento a la subjetividad, especialmente a la de los sectores populares. Ello ha permitido incorporar sus discursos y representaciones en las ciencias sociales. Sin embargo, dicha incorporación se ha realizado bajo una perspectiva empirista, según la cual el testimonio es una representación inmediata, directa de los sujetos, lo que oculta la mediación del testimonio a través del cientista social, particularmente mediante la entrevista. Por ende, la idea del testimonio como una "voz de los sin voz" oculta el diálogo entre investigador-sujetos, que podría ser potenciado en un tipo de investigación hermeneútica en la que el investigador ya no ostentaría el monopolio de la interpretación. This article analises the validity conditions of "testimony" as a methodological tool in the social sciences. The principal advantage of testimony is that it enables the construction of research and analysis of subjectivity, particularly with popular sectors. This has facilitated the incorporation of their discourses and representations into the social sciences. Notwithstanding, this incorporation has occurred within a highly empiricist perspective, whereby testimony is an immediate representation of the individual. The mediation of the social scientist, which is particularly significant in interviews, remains hidden. The concept of testimony, therefore, as the "voice of the voiceless" disguises the dialogue between the researcher and the individual. This dialogue could be further developed as an instrument of hermeneutical research, whereby the researcher no longer monopolises interpretations.<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose les éléments d'un cadre théorique permettant d'analyser des situations sociales comportant une part d'imprévisibilité. S'intéresser à des ruptures, des changements soudains, c'est en partie revenir sur de vieux tabous de la sociologie et plus généralement des sciences sociales: la contingence, l'événement, l'imprévisible. Une solution possible réside dans la définition précise de ce qui est considéré comme imprévisible et dans la prise en compte de différents niveaux de temporalité, à condition d'accepter l'idée que les temps « courts » peuvent parfois influer sur les temps « longs ». In this article I propose the elements of a theoretical framework that makes it possible to analyse social situations with a part of unpredictability. Being interested in ruptures, unexpected changes, is for a part going back to some old taboos of sociology, and more generally, of social sciences: contingency, events, unpredictability. One possible solution consists in a precise definition of what is considered as unpredictable and in taking into account different levels of temporality, providing to accept the idea that « short » time can sometimes have an influence on « long » time.<br>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a general study on the relationship between Nishida and Chinese philosophy. In the first, I explored the extent to which Nishida's philosophy was influenced, directly and indirectly, explicitly and implicitly, historically and conceptually, by materials coming from the intellectual horizon of Chinese thought. I concentrate here on Nishida's own position toward what he understood by "Chinese philosophy." Is this philosophy, so suggestive for Nishida, promoted to a central place in his work or not, and if so, in what sense might we take this idea of "centrality" as specifically Chinese? In setting forth several archetypes of Chinese thought present in Nishida's philosophy, the focus of this article falls on the methodological, logical and metaphysical contrasts we can identify between the Japanese philosopher and Chinese philosophy as his underground intellectual sources. 本稿は、筆者による西田幾多郎と中国哲学との関係を考察した研究論文の続編にあたる。前編の “Nishida Kitarō and Chinese Philosophy”は、西田哲学がどれだけの直接的もしくは間接的、明示的もしくは暗示的、歴史的もしくは概念的な影響を中国思想の知的土壊を基盤とする史料や人物から受けたかを考究したものである。続編である本稿では、西田が理解するところの中国哲学に対する西田自身の姿勢に焦点を絞る。この中国哲学なるものが西田の著作のなかで中心的な位置を占めているのかどうか、そうであるとするならば、この「中心」なる慨念を我々はどう理解すれば良いのか。本稿では、西田哲学に現れる中国思想の複数の原型を提示するとともに、西田という日本の哲学者と彼の知的背景としての中国哲学との間に認識できる、方法論的、論理的、形而上学的な対照に光を当てるものである。<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the ways in which Polish migrants in Ireland negotiate prevalent Polish discourses on migrant identity. The author emphasizes the complexity of migrant identity transgressions first, in order to displace a belief in a fixed homogeneity of the Polish migrant community, and secondly, to illustrate the problematics of young Polish migrants' relations with politically and culturally endorsed notions of Polishness, and, finally, to stress the need to engage migrant voices into the discussion on issues of Polish cultural and national identity. To that end the author analyzes two narratives of Polish migrants in Ireland which not only engage in contestation and negotiation of fixed identities but also emphasize the value of migration in shaping ideas about identity that transgress the idea of the nation as an absolute.<br>

Abstract: I take up the question of political identity as the continuity of a community across time. In particular, I examine what it means to think of a political community as the subject of attribution across generations, that is, what is meant when it is made the bearer of responsibility for the past and a custodian of the future. In doing that, I focus on identity, memory, and responsibility and discuss that cluster of concepts using as an illustrative example the idea of constitutional patriotism and its relationship to the past.<br>

Kolbe (1894-1941), son capaces e dar su vida por otros, sin pedir nada a cambio, sin furia y sin rencor, tan sólo porque su idea de Dios omprende a la humanidad. Kolbe murió en un «búnker de inanición» del campo de exterminio de uschwitz. Entregó voluntariamente su vida a cambio de la de otro prisionero que era padre de familia. l suplicio del hambre (inanición absoluta) duró catorce días, en los que fallecieron seis condenados; uego, una inyección letal liquidó a los tres moribundos restantes, que «tardaban» demasiado. Así acabó olbe. La pena se dictó como castigo colectivo por la fuga de otro preso del bloque

Abstract: The four most frequently cited communitarians, of course. See Charles Taylor, Sources
of The Se//(Cambridge, Mass., 1989); Michael Sandel, Liberalism and the Limits of Justice
(Cambridge, 1983); Michael Walzer, Spheres of Justice (New York, 1983); Alisdair
Maclntyre, After Virtue (London, 1981). It is worth pointing out, I think, that linking these
four in this way does grave damage to all of the thinkers concerned. Of the four just
mentioned only two, Walzer and Sandel, seem unworried by the use of the label 'commu-
nitarian' (which is more usually and — in some senses appropriately — applied to writers
such as Amitai Etzioni). Maclntyre has expressly repudiated the idea that he is a commu-
nitarian (see his 'Reply to my Critics', in After Maclntyre, ed. Susan Mendus and John
Horton (Cambridge, 1994)) and Taylor has also expressed his very considerable reserva-
tions (in his 'Cross Purposes: The Liberal-Communitarian debate', in Liberalism and the
Moral Life, ed. Nancy Rosenblum (Cambridge, Mass., 1989)). I discuss this problem in
more detail in Political Theory, Modernity and Postmodemity, especially in the introduc-
tion and Ch. 4.<br>

Abstract: Many Natural Law theorists thought that God could not rightly violate or alter
principles of justice, but argued instead that there must be independent moral grounds to
which even God would have to appeal for justification. Hugo Grotius expressed an early
form of the idea in 1625, in the Prolegomena to his De lure Belli ac Pads. Other Natural
Law theorists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, who expounded variations of
the doctrine, include Samuel von Pufendorf (De lure Nature et Gentium Librii Octo,
1672), Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (Principes du droit naturel, 1747), and Emerich de
Vattel (Le Droit des Gens, 1758). See A.P. d'Entrèves, Natural Law (London, 1951),
ch. 3; cf. Voltaire, 'Remerciement sincère à un homme charitable', in Vol. V of
Montesquieu's De l'Esprit des lois (Paris, 1816 [1750]), pp. 257-62. See also John
Haldane, 'Religious Toleration', Synthesis Philosophica, 17 (1994), pp. 21-6, pp. 24-5;

Publisher: Leo S. Olschki<br>
Issue: e26230922<br>
Date: 8 1, 2008<br>
Abstract: In 2008, as a follow-up to the initiative taken the previous year, ISRE – Istituto Superiore Regionale Etnografico
         [Superior Regional Ethnographic Institute]organized the seminarGramsci ritrovato, tra Cirese e i Cultural Studies(Nuoro, October 24th- 25th, 2008)[Gramsci rediscovered: between Cirese and the Cultural Studies]. The seminar focused on another ‘find’: the readings of Gramsci’s works on folklore that Cirese had elaborated thirty-eight years before. The idea came from Giorgio Baratta, who – in hisGramsci in contrappunto [Gramsci in counterpoint](Carocci 2008) – has given special attention to an analysis of Cirese’s essayConcezioni del mondo, filosofia spontanea e istinto di classe nelle “Osservazioni sul folklore” di Antonio Gramsci [World Views, Spontaneous Philosophy and Class Instinct in the “Observations On Folklore” by Antonio Gramsci](1970). Giulio Angioni’s and Pietro Clemente’s contributions – coming, in part, from an intellectual autobiography standpoint (they both have been Cirese’s students at first, and his colleagues later) – helped elucidate the method and the contents of Cirese’s work. They also dealt with Gramsci, in order to theoretically reconstruct the foundations of Italian folklore studies between the Sixties and the Seventies of XX Century. Baratta’s renewed reading, a part of which we here republish, together with Brigitte Wagner’s contribution (dedicated to the issue of the feasibility of translations of languages and cultures), give evidence to the prospect of a vitality of Cirese’s critical work outside the usual context of Italian folklore studies. Prospect and vitality that have been demonstrated by Cirese himself, who, during the 2008 seminar in Nuoro, was a protagonist of the dialogue with other scholars as well as with the public that intervened in the debate. He was a generous testimony of the large spectrum of his interests, mostly methodological, and he very carefully underlined, with respect to Gramsci, two aspect~<br>

Abstract: Here, we should beware of the English translation, which tends to reify the two Chinese
characters 仏教.Literally, they indicate “teachings [of the] Buddha,” or "Buddhist teachings，”
with a further step being their identification with "Buddhism." Like the concept of “religion”
that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century to translate a Western concept, there is a sub-
tle shift between the idea of "Buddhist teachings” and the further use of the same term to indi-
cate "Buddhism."<br>

Author(s): Vidler Ken<br>
Abstract: I focus on Nietzsche's architectural metaphor of self-construction in arguing for the claim that postmodern readings of Nietzsche misunderstand his various attacks on dogmatic philosophy as paving the way for acceptance of a self characterized by fundamental disunity. Nietzsche's attack on essentialist dogmatic metaphysics is a call to engage in a purposive self-creation under a unifying will, a will that possesses the strength to reinterpret history as a pathway to "the problem that we are". Nietzsche agrees with the postmodernists that unity is not a pre-given, however he would disavow their rejection of unity as a goal. Where the postmodernists celebrate "the death of the subject" Nietzsche rejects this valorization of disunity as a form of Nihilism and prescribes the creation of a genuine unified subjectivity to those few capable of such a goal. Postmodernists are nearer Nietzsche's idea of the Last Man than his idea of the Overman.<br>

Abstract: A number of investigators are agreed that the popular medical systems of tribal, peasant, and allied peoples are "effective." Most of the literature closely examining that effectiveness focuses on the ethnopharmacological dimensions of the healing systems and generally ignores psychosocial factors. Recent developments in psychophysiology may offer insights into these neglected areas. The specific idea to be examined here is that successful "general medical treatment," or "symbolic healing," by either the shaman or physician, is based in part on a psychosocial mobilization of the patient's biochemical response system. Moreover, it is argued that to account fully for these processes we must reconceptualize the character of the human organism; a unitary alternative to standard Western Cartesian dualism (mind vs. body) is proposed, based on a model derived from recent research in neuroendocrinology. This model can be the basis for a nonreductionist theory of medical effectiveness needed to account for a series of observations (derived from both anthropological and medical contexts) which seem to transcend the explanatory powers of the traditional reductionist biomedical model.<br>

Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Casey Edward<br>
Abstract: This essay begins by situating the work of David Carr in relation to the reception of phenomenology in the United States. It addresses Carr's early (and continuing) contributions to the philosophy of history, especially as this topic emerges in Husserl's middle and later writings. The idea of point of view as this emerges in Carr's own writings on history is examined, with special attention to differences between its spatial and temporal instantiations. Carr's emphasis on the primacy of temporality in human experience is contrasted with an approach that is more appreciative of the role of place in this experience. It is suggested that place offers an important alternative to time as a basis for the understanding of history and narrative.<br>

Abstract: El cuento de Borges es, según sus propias palabras, "una enorme adivinanza o
parábola cuyo tema es el tiempo". La idea central del argentino es plantear una con-
cepción del tiempo que no sea uniforme y absoluta, sino multiforme; un tiempo com-
puesto "por series infinitas de tiempos, en una corriente creciente y vertiginosa de
tiempos divergentes, convergentes o paralelos", "una trama del tiempo de los tiempos
que se aproximan, se bifurcan, se cortan o se ignoran durante siglos abarca todas las
posibilidades". J. L. Borges, "Le jardin des sentiers qui bifurquent", en Borges, Oeuvres
complètes, París, Gallimard, 1993, p. 507.<br>

Abstract: Tomamos esta expresión a Alessandro Cavalli, quien muestra en particular que la teo-
ría de la acción derivada del enfoque de las elecciones racionales presupone cierta estabilidad
de las preferencias del actor, y con ello construye teóricamente una estática de la acción polí-
tica. Al introducir la dimensión tiempo en la teoría de la acción, se le transforma en una di-
námica que integra la idea de inestabilidad de las preferencias en el trancurso del juego
político, esto es en el flujo de las acciones, interacciones y reacciones entre varios jugadores
que no son únicamente los Robinson Crusoe solitarios, sin identidades ni memorias, de la
teoría económica neoclásica. Alessandro Cavalli, "Tempo, azione, interazione, scambio:

Abstract: En la poesía de Pablo Neruda hay una preocupación por la muerte y una respuesta al tiempo que marca su avance. Esta respuesta se manifiesta en varios temas entre los cuales los más importantes son: la naturaleza, el compromiso político y el amor. En este artículo se examinan estos temas en dos de los últimos libros de Neruda, El mar y las campanas y Jardín de invierno y se compara la actitud de la voz lírica con actitudes en poemas anteriores. Se concluye que hay una nota pesimista que se introduce, como si, cerca de la muerte, el poeta dudara de la posibilidad de enfrentarse al tiempo. No se justifica, pues, la idea de que los poemas póstumos de Neruda nos dejan con un optimismo final. Más bien estos poemas demuestran la misma complejidad y las oposiciones presentes en su obra entre el poder del amor y el de la muerte, entre los dones de la naturaleza y su indiferencia, entre el papel público del poeta y el intimismo.<br>

Abstract: Cogito, as the first principle of Descartes' metaphysical system, initiated the modern philosophy of consciousness, becoming both the source and subject of modern Western philosophical discourse. The philosophies of Maine de Biran, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and others developed by answering the following questions? Is consciousness substantial or not? Does consciousness require the guarantee of a transcendental subject? Is Cogito epistemological or ontological? Am I a being-for-myself or a being-for-others? Outlining the developmental history of the idea of Cogito from Descartes to Sartre is important for totally comprehending the evolution and development of Western philosophy.<br>

Author(s): White Sheldon H.<br>
Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Publisher: Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group<br>
Issue: i30036245<br>
Date: 11 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Westlund Ingrid<br>
Abstract: Recently, a five-year trial period without a set timetable for compulsory school education in 79 municipalities was concluded in Sweden. The overall idea of the trial was to facilitate local participation, local time governance and flexible learning. Within the pilot trial, each individual pupil's school activities were supposed to be designed to suit his/her needs, interests and prerequisites. This article examines how teachers, principals and students describe students' schoolwork as being located in the intersection between school/home, work/leisure, time/task and individual/collective spheres. Three empirical studies indicate that the essential part of new temporal habits of school concerns a reconstructed task orientation. Time has been taken into the service of tasks and clocktime is not always a taken for granted regulator in educational settings. Potential disadvantages with a more task-oriented education are also discussed.<br>

Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur writes, "The idea of category mistake brings us close to our
goal. Can one not say that the strategy of language at work in metaphor consists in obliterating the
logical and established frontiers of language, in order to bring to light new resemblances the previous
classification kept us from seeing? In other words, the power of metaphor would be to break an old
categorization, in order to establish new logical frontiers on the ruins of their forerunners" (p. 197).

Date: 3 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Young Isabelle<br>
Abstract: L'article fait le point sur la crise de la totalisation en ethnographie et sur les perspectives qui s'offrent actuellement pour la dépasser. Il résume les grandes lignes de l'ethnographie " intégrative " qui s'est constituée dans le prolongement de l'anthropologie sociale et culturelle, autour de l'idée de totalisation monographique. Puis il discute la critique qui en a été faite et les nouvelles formes de rapports entre enquête et écriture qui ont été explorées dans les démarches narratives. Il envisage enfin, sous le terme d'ethnographie " combinatoire ", les pratiques d'enquête qui se sont mises en place dans le cadre de l'interactionnisme puis des développements récents de la sociologie de l'action. Partant de la question de la totalisation des données dans chacune de ces trois formes d'empirie ethnographique, il caractérise les différentes formes d'altérité ainsi constituées dans le cours de l'enquête. /// This article considers the crisis of totalisation in ethnography and the perspectives that are currently available to overstep it. It summarizes the major lines of "integrative ethnography" which has developed as a prolongation of social and cultural anthropology, around the idea of monographical totalisation. The article goes on to discuss the criticism it received and the new types of relation between survey and wiriting that have been explored in the narrative approach. It then imagines ethnographical practice which, by distinguishing between generalisation and totalisation, is put into place in the light of interactionism, then recent developments of action sociology. /// Der Aufsatz berichtet über den heutigen Stand der Totalisierungskrise in der Ethnographie und über die heute bestehende Aussichten, Fortschritte zu verzeichnen. Er ist eine Zusammenfassung der großen Linien der "integrativen" Ethnographie, die in der Verlängerung der Sozial- und Kulturanthropologie um den Gedanken einer monographischen Totalisierung entstanden ist.

Article Title: How to Overcome Ethnocentrism: Approaches to a Culture of Recognition by History in the Twenty-First Century<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369550<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
Abstract: Much international and intercultural discourse about historiography is influenced by a way of historical thinking deeply rooted in human historical consciousness and that works throughout all cultures and in all times: ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric history conceives of identity in terms of "master-narratives" that define togetherness and difference as essential for identity in a way that causes tension and struggle. These narratives conceive of history in terms of "clashes of civilizations," and they reinforce the idea that international and intercultural relations are merely struggles for power. The main elements of ethnocentrism are: asymmetrical evaluation, teleological continuity, and centralized perspective. This essay articulates possibilities for overcoming these three elements by replacing asymmetrical evaluation with normative equality; teleological continuity with reconstructive concepts of development that emphasize contingency and discontinuity; and centralized perspectives with multi-perspectivity and polycentric approaches to historical experience. Adopting these possibilities would lead to a new mode of universal history rooted in a concept of humankind that can help solve the problem of ethnocentrism. This idea of humankind conceptualizes the unity of the human species as being manifest in a variety of cultures and historical developments. This is in fact the traditional concept of historicism, which can be further developed towards a historiography that responds to the challenges of globalization and cultural differences. The essay outlines theoretical and methodological means in historical studies that bring this idea of humankind into the work of historians, thus enabling them to contribute to a new culture of recognition. The article is based on the assumption that the creation of such a culture is the most important task of scholarly work in the humanities in general, and historical studies in particular, at the beginning of the twenty-first centu~<br>

Abstract: In Orientalism, Edward Said attempts to show that all European discourse about the Orient is the same, and all European scholars of the Orient complicit in the aims of European imperialism. There may be "manifest" differences in discourse, but the underlying "latent" orientalism is "more or less constant." This does not do justice to the marked differences in approach, attitude, presentation, and conclusions found in the works of various orientalists. I distinguish six different styles of colonial and postcolonial discourse about India (heuristic categories, not essential types), and note the existence of numerous precolonial discourses. I then examine the multiple ways exponents of these styles interact with one another by focusing on the early-twentieth-century nationalist orientalist, Sri Aurobindo. Aurobindo's thought took form in a colonial framework and has been used in various ways by postcolonial writers. An anti-British nationalist, he was by no means complicit in British imperialism. Neither can it be said, as some Saidians do, that the nationalist style of orientalism was just an imitative indigenous reversal of European discourse, using terms like "Hinduism" that had been invented by Europeans. Five problems that Aurobindo dealt with are still of interest to historians: the significance of the Vedas, the date of the vedic texts, the Aryan invasion theory, the Aryan-Dravidian distinction, and the idea that spirituality is the essence of India. His views on these topics have been criticized by Leftist and Saidian orientalists, and appropriated by reactionary "Hindutva" writers. Such critics concentrate on that portion of Aurobindo's work which stands in opposition to or supports their own views. A more balanced approach to the nationalist orientalism of Aurobindo and others would take account of their religious and political assumptions, but view their project as an attempt to create an alternative language of discourse. Although in need of criticism in th~<br>

Author(s): Wrigley Trevor J.<br>
Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Abstract: Un jour viendra. Car l'Histoire a un sens, qu'on peut infléchir. L'engagement est né de cette représentation fondatrice du radicalisme moderne, confirmé et sublimé par 1789. Mais il fallut ensuite apprendre à vivre le temps de la "séparation ouvrière". Jusqu'au nouveau remaniement de la scène sociale avec l'affaire Dreyfus, en prélude aux fureurs et aux drames du 20e siècle. Voici la toile de fond de cette histoire violente que nous explorons dans ce numéro, et qui n'a pas répondu à la question qui hante, encore et toujours: que faire? /// The idea of direct intervention, which goes back to Early Modern times and thrived during the Enlightenment, is at the root of political commitment. It remained, however, restricted in scope and more attentive to he rights of Man than to social concerns. In the course of the nineteenth-century, by contrast, the social question came to the fore as writers tended to eulogize the People. But the autonomy of the workers movement, readily anti-intellectual, confined nineteenth-century writers to the secondary role of "road companions", which in turn freed them for the task of upholding justice, as in the Dreyfus Affair. All these mutations, of causes, actors, projects and behaviors, outlined complex configurations reflecting changes in attitudes to time, to space and to ways of envisioning the future. Nineteenth-century experiences help us to better understand the various forms, both fleeting and vigorous, of contemporary commitents.<br>

Abstract: L'étude de l'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam (1965-1973) permet de mettre en évidence les tensions existant entre la sphère du religieux et celle du politique, au sein d'un groupe de catholiques engagés, au cours de la décennie marquée par mai 68. Au début de la guerre du Vietnam, en février 1965, cette revue catholique, dirigée par des Franciscains bordelais, prend une position originale dans les milieux chrétiens: elle condamne très rapidement et très fermement l'intervention américaine. Ses rédacteurs "témoignent" en faveur du peuple vietnamien et dénoncent, en termes marxistes-léninistes, l'impérialisme américain. A travers les analyses, les prises de positions et les actions de "Frères du Monde" à propos du Vietnam, c'est le glissement vers le gauchisme d'une fraction minoritaire de la gauche chrétienne que l'on peut observer. Après 1968, le discours de la revue sur la guerre du Vietnam perd toute référence religieuse pour devenir, apparemment, exclusivement politique. Il reflète cependant une évolution théologique qui conduit des Franciscains, destinés à l'origine à la Mission, vers une théologie de la Libération, en gestation, à la même époque, en Amérique latine. L'engagement de "Frères du Monde" contre la guerre du Vietnam prend fin prématurément en septembre 1971. Alors que les combats redoublent de violence, la rédaction de la revue ne s'exprime plus sur cette guerre. En proie à des divisions internes, la revue disparaît au cours de l'année 1973. /// The study of "Frères du Monde's" commitment against the Vietnam War brings to the fore the tensions existing between the religious field and the political one, within a group of politically involved Catholics during the decade around May 1968. At the beginning of the Vietnam War, in February 1965, this Catholic review, published by a Franciscan friary from Bordeaux, takes an original stand among Christian circles: it quickly and firmly comdemns the American military intervention.

Author(s): Campbell Heather<br>
Abstract: The development of the intellectual basis for planning activity has been a slow and problematic process. This paper seeks to build on existing intellectual understanding to argue that future developments in planning thought must take questions of ethical value as their starting point. The paper is essentially divided into three parts. The first makes the important distinction between planning as a narrow set of regulatory practices and planning as an idea, or more particularly a long-enduring societal activity. It is the latter concept of planning that frames the discussion in the remainder of the paper. The second, in which the core of the argument is developed, explores the nature of planning as an activity; an activity that is centrally concerned with making ethical judgements about better and worse, with and for others, in just institutions. It is about an idea of value. The third section examines the implications of this perspective for planning as a subject of academic endeavour. The argument is illustrated throughout with examples drawn from the author's research.<br>

Abstract: El cambio social, ¿es realizado por actores/agentes (=sujetos, individuales y supraindividuales), o bien por determinismos colectivos (como estructuras y sistemas)?, ¿o tal vez por una combinación cualquiera entre actores y mecanismos sociales? Las teorías sociológicas, desde el Ochocientos hasta hoy, se han dividido en dos grandes campos: a) Por un lado, han habido teorías que han adoptado un "paradigma olístico". b) Por otro, han emergido teorías que, juzgando las primeras como infectadas de determinismo, han elaborado un "paradigma accionista". Muchos autores han mezclado o combinado juntos ora una, ora otra de estas posturas sin lograr encontrar un punto de vista capaz de integrarlas o trascenderlas. El resultado es que, hoy, la mayor parte de las teorías oscilan entre el primer y el segundo paradigma, o bien tratan de comprender el cambio social a través de mezclas o "fórmulas combinatorias" entre las dos. La tesis del autor es que ni las teorías sistémicas (olísticas) ni las accionísticas (individualistas) ni sus combinaciones pueden encontrar una "comprensión adecuada" del cambio social. Ofrecen visiones parciales de la historia, que son insuficientes en tanto que comparten una carencia común: la idea de que la relación social sea un resultado (un efecto) de "otras" variables en juego, como las estructuras sociales o --por el contrario-- la subjetividad individual, o bien un determinismo en sí misma. Para comprender el cambio social se precisa de una teoría adecuada al carácter relacional de la realidad social, como realidad sui generis "hecha de" relaciones sociales. Se propone aquí un paradigma, denominado "relacional", según el cual el cambio social consiste en la "emergencia" de realidades sociales movidas por sujetos (individuales y colectivos) queestán en relación entre ellos en un determinado sentido. "Comprender" signifìca "relacionarse" con todo lo que tal relación (¡social!) significa y comporta. En la parte final se trata de ejemplificar las potenc~<br>

Abstract: This article aims to explore aspects of the construction by scientific practice of historical-cultural differences. It aims as well to suggest ways to approach ethnic phenomena considering the need to place them historically, and to focus the cultural and political dimensions in new terms; in the challenge that ethnicity represents to today's world. The confrontation with humanity as 'the others' that is talked about, is partial. It is not with all 'humanity' but only with a part of it—substantial indeed—, a 'humanity' with specifities placed in a world divided in ethnocentric and unequal modes. This is the world that Geertz embraces what is 'not properly ours.' We can ask ourselves what is exactly 'properly ours' for those who say it. I add some obvious but forgotten dimensions: the place of the observer, the characteristics of the society where the perceptions and construction of otherness originate and are reproduced. Nowadays the idea of the importance of the 'racial factor', is newly again reinforced. Like in the United States and now in Europe. These differences, more than having a physical or cultural referent, have to do with the dimension of power and with social differences. Ethnicity has never been translated in only one discourse. Therefore, ethnicity should be seen as a process whose meanings can only be understood in context, evolving in the course of history in the specific social circumstances of a given people. Even more, the development of ethnic and class processes in the same social formation adds to the complexity of ethnic processual nature. The articulation of these two processes—ethnicity and class— and their contradictions can only be aprehended by observing the historical dimension in which these take place. By underlining the temporal depth of social processes, the 'ethnographic present' is displaced from this centre of analysis to be come 'a moment' in this processual flow. From this perspective ethnic phenomena are not anymore mere 'acci~<br>

Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of the songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-1979), hoping thereby to better understand the ideology of the Khmer Rouge as it relates to aesthetic and the degree to which such an aesthetic may be related to the abuses of power associated with the period. The article summarizes what is known about how the songs were generated and used: on radio broadcasts, at political meeting, and as part of revolutionary theater. It discusses the social implications of the ways the songs were used in meetings and at work sites, and the power generated by the fact that the songs were used to the exclusion of earlier kinds of songs. Finally, the article analyzes three songs found in Khmer Rouge song books, in terms of the attitudes expressed toward nature, labor, youth, and the relationship of the sexes. It explores the idea of irony, and how the "meaning" of the songs may have been tinged with greater and greater irony in relation to the changing reality of the Cambodian revolution.<br>

Abstract: A filosofia prática de Kant, ou seja, o nuclear da sua ética, juntamente com o "primado da razão prática sobre a especulativa" e a "religião nos limites da simples razão", com seu acento no "mal radical", têm inegáveis afinidades com a - e em certos casos influxo da - tradição cristã. O próprio Kant terá em alguns momentos reconhecido isso mesmo. Segundo o autor do presente texto, subsistem, contudo, inegáveis divergências. O artigo, escrito a partir de uma declarada 'simpatia metódica, pretende precisar no possível o alcance de umas e de outras, fazendo sobre o tema um balanço positivo. O autor propõe ainda uma hipótese de leitura do Opus Postumum, reconhecendo aqui uma tentativa por parte de Kant no sentido de purificar o seu "teísmo moral" numa direcção que tão pouco é alheia a importantes intuições cristãs. /// Aim of the article is to show that the practical philosophy of Kant, or, in other terms, the core of his ethics, as is the case with the "primacy of the practical reason over the speculative one" and the "religion within the limits of pure reason", with its accent set upon the idea of "radical evil", have undeniable affinities with -and in certain cases influxes from - the Christian tradition. Kant himself seems to have recognized that much at certain moments. For the author of the article, however, there are a few divergences to be reckoned with. In fact, the article, which is clearly written from the standpoint of a declared methodic sympathy, does whatever is possible in order to determine the reach of the ones and of the others, but in the end concludes that the result is a positive one. The author also suggests a reading hypothesis for the Opus Postumum, acknowledging here an attempt on the part of Kant directed towards a purification of his "moral theism" in a direction that as such is no less close to some very important Christian intuitions.<br>

Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Arguing that the times of scientistic criticism of psychoanalysis are past and that psychoanalysis is now open to new intellectual and scientific horizons, the article aims at showing how the recent developments of neurobiology, cognitive psychology, as well as new theories of therapeutic change in psychoanalysis support a reformulation of the psychoanalytic unconscious. The author defends that the obvious terminological confusion between the neurobiological and cognitive non-conscious on the one hand and the dynamic unconscious, on the other, require clear definitions of differences and of commonalities. Furthermore, the author also develops the idea that the dimensions of awareness and of selfascription (avowal/disavowal) help to determine what is the core of the dynamic unconscious, even though the cognitive non-conscious and the psychoanalytic unconscious overlap to a great extent. The article shows, finally, how a new interdisciplinary consensus offers now a chance for us to recognize the shortcomings of a rationalistic philosophy of mind. /// Argumentando que os tempos de uma crítica da psicanálise a partir do cientismo já passaram e que a psicanálise está agora aberta a novos horizontes intelectuais e científicos, o artigo pretende mostrar até que ponto os desenvolvimentos mais recentes da neurobiologia, da psicologia cognitiva bem como das novas teorias da mudança terapêutica em psicanálise suportam uma reformulação do inconsciente psicanalítico. O autor defende que a óbvia confusão terminológica entre o não-consciente neurobiológico e cognitivo por um lado e o inconsciente dinâmico por outro requerem definições claras das diferenças e dos aspectos comuns. Além disso, o autor desenvolve também a ideia de que as dimensões de conhecimento e de auto-atribuição (reconhecimento/nãoreconhecimento) ajudam a determinar aquilo que constitui o cerne do inconsciente dinâmico, mesmo que o não-consciente cognitivo e o inconsciente psicanalítico se sobreponham em grande m~<br>

Abstract: For over twenty years, Richard Kearney has insisted that theology must not follow traditional metaphysical itineraries along paths that offer perspectives on God as Being Itself, or as Pure Act, or as causa sui. Instead, it should chart avenues that lead through the poetics of imagination, past the synthesizing dynamics of narrative, and toward the destination of God as a God that privileges potentiality over actuality. In constant dialogue with deconstructive and postmodern theories, Kearney has developed an "onto-eschatological hermeneutics" of the "God Who May Be" that presents a post--metaphysical, perhaps even more biblical, interpretation of God as divine possibility. This paper investigates Kearney's "onto-eschatological" poetics of God as it relates to his imaginative theological method and to the Pauline notion of kenosis as the risk of divine love. It concludes by associating Kearney's theopoetics with Kierkegaard's idea of repetition as a cipher for understanding the kinetics of the God Who May be as an alternative to the traditional metaphysical structures of God as a static "I Am Who I Am." /// Desde há mais de vinte anos que Richard Kearney vem insistindo em que a teologia deveria deixar de seguir os itinerdrios metafísicos tradicionais, ou seja, deveria deixar para trás os caminhos metafísicos que oferecem perspectivas sobre Deus enquanto Ser-mesmo, Acto Puro, ou causa sui. Em vez disso, a teologia deveria antes seguir caminhos orientados por uma poética da imaginação, para além da dinâmica sintetizadora da narrativa e em direcção a uma noção de Deus que privilegia a potencialidade sobre a actualidade. Num diálogo constante com as teorias desconstructoras e pós-modernas, Richard Kearney desenvolveu uma "hermenêutica ôntico-escatológica" do "Deus que pode ser", hermenêutica essa que nos oferece uma interpretação pós-metafísica, talvez mesmo mais bíblica, de Deus como divina possibilidade. O presente artigo investiga a poética "ontico-escatológica" de D~<br>

Abstract: A lo largo del siglo XX, la novela argentina desarrolla una poética literaria que concibe a la palabra creadora como posibilidad de salvación existencial. Esta idea de la literatura, que tiene en la obra del uruguayo Juan Carlos Onetti su más pura y lúcida expresión, se encuentra también en los fundamentos poéticos de otros grandes narradores rioplatenses contemporáneos. En el presente trabajo se analizan tres novelas—de Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Marechal y Abel Posse, respectivamente—para apreciar la continuidad y rica diversidad de sentidos que adopta esta poética en la narrativa argentina de nuestro tiempo. /// All through the XIX Century, the Argentine novel develops a literary poetics which views the creative word as the possibility for existential salvation. This idea of literature, which finds its purest and most lucid expression in the Uruguayan J. C. Onetti is also present in the poetic fundaments of other great contemporary narrators of the River Plate. In the prsent study, the noveh of A. Arl, L. Marechal, and Abel Posse are analyzed, with a view to establishing the continuity as well as the diversity of meanings adopted by this poetas in the Argentine fiction of our own times.<br>

Abstract: The modernisation theories developed in the 50s and 60s suggested that societies were converging toward modern values, gradually abandoning their traditional values. This convergence idea is re-examined in the following article within the context of European countries and on the basis of processed Values surveys. A set of attitude scales was constructed and then analysed through multivariate techniques. Two main results emerge from this analysis. First, it appears that, regardless of date and country, the Europeans' values are still structured around a traditionalism axis. This result obviously contradicts the theories of convergence towards modernity, theories that are strongly criticised. It is also an opportunity to reflect on the counterpart of traditionalism -need it be called "modernity"?- and on the relations between economic and moral attitudes. Second, religiosity is strongly linked to this structuring of values but it mainly opposes European members of whatever religious denomination to non-members, rather than -as is often imagined-Catholics to Protestants. All in all, the tension between tradition and modernity remains at the core of the value system of European societies.<br>

Abstract: No centro do presente artigo está a problemática kierkegaardiana do possível e do impossível, ou seja, a coexistência dos opostos como explicitação do paradoxo, uma das figuras matriciais do Absurdo. Para Kierkegaard, o homem singular vê-se confrontado com o Paradoxo precisamente na medida em que a sua existência não cai sob o domínio da metafísica e do estético. Por outras palavras, o paradoxo invade a existência humana no momento em que se trata do paradoxo absoluto, escândalo para o Judeu, loucura para o Grego, absurdo para a Razão. O artigo mostra, contudo, que antes de se confrontar com o Paradoxo, o existente precisa de aprender a esperar, malgrado o absurdo, na certeza de que tudo é possível a Deus. Porém, a experiência do Paradoxo implica percorrer um caminho prévio. Por outras palavras, é necessário aprender a experimentar a "condensação do possível", seja sob a forma de melancolia seja sob a forma do escrúpulo, de modo a poder desesperar da ideia do possível. Mostra-se assim a capacidade inovadora de Kierkegaard, mesmo sabendo nós que o desespero constitui um tema filosófico clássico já deste a Antiguidade. O que Kierkegaard faz, porém, é colocar em movimento uma dialéctica em que o jogo dos opostos se organiza em diversas figuras precárias, sempre incertas e fluentes e que se escalonam segundo degraus múltiplos de intensidade. Ora é precisamente graças a este jogo de oposições que no pensamento do Solitário de Copenhaga se articulam, ainda que de forma frágil, o finito e o infinito, o temporal e o eterno, a possibilidade e a necessidade. /// At the center of the present article is the kierhegaardian approach to the dialectic of the possible and the impossible, whose co-existence gives evidence to the Paradox, one of the figures of the Absurd. For Kierkegaard, the singular human being finds herself confronted with the Paradox precisely in the measure in which her existence does not fall under the dominion of metaphysics and of the aesthetical. The paradox ~<br>

Abstract: Las reflexiones filosófico-políticas de este ensayo discuten la idea de que la política se fundamenta en la mentira. En contra de esta creencia generalizada, el autor afirma que, si fuera el caso, ni la política ni la democracia serían posibles. Aún más: se postula que la política y la mentira son incompatibles. En el texto se abogan, entonces, por la verdad como fundamento de una cultura de transparencia en la democracia, que ciudadanos, políticos y funcionarios públicos —es decir, todos aquellos preocupados por el interés público— deben compartir y fomentar si es que no quieren poner en riesgo la salud de la república. La mentira como práctica diaria en la polis pone en peligro la transición a la democracia al socavar las bases de la solidaridad civil y de la constitución de un Estado de derecho. /// The philosophical-political considerations of this essay discuss the idea that politics is founded upon lying. Against this widespread belief, the author argues that, if this is true, neither politics nor democracy would be possible. Again, he states that politics and lying are incompatible. The text defends the idea that in a democracy truth is the foundation of a culture of transparency, which citizens, politicians, and officials, i.e., all those concerned with the public interest, must share and foster if they want to safeguard public well being. Lying as a daily practice in public life (polis) endangers democratic transitions by undermining the basis of civil solidarity and the rule of law.<br>

Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
Abstract: This article makes a contribution to hermeneutic explorations in global politics. Taking as its points of departure the growing body of work on film and the turn to aesthetic and intertextual IR, the article argues that a further conversation with cinema and poetics can be used to develop the interpretive canon in global politics. In particular, the analysis draws upon the idea of cinematic poetics, and more generally the work of Andrei Tarkovsky, who, throughout his films and written work, articulates a particular form of Russian interpretivism. The article explores Tarkovskian cinema and engages in debates about artistic creativity and aesthetics, filmic representations of belonging and spiritualism, all shaped by a Russian hermeneutic tradition. The final sections apply these themes, illustrating how the icon presents a way to read the themes of suffering and salvation, inscribing the formation of identities in global politics.<br>

Abstract: The attempt to write extreme violence, or to reco[r]d[e] traumatic cultural memory - the representation of horror - tests both the representational capacity of language and the rationality of subjecthood. Much narrative endeavour is spent trying to narrativise or 'structure' horror into story. However, because traumatic memories resist the narrative framework of the novel, questions are posed not only about the reliability of the narrator's memory and his/her ability to narrate a credible story, but also about the suitability of the fictional form of the novel to represent historical events such as extreme violence. How does language in narrative, with its insistence on order and sequence, 'capture' the destructuring nature of violence? Where is the subject or the idea of rational subjectivity in these de-structuring acts of violence? I will attempt to address these issues through a critical 'reading' of Moses Isegawa's novels Abyssinian Chronicles (2000) and Snakepit (2004). In these novels, Isegawa recasts and reenacts a period of recent Ugandan history marked by violence and chaos, emanating from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. However, both novels stretch the limits of 'factual' or historical credulity, reminding the reader that they are in fact works of historical fabrication. I am of the view that the narrative endeavour in these two novels is not only to record the chaotic events experienced during the years before and after the fall of Idi Amin, but to recode, through the tropes of language (symbol, imagery, and metaphor), the devastating effects of those years on the literary landscape of Uganda.<br>

Abstract: En partant de quelques transformations sodétales majeures, et en s'appuyant sur la fiction romanesque française, l'article dessine deux grandes constellations imaginaires de la mobilité dans la modernité. La première associe le but du déplacement, l'existence d'un ailleurs, le goût de l'aventure, l'attitude de départ actif et le rôle de la mobilité comme logique de pouvoir. La deuxième, souvent en résonance avec les items précédents, souligne plutôt l'exigence de la mobilité pour la mobilité, la fin de l'idée de dehors, l'impératif de la fuite, la prolifération de l'expérience du départ passif, enfin, la centralité croissante de la mobilité dans le saisissement de la domination. Au terme de ce parcours, l'imaginaire de la mobilité apparaît comme une boussole privilégiée pour cerner les transformations de la modernité. The article tracks two major imaginary constellations of modem mobility, through the analysis of important social transformations, illustrated by certain French novels. The first joins the goal of mobility, the existence of an « elsewhere » , the taste for adventure, an active departure, and the role of mobility as a logic of power. The second, frequently in relationship with the precedent, emphasizes the idea of mobility for itself, the end of elsewhere Utopia, the need to run away, the multiplication of experiences of passive departure, and finally the growing link between mobility and domination. The mobility imaginary appears at last as a privileged compass to surround the transformations of modernity.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the social meaning of songs written and performed during the revolutionary Democratic Kampuchea period in Cambodia (1975-79). After discussing how songs were generated and used, and the social implications they projected in meetings and at work sites, the article analyzes three songs and their attitudes toward nature, labor, youth, and relationships between the sexes. The idea of irony, and how the songs may have taken on increasing irony in the context of the harsh reality of the Cambodian revolution, is explored.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: To see, to speak, to think : these are the three main topics of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, tragically interrupted in 1961. He intended to write two works on The Origin of Truth. To understand the relationship between Merleau-Ponty I and Merleau-Ponty II it is a good lead to pay attention to the relationship between seeing, speaking and thinking. In a central passage of Phenomenology of Perception (p. 451) this relationship is called Fundierung. Merleau-Ponty conceives it as a two way relationship, which excludes every possibility of reducing one term (thinking, reason) to another (perception, language). Yet, at that time he is not able to point out clearly the originality of thinking. L'Oeil et l'Esprit and Le Visible et l'Invisible provide a first outline of l'Origine de la Vérité. The 'second' Merleau-Ponty wants to 'reassume' his whole philosophy in what he calls : fundamental thinking. Painting opens the way to the mystery of seeing : something visible begins to see. Subject and object are no longer opposed to one another ; not even related by intentionality. The new key-word is Ineinander (interrelatedness, to be in one another, chiasm). 'La chair' (the flesh) is a new notion, broader and more fundamental than the body. The sensible reflects upon itself. This 're-flection' (reflexivity or reversibility) is a work of Being. The visible can be seen in principle. Philosophy should accompany the coming-to-see of the visible. In this perspective the transition to thinking (or ideality) must be seen as a new case of 'reversibilité'. The generality of the visible opens up to the 'invisible', that which in principle cannot be seen, but is 'the other side' of the visible. The basic phenomenon of expression is central here. Language is not an absolute starting point. Language is rather a new and more subtile form of coporeity, a new instance of the same basic reversibility, which already contains the seeds of ideality (logos endiathetor). The idea is of the word (logos ~<br>

Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Article Title: Le principe d'équité comme « âme de l'herméneutique » (Georg Friedrich Meier)<br>

Abstract: Longtemps méconnue, l'herméneutique universelle des Lumières connaît actuellement un regain considérable d'intérêt. Après une caractérisation générale du profil de cette herméneutique, l'étude se focalise sur le Précis d'herméneutique de G.F. Meier, en prenant pour guide la thèse que le principe d'équité herméneutique forme l'âme de toute herméneutique qui se veut philosophique. Même s'il paraît difficile de faire encore de ce principe la clé de voûte épistémologique de l'herméneutique, les thèses de Meier relatives à ce principe conservent toute leur actualité, notamment dans les débats anglo-saxons récents relatifs au « principle of charity », de même qu'elles montrent la voie à une éthique de l'interprétation. The triumph of the romantic paradigm of hermeneutics as a general theory of understanding has partially hidden the former general hermeneutics of the Enligthment. In the current discussion about radical interpretation, we have good reasons to rediscover this older model. G.F. Meier's idea of a general hermeneutics including natural as well as artificial signs is under this respect of a special interest. The article focusses on Meier's statement that the principle of hermeneutic equity is the soul of a philosophical hermeneutics. Although it is impossible to maintain this principle as the epistemological foundation of hermeneutics, it shows the way toward an ethics of interpretation, which shades a new light on the debates regarding the so-called « principle of charity ».<br>

Author(s): Abel Olivier<br>
Abstract: L'article analyse l'idée de crédibilité et la façon dont elle est parfois suffoquée par l'incroyable assurance avec laquelle certaines paroles écrasent les autres. C'est que la crédibilité est indissociable de la manière de faire place aux autres, de prendre en compte leur réceptivité. On s'attache ici à l'exemple incertain d'un pardon qui ne suffoquerait pas la voix ordinaire, au sens de Cavell. The author analyzes the idea of credibility, and shows how our credibility may get literaly suffocated by the arrogance of some words, which deaden and crush other words. One must, then, understand the insepararablity of credibility from a way to make room for others, to take into account others' own receptivity. The author takes up the uncertain example of a way of forgiving that would avoid the suffocation of what Cavell defines as our ordinary voice.<br>

Author(s): Melcer Alain<br>
Abstract: Juriste de formation logicienne, longtemps influencé par le positivisme logique, Chaim Perelman a d'abord pensé qu'il était possible d'étendre l'analyse du raisonnement formel à l'argumentation pratique, juridique et morale. L'abandon de ce projet est ce qui l'a conduit à redécouvrir la topique juridique et à proposer, sous le titre de « nouvelle rhétorique », un retour à la Rhétorique et aux Topiques d'Aristote. As a jurist with a background in logics who was influenced by logical positivism for a long time, Chaim Perelman first thought that the analysis of formal reasoning could be extended to practical argumentation in the field of law and ethics. Renouncing this idea was what allowed him to rediscover juridical topics and to go back to Aristotle's Topics and Rhetorics under the name of « new rhetorics ».<br>

Publisher: École des Hautes Études Commerciales<br>
Issue: i40047561<br>
Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Cova Bernard<br>
Abstract: The proposition is that arts marketing should be conceived of as a dedicated field of endeavour so that consumers' immersion in the artistic experience occurs even in the case of a "difficult" art work. The focus is artistic experience-related phenomena. The authors introduce the concept of appropriation and then develop an appropriation cycle construct. Empirical research comprises introspective reports on consumer attendance at classical music concerts. The results show that the artistic experience is predicated on multiple rather than one-time immersion, and that full immersion may never occur. The authors conclude that those service elements that affect the way in which consumers experience an arts event should be managed throughout the appropriation process. Les auteurs proposent de concevoir le marketing des arts comme un domaine d'activité spécifique, afin que l'immersion des consommateurs dans l'expérience artistique soit possible même dans le cas d'une œuvre « difficile » . L'accent est mis sur les phénomènes liés à l'expérience artistique. Ils présentent le concept d'appropriation, puis développent un construit du cycle d'appropriation. Ils ont recours à la recherche empirique, soit les rapports d'analyse introspective des consommateurs ayant assisté à des concerts de musique classique. Les résultats indiquent que l'expérience artistique suppose de multiples immersions, non pas une seule, et que l'immersion totale risque de ne jamais se produire. Les auteurs concluent que les éléments du service qui influent sur l'expérience individuelle d'un événement artistique devraient être gérés tout au long du processus d'appropriation. Los autores proponen la idea de que el márketing de las artes debe concebirse como un emprendimiento en sí mismo, a fin de lograr la inmersión del consumidor en experiencia artística incluso en el caso de obras de arte "difíciles". El acento, entonces, está puesto en los fenómenos que se vinculan con la experiencia artística. Los auto~<br>

Abstract: Il s'agit d'éclairer plusieurs déplacements qui se sont produits dans les trente dernières années. Tout d'abord la création d'un milieu d'experts intermédiaires entre la politique, l'administration et la recherche. Ensuite un changement du cadre à l'intérieur duquel se situe la réflexion. Il s'agit moins de penser la cohésion d'une société dans un cadre national qu'à la manière dont le pays peut maintenir son rang dans la compétition internationale. Enfin un changement d'orientation politique : le souci de la formation de l'élite redevient primordial même s'il ne s'agit plus de maintenir une tradition culturelle mais de sauvegarder ses parts de marché. Le texte étudie ces évolutions en France en distinguant trois périodes : une période de « politique à l'état gazeux » où la gauche tente de transformer les idéaux libertaires de 1968 en programme de gouvernement ; une tentative de passage à l'état solide avec la loi d'orientation de 1989 et la création de la Direction de l'évaluation et de la prospective ; une déstabilisation de ce système par le ministre Claude Allègre qui jette le système éducatif français dans le grand bain de la concurrence internationale. Il s'ensuit une période à la fois « sous influence » et d'incertitude. The idea is to explain several moves that have happened in the last thirty years. First of all, the creation of a body of experts, middlemen between politics, government and research. Then a change in the setting of the thinking process. It is less to think about social cohesion within a national setting than the way the country can live up to its ranking when competing at the international level. Finally, a change in political orientations: teaching the elite becomes a crucial problem again even if it does not mean keeping cultural traditions alive any more but securing market shares. This article studies those changes and defines three periods: firstly, a period of politics in "gaseous-state" in which the left tried to change 1968's liberta~<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions f~<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: O artigo tem por objectivo mostrar até que ponto o princípio de subjectividade presente na Escola Austríaca de Economia se revela fundamentado na tradição fenomenològica de Edmund Husserl e no seu pensamento acerca da constituição intersubjectiva do mundo da vida. Nesse sentido, o autor propõe uma hermenêutica realista, e não relativista, posicionando-se em função de um projecto mais global de fundamentar na hermenêutica algumas das principais posições da Escola Austríaca de Economia, pelo que o artigo propõe significativas pistas para uma releitura não só da praxeologia de Ludwig von Mises e da ordem espontânea de que fala Friedrich von Hayek, mas também da noção de middle ground proposta por Israel Kirzner e, não menos, de toda a temática relacionada com a empresarialidade. Por outro lado, posicionando-se numa perspectiva de superação da dialéctica entre teoria e história, entre "a priori" e "a posteriori", o artigo representa também uma chamada de atenção para a importância que deveria ter o estudo do pensamento de Edmund Husserl no âmbito das Ciências Sociais. This article aims in the first place at demonstrating how Edmund Husserl's idea of the intersubjective constitution of the life-world represents an appropriate explanation of the principle of subjectivity inherent to the theorizing of the Austrian School of Economics. In order to do this, the author proposes a realistic and non-relativistic view of hermeneutics, whereby his goal is precisely to demonstrate how much the Austrian School of Economics is grounded in hermeneutics. In this sense, the article suggests a new reading of Ludwig von Mises's praxeology, of Friedrich von Hayek's theory of the spontaneous order and a reinterpretation of Israel Kirzner's middle ground position and the corresponding theory of alertness. Positioning itself beyond the discussion between theory and history, or the debate if the prevalence should belong to the "a priori" or to the "a posteriori", the article suggests that Hus~<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i40064266<br>
Date: 12 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Rapp Jennifer R.<br>
Abstract: The gaps, fissures, and lapses of attention in a life—what I call "ordinary oblivions"—are fertile fragilities that present a compelling source for ethics. Plato, not Aristotle, is the ancient philosopher specially poised to speak to this feature of human life. Drawing upon poet C. K. Williams's idea that forgetting is a "looking away" that makes possible "beginning again," I present a Platonic approach to ethics as an alternative to Aristotelian or virtue ethics. Plato's Phaedrus is a key source text for this alternate picture; from it I suggest how we might construe Iris Murdoch's "task of seeing" in terms of the engagement with written form. Poetry is a central locale for such engagement, and thus suggests a kind of ethical praxis that arises from the theoretical emphases of my examination of forgetting, the unmoored self, remade other-regard, and sacred sources.<br>

Author(s): Sturgeon Kevin<br>
Abstract: Clifford Geertz's influential definition of religions as providing their members with both an ethos and a worldview-in his terms, both a "model for" and "model of" reality-has of late become a neuralgic point of contention in religious studies. In particular some critics have seen his ideas of religious models of reality as biased, out-moded, or in other ways confused about the way that language refers (or does not refer) to the world. In this article, I consider two criticisms of Geertz's project and seek to show that, despite the partial value of the criticisms, the idea of religious models of reality continues to be a legitimate and fruitful approach to what religious communities are typically up to.<br>

Author(s): BRONNER GÉRALD<br>
Abstract: Internet suscite beaucoup d'espoirs et de craintes. Certains prétendent que cet outil sera favorable à l'émergence de sociétés de la connaissance à condition de réduire préalablement la fracture numérique et cognitive. Cet article prend prétexte de cette idée pour évaluer quels sont les réels rapports de force qui se jouent entre croyances et connaissances sur la toile. Il montre, d'une part, que l'amplification de la diffusion de l'information est favorable à l'expression du biais de confirmation qui est un des mécanismes fondamentaux de la pérennité des croyances. Il souligne, d'autre part, qu'Internet est un marché cognitif très sensible à la structuration de l'offre et donc à la motivation des offreurs, ce qui confère un avantage décisif à l'empire des croyances contre celui de la connaissance. Ce dernier point est mesuré dans cet article de façon quantitative sur des thèmes de croyances diverses. The Internet is the source of many hopes and fears. Some claim that this tool will help lead to the emergence of knowledge societies if digital and cognitive gaps can be reduced beforehand. This article takes that idea as a basis to then evaluate what are the real power relations played out between beliefs and knowledge on the web. It shows that the amplification of the dissemination of information is conducive to the expression of "confirmation bias" which is one of the mechanisms which permit beliefs to survive. It also stresses that Internet is a cognitive market which is very sensitive to structuring of supply and therefore the motivation of suppliers, which confers a decisive advantage to the "empire of beliefs". This last point is measured quantitatively in this paper on various topics of belief.<br>

Author(s): Renouard Cecile<br>
Abstract: This article explores the possible convergence between the capabilities approach and utilitarianism to specify CSR. It defends the idea that this key issue is related to the anthropological perspective that underpins both theories and demonstrates that a relational conception of individual freedoms and rights present in both traditions gives adequate criteria for CSR toward the company's stakeholders. I therefore defend "relational capability" as a means of providing a common paradigm, a shared vision of a core component of human development. This could further lead to a set of indicators aimed at assessing corporate social performance as the maximization of the relational capability of people impacted by the activities of companies. In particular, I suggest a way of evaluating the contribution of extractive companies to the communities close to their industrial sites in extremely poor areas, not from the viewpoint of material resources and growth, but from the viewpoint of the quality of the social environment and empowerment.<br>

Abstract: The author presents a concise and peculiar view on the studies and researches which have been developed in the last 30 years or so about the social dimension of time. The article underlies the persisting validity of the idea of time as a socio-cultural institution (Durkheim and his school) and as a social construction (Berger and Luckmann); it also hints at the concept of «temporal culture», which has been rarely employed in studies concerning social times. According to the author, the main transformation concerning social times today is represented by the consequences of globalization and related aspects, such as «agglutination» of experiences concerning communication through space-time. In the last paragraph the question of rhythm in general and particularly of social rhythms is discussed: the author argues that this concept, distinct from time, deserves much more attention than it has received until now by social scientists interested in the subject.<br>

Abstract: O objetivo deste artigo é apresentar os significados atribuídos pelos muçulmanos à matança do carneiro, que acontece todos os anos na Festa do Sacrifício (Eid Al-Adha), a segunda maior da religião islâmica. Para dar conta desses significados, lanço mão da teoria winnicottiana do não-eu, expressão esta também cunhada na forma de não não-eu por Richard Schechner para tratar da atuação do ator. O artigo explora a idéia de que o carneiro ocupa o lugar do fiel que se entrega a Deus, estabelecendo uma analogia entre o sacrifício do carneiro e o sacrifício daquele que é muçulmano. In this article I would like to explore the multiples senses that muslins attributes to the sacrificial goat at the Feast of Sacrifice, Eid Adhha, one of the most important celebrations of the Islamic calendar, second only to Ramadan. This sacrifice is here analyzed from the perspective of D.W. Winnicott's psychoanalytical theory, as a sort of transitional object, "not me" and "not not me", the latest also supported by Richard Schechner when focuses the actor's experience. The idea developed here is to demonstrate that the goat occupies the devotee's place and establish an analogy between the goat sacrifice and the sacrifice of the one that is a muslin.<br>

Abstract: Can one speak of Israelitism in the case of Poland? By asking this question, one runs into the classic difficulty of the universalisation of concepts and to what extent they can be transposed. As a specific method of individualistic integration, French Israelitism pre-supposes a particular organisation of citizenship and society, a dissociation of political and religious categories, as well as a specific articulation of the universal and the particular. This article shows that Israelitism as an idea and a theoretical model entered Judeo-Polish society in the 19th century. Nevertheless, the sociological and political context was radically different from the institutions and public space of the Third Republic and thus limits to the importation of the model were soon reached. All the while drawing its political references from western cultures, the troubled history of Eastern Europe was not structured by the same variables nor by the same historical ruptures. The same words (nation, State, religion) do not have the same meaning; the modes of national and political constructions, particularly between religion and politics, has very little in common with what made French Israelitism possible in the 19th century. In Poland, the paradigm of the Israelite was merely an impossible dream.<br>

Author(s): SANTOS LAURA<br>
Abstract: Enquadrar de um modo filosófico, educacional e político a questão do "Testamento Vital" (ou "Diretivas Antecipadas de Tratamento") pressupõe não haver dúvidas sobre o seu conteúdo. Por isso, este artigo pretende, numa primeira parte, e atendendo às dúvidas existentes em Portugal, explicitar de que falamos quando falamos de "Testamento Vital". Só então seräo abordadas temáticas mais complexas que nos alertam para o facto de o "Testamento Vital" não ser um mero instrumento de regulação de vontades em relação ao fim de vida, mas remeter para economías específicas de verdade, valor e poder que pressupõem respostas distintas a perguntas fundamentais que o ser humano faz sobre si próprio: a sua suposta "natureza", a liberdade ou não de determinar o seu destino, o significado da tolerãncia ou o que é fazer e respeitar o "bem" dos outros. Finalmente, um último ponto tratará de uma problemática muito específica dentro do questionamento geral em torno do "Testamento Vital", que é a da autonomia prospetiva, pois esse "Testamento" visa determinar agora o que pretendemos que nos façam no futuro em termos de cuidados de saúde, caso estejamos na altura incapazes de decidir. Este último ponto será elaborado com base em reflexōes de Ronald Dworkin. In order to frame in a philosophical, educational and political way the issue of the living wilb (or Advance Directives of Treatment) we should assume that there are no doubts about their meaning. As this is not the case in Portugal, the first part of this article will address this question. Only then will we be confronted with more complex subjects, in order to develop the idea that living wilh are not just a mere instrument that regulate end-of-life issues, but involve specific economies of truth, value and power that imply different answers to fundamental questions that human beings put to themselves: their supposed "nature", their freedom to determine or not their destiny, the meaning of tolerance or what it means to do and to respect~<br>

Abstract: Depois de apresentar a inseparável relação entre religião e cultura, com base numa abordagem hermenêutica da filosofia da religião, focaliza-se a questão no topos da relação entre religião e violência, com recurso às leitura de Girard, Ricœur e Marquard. Ao contrário do que muitas propostas defendem, considera-se o potencial do monoteísmo como superador de violência. Nesse contexto, o conceito cristão de Deus, baseado na originária articulação da identidade com a relação, é considerado como caminho religioso para a superação da violência - também no âmbito da relação inter-cultural. After presenting the inseparable relation between religion and culture from the perspective of a hermeneutics of the philosophy of religion, the article centres its attention on the relation between religion and violence, with special recourse made to Girard, Ricœur, and Marquard. Contrary to what has been often proposed, the essay advances the idea that monotheism has the potential of overcoming violence. In this context, the Christian concept of God, based on an original articulation of identity and relation, is conceived as the religious path to the overcoming of violence - also in the ambit of intercultural relation.<br>

Abstract: In an empirical study using five real-world creative teams from an advertising agency, participants were given a strategic brief for a new beverage product and asked to design the layout for a print ad. Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apoarent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios. Not coincidentally, as a tentative conclusion, this more flexible team produced the ad judged most successful by advertising professionals. This still-to-be-tested exploratory finding deserves further investigation in future research that embodies various methodological refinements.<br>

Abstract: In the context of globalization, cultural anthropology gained a new momentum by highlighting the self-conscious persistence of cultural differences. Against the background of an ever increasing intensity of societal and economic entanglements, the vital claim of cultural differences must be a reflexive process associated with the idea that one's own culture is creative and adaptive to innovations. Anthropologists have defined a set of tools in order to describe these processes of cultural changes. These tools have the names of hybridization, creolization and domestication, but, in particular also of cultural appropriation. Historically cultural appropriation was mainly relevant in contexts of unequal power relations. Appropriation thereby became a strategy of the powerless, who used appropriation in order to undermine the structures defined by the powerful. Cultural appropriation can also be practised through mimesis, and thereby negates the authority of powerful actors. Cultural appropriation requires moments of negotiations and does not aim at definitive results, but merely at the transgression of boundaries. Well defined fields of cultural appropriation within anthropology are media studies and consumption. Empirical approaches to a more detailed documentation of appropriation can be the following: (1) Naming, (2) Contextualization, (3) Incorporation and (4) material transformation.<br>

Author(s): CATALÃO HELENA B.<br>
Abstract: O artigo aborda o pensamento de Emmanuel Lévinas a partir de duas perspectivas distintas mas complementares: numa primeira fase, recorrendo ao romance de guerra de Erich M. Remarque intitulado A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), procuraremos, com a ajuda de Jacques Derrida e de René Girard, desconstruir o pensamento de Lévinas, sustentando a ideia de que o "Humanismo do Outro Homem" contém vestígios de violência dissimulados percebíveis, quer a partir da interpretação levinasiana do referido romance, quer no modo como Lévinas resolve o problema da legítima defesa; numa segunda fase, demonstraremos que a restauração do pensamento de Lévinas passa, por um lado, pela noção de "filialidade" (e não a de "Rosto" ou a de "substituição"), a pedra basilar não corrosiva do pensamento de Lévinas e, por outro lado, pela ideia de que a "desfiguração" da fenomenologia e da ontologia, operada pelo autor, é aparente uma vez que estas não obstruam a alteridade mas antes a tornam possível. The article deals with the thought of Emmanuel Levinas using two distinct but complementary perspectives: in a first phase, using the war novel by Erich M. Remarque entitled A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), we will try, with the help of Jacques Derrida and René Girard, deconstruct the thought of Levinas, supporting the idea that the "Humanism of the Other Man" contains traces of perceivable covert violence, either from the Levinasian interpretation of the Novel, or in the way that Levinas solves the problem of self-defense; in a second phase, we will demonstrate that restoration of Levinas's thought is, on one hand, the notion of "filiality" (and not 'Face' or 'exchange'), the cornerstone non--corrosive of Levinas's thought, on the other hand, by using the idea of 'defacement' of phenomenology and ontology, used by the author, is apparent since they do not obstruct the alterity but rather becomes it possible.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i217647<br>
Date: 8 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Wagar Helena<br>
Abstract: The article presents the notion of peace research, as exemplified by Johan Galtung, as a cognitive movement from the ideational to the anthropo-centric conception. In its anthropo-centric conception, the notion displays a variation in which the progress of man is outlined as a telic process of the mind (as opposed to the genetic process of nature); a process whereby man is able to make choices and direct his own development. In the post-World War II decades, the anthropo-centric concern for progress through mind is actualized as a problem of formation of mental attitude. It is further anticipated that in peace research this movement, in the sense of the cognitive process of research (not in focus here), outlines an idea of the mind-in-progress which is an idea of the moral man. Finally, the author points out an alternative direction to the anthropo-centric critique of the ideational conception in terms of which, according to the thesis of the article, the cognitive movement of peace research largely makes itself understood.<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can. Because fragmentary works often represent a work in a nascent state or in a state of tr~<br>

Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: La coexistence de différentes manières de penser l'historicité - qu'elles soient, en particulier, cycliques ou linéaires - est évidente dans l'histoire longue de la Chine et, plus généralement, de l'Asie orientale. C'est ce que démontre l'article de Prasenjit Duara qui, après une réflexion sur les débats historiques et philosophiques portant sur le temps et l'histoire, insiste sur la manière dont les circulations transnationales affectent profondément les formes de l'historicité. Ici, c'est le rapport entre nation et conscience historique qui est examiné à nouveaux frais. Les récits du passé sont peut-être nécessaires à toutes les organisations sociales qui cherchent à se constituer comme telles. Cependant, avant l'apparition de l'Étatnation, ces récits non seulement englobaient des différences et des contestations, mais ils entretenaient aussi une relation à un temps et des idéaux universels ou cosmologiques. L'émergence de la modernité contribua au désenchantement du politique, parallèlement à l'avènement d'États capitalistes en concurrence, qui cherchèrent a mobiliser toutes les formes de ressources et de biopouvoir. Ces histoires de l'État et de la civilisation, linéaires et réifiées, furent essentielles dans cette mobilisation. Un bon exemple peut en être donné avec les récits historiques eurasiens et la manière dont ils circulèrent. Cet article les examine et s'intéresse notamment aux modalités de l'historicité en Asie orientale, en étant attentif à leurs circulations et en insistent sur les voies, à la fois globales et régionales, qu'elles empruntèrent. Leurs forces furent converties en récits historiques linéaires de nations souveraines engagées dans des interrelations de compétitions agressives. Narratives of the past are perhaps necessary in all collectivities that seek to constitute themselves as such. Before the modern nation-state, however, these narratives not only embedded differences and contestations, they also bore a relationship to universal or co~<br>

Abstract: In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermas's account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Elliet Guillaume<br>
Abstract: Depuis plusieurs années, les mots « morale » , « éthique » , « déontologie » ont fait leur apparition dans la sphère financière. Consciente des exigences éthiques de leur métier, de nombreuses institutions financières ont créé en leur sein des équipes de déontologues chargées de définir et de contrôler les comportements des professionnels. Un nouvel ordre normatif est né, composé non seulement des codes de conduite, mais aussi des travaux des autorités de contrôle et même du législateur. L'hétérogénéité de ces textes et l'utilisation désormais systématique du concept de déontologie par les acteurs de la place sèment une certaine confusion dans l'esprit du juriste, incapable aujourd'hui de définir juridiquement cette notion. Cet article a pour ambition de faire le point sur cette situation et de proposer des pistes de réflexion. For many years now, the words « moral », « ethics » , « deontology » have made an appearance on the financial scene. Being aware of the ethical requirements of their activity, many financial institutions have set up an inhouse team of deontologists in charge of defining and controlling professional behaviour. New standards have been applied, which are not only composed of codes of behaviour, but also of work done by regulators and even legislators. These heterogeneous texts and the systematic use of the deontology concept by market participants have brought about some confusion in jurist's minds, which until today have been unable to legally define this idea. This article aims at presenting this situation and proposing some areas of reflection.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell-Wiley Publishing<br>
Issue: i40115211<br>
Date: 1 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Ricoeur Paul<br>
Abstract: Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrationality of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions — the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another — judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions — celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement — solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, l'idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen — nämlich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen —, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwischen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterscheidet. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergeb~<br>

Author(s): Christoff Daniel<br>
Abstract: La signe comme expression (Husserl) consiste selon F. de Saussure dans le rapport immotivé signifíant-signifíé, sa valeur signifiante étant déterminée par la place du signifiant dans le système réel de la langue tandis que le signifié-concept (de Saussure) est noème, irréel (Husserl). Inerte tant qu'aucun acte d'expression ou de compréhension ne l'anime (ré-anime), il porte, exprime et induit l'intentionnalité de ces actes; il est conscience hors de soi, intentionnalité sans sujet, visée du signifié différenciée par son signifiant (objet d'une science de faits, la linguistique). Aussi les problèmes du «sujet», de l' «origine», de la «suffisance» du signe adéquat, de l'«insuffisance» du signe qui, en son ouverture, exprime au-delà de lui-même, exigent-ils l'élucidation du champ de signification, notamment des figures métonymiques ou métaphoriques qui y apparaissent. According to F. de Saussure a sign or an expression (Husserl) is constituted by the unmotivated relation between the signifier and the signified, the value of the signifier is determined by the position it occupies in the real system of language, while the signified concept (de Saussure) is a noema, i.e. unreal (Husserl). Inactive, as long as there is no act of expression or understanding to (re) activate it, the concept carries the intentionality of these acts, conveys it and leads us to it. It constitutes a consciousness outside of the self, an intentionality without a subject, a target of the signified, as differentiated by the signifier (the object of a science, the linguistics). In this sense the solution to the problems concerning the «subject», the «origin», the «sufficiency» of an adequate sign, the «insufficiency» of a sign, when it signifies things other than itself, requires the clarification of the idea of a field of meaning, especially the meaning of occurring metonymies and metaphors.

Abstract: En suivant le mouvement circulaire que dessine l'ouvrage fondamental d'Éric Weil, la « Logique de la Philosophie », on relève d'un même coup le penser qui s'y déploie et le rôle qu'y tiennent l'idée de Dieu, la foi biblique et le christianisme. On analyse d'abord la catégorie de Dieu, introduite dans le monde par l'attitude de la foi biblique. On note ensuite ce que devient l'idée de Dieu dans les catégories ultérieures. L'examen des catégories du sens et de la sagesse, constitutives de la philosophie, permet de voir comment le logicien recueille à sa manière le sur-être indicible de la tradition philosophique occidentale, sous la forme du sens présent, de l'éternité de la présence dans le temps de l'histoire. On manifeste enfin, à travers l'écart, quelques convergences entre cette philosophie séculière et la pensée d'un croyant. In the circular movement of the main work of Eric Weil, the « Logique de la Philosophie », we may notice both the development of the thought and the part played by the idea of God, the biblical faith and Christianity. The category of God, introduced by the behaviour of biblical faith, is analysed, and also how the idea of God appears in further categories. By examining categories of meaning and wisdom, proper to philosophy, we may see what means, for the logician, the ineffable over-being of the Western philosophical tradition, as a present meaning, as an eternal presence in historical time. At last appears, through the difference, some convergence between this secular philosophy and the thought of a believer.<br>

Author(s): KIRSCHER Gilbert<br>
Abstract: A l'opposé des discours philosophiques contemporains, la Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) d'Éric Weil reprend pour l'essentiel l'idée kantienne de la loi morale. Mais elle déplace la problématique de la fondation en procédant selon la méthode de l'« analyse génétique » qui concilie « développement phénoménologique » et « exposé encyclopédique ». Le chemin des apories de la réflexion morale conduit à la conscience de soi philosophique de la question morale comme question, et comme question irréductible, c'est-à-dire comme question que se pose une liberté qui a déjà, sans raison, choisi la raison. Contrary to the contemporary philosophical discourses, E. Weil's Philosophie Morale (Paris, 1961) resumes in his essential part the kantian idea of the moral law. But E. Weil displaces the problem of foundation, proceeding by the method of « genetical analysis » which conciliates « phenomenological development » and « encyclopaedic exposition » . The way of the apories of the moral reflexion leads into the philosophical self-consciousness of the moral question as a question, and as an irreducible question, in other words as a question stated to a freedom which has, without reason, already chosen the reason.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: Le projet métaphorologique de Hans Blumenberg correspond - répond et s'oppose, comme « la Mythologie blanche » de Jacques Derrida - à l'idée heideggérienne de « de l'être ». Le concept de « l'inconceptuabilitè » révise cette critique historiquement limitée du logocentrisme, en réduisant le concept d'Etre de Heidegger ad absurdum. Hans Blumenberg's project of a metaphorology corresponds — answers and contrediets, as Jacques Derrida's « Mythologie blanche » does - to the heideggerian idea of « history of being ». The device of « unconceptuability » reformulates this critics of logocentrism, historically limited, by reducing ad absurdum Heidegger's concept of being.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: Cet article offre une vision globale de l'œuvre de Ricœur, l'auteur proposant d'y lire une logique de développement en spirale, parce que dans les ouvrages les plus tardifs du philosophe nous trouvons un retour de la recherche sur la volonté — inscrite dans le cadre d'une anthropologie philosophique — qui avait inspiré son projet de jeunesse. Mouvement en spirale, et non retour circulaire aux origines, car entre le début et la fin il n'y a pas coïncidence mais enrichissement après un long détour à travers l'univers du langage. Ce détour — selon l'hypothèse de travail de l'auteur — progresse à travers trois paradigmes: symbole, texte et traduction. Dans la traduction travaillent le propre et l'étranger, le soi et l'autre, l'autre que nous retrouvons en nous et qui ne se réduit pas à l'altérité de l'autre homme. Un concept pluriel d'humanité — qui est pourtant une — y est à l'oeuvre. Le travail jamais accompli de la traduction suggère enfin l'idée d'une herméneutique de l'inachèvement. This article offers a global vision of Ricœur's work, in which the author suggests the existence of a spiral development, insofar as in the most recent works we find a return to the same research on the will — within the context of a philosophical anthropology — that inspired the project of Ricœur's youthful years. Spiral movement and not circular return to the origin, because the beginning and the end do not coincide but rather enrich one another, after a long detour of many decades through the universe of language. This detour — according to author's working hypothesis — has progressively developed through three paradigms: symbol, text and translation. In translation, what is at work is the familiar and the foreign, the self and the other, the other that we find in ourselves and that cannot be reduced to the otherness of the other man. In translation we find a plural concept of humanity, which is nevertheless one. The never complete work of translation suggests ultimately the idea of ~<br>

Abstract: The explication of contextualisation in terms of metaphor theory facilitates the utilisation of procedures of literary analysis, the idea of the model reader of a text, as well as the social analysis of discourses for the explication of the contextualisation of a text. The explication of the interaction between text and reader, or contextualiser in terms of metaphor theory explains some of the complexities involved in reading or contextualising texts. In the metaphoric interaction between text and reader the activity of contextualisation functions as a contextual or situational filter which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the discourse of the reader, implying statements about it that normally apply to the text. As a text in counter-determining context, the text is retroactively determined by the discourse which selects, emphasises, suppresses and organises features of the text, implying statements about it that normally apply to the discourse or context.<br>

Abstract: Les conceptions épistémologiques de Rousseau affectent ses perceptions et son discours sur la politique. L'accord de Rousseau avec la critique moderne des idées innées et son désaccord avec le monisme matérialiste dans la psychologie empirique ne rendent pas seulement compte de la manière (ou méthode) par laquelle Rousseau perçoit la politique, mais aussi du remplacement de l'idée classique de la raison pratique par les principes formels d'égalité et de liberté comme principes du jugement politique. La reconnaissance par Rousseau des limites du formalisme, comme étant le motif d'une pratique individuelle, explique son emploi d'artifices à la fois rhétoriques et poétiques, servant à donner une substance dynamique aux « formes » que son enseignement préconise. Sa vision politique devient ainsi une synthèse ingénieuse du formalisme mathématique et de l'aisthesis poétique. Rousseau's epistemological conceptions affect his perceptions and discourse on politics. Rousseau's agreement with the modern criticism of inate ideas and his disagreement with materialist monism in empirical psychology do not only account for the manner (or method) in which Rousseau perceives of politics, but also the replacement of the classical idea of practical reason by formal principles of equality and liberty as principles of political judgement. Rousseau's recognition of the limits of formalism as the grounds for individual practice explains his use of both rhetorical and poetic devices which give dynamic substance to the " forms " envisaged by his teaching. His political vision thus becomes an ingenious synthesis of mathematical formalism and poetical aisthesis.<br>

Abstract: L'approche des choix rationnels, sans être spécifique ni inédite dans l'aire latino-américaine, est aujourd'hui de plus en plus utilisée par les politistes. Cette stratégie de recherche s'inscrit dans le cadre d'un changement de paradigme, où les approches macro-orientées et focalisées sur les conditions objectives font place aux approches pluralistes, valorisant davantage les variables politiques et accordant une place centrale aux individus-acteurs. A partir de l'hypothèse de la rationalité imparfaite, ces recherches ont souligné le problème de l'incertitude inhérent aux démocratisations. Elles ont surtout développé l'idée, tout en se démarquant des analyses volontaristes, que les acteurs pouvaient tirer des avantages de cette incertitude, ouvrant ainsi la voie à des approches davantage probabilistes que déterministes. The rational choice approach, while neither specific nor totally new in the Latin American field, is increasingly used by political scientists. This research strategy is part of a paradigmatic change in which macro-oriented approaches, focused on objective conditions, are replaced by pluralist approaches, which emphasize political variables and stress individual actors. Based on the assumption of imperfect rationality, rational choice research has underlined the problem of the uncertainty inherent to democratizations. While keeping at a distance from voluntaristic analyses, it has above all developed the idea that the actors could take advantage of the uncertainty, thus opening the way to approaches more probabilistic than deterministic.<br>

Abstract: Cet article présente l'approche interprétative de la gouvernance, une approche inspirée par la philosophie herméneutique, qui met l'accent sur l'intentionnalité, l'historicité et la réflexivité et qui propose de repenser la gouvernance. Cette approche a été développée pour répondre aux défis posés par les théories du choix rationnel et leurs remises en cause des premières études sur la gouvernance qui, pour comprendre les réformes néolibérales, s'appuyaient sur un positivisme tempéré et sur la littérature des réseaux de politiques publiques. En considérant la gouvernance comme le produit d'un travail de mise en sens et en s'appuyant sur une conception non essentialiste de l'État, cette approche répond ainsi à l'idée de méta-gouvernance défendue par les tenants du choix rationnel. Cet article présente cette approche en insistant sur l'intentionnalité et l'historicité, en l'illustrant par des exemples d'histoires de gouvernance, et en proposant en conclusion les implications d'une telle approche pour l'analyse des politiques publiques. La théorie interprétative encourage une approche plus éclectique des données, suggère la méfiance vis-à-vis de tout modèle ou cadre formel, et accorde un rôle renforcé donné au storytelling. This article discusses the interpretive approach to governance. The interpretive approach comes from a hermeneutic philosophy, emphasizing intentionality, historicism, and reflexivity. These philosophical ideas décentre governance. The first wave of governance studies relied on a lukewarm positivism, extending the literature on policy networks to cover neoliberal reforms. This account of governance faced challenges from rational choice theory and from the idea of metagovernance. The interpretive approach responds to these challenges. The interpretive approach to governance responds to rational choice by decentring governance; patterns of governance arise as the products of meaning in action. The interpretive approach responds to metagovernance by de~<br>

Abstract: Este artigo procura alcançar uma reflexão conceptual na qual, a Filosofia Hermenêutica pode ser instituída como fundamento da Filosofía do Direito e do fenómeno jurídico e, consequentemente, como uma base para futuros desenvolvimentos da actual Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito, de forma a poder ser alternativa ao Direito Natural e ao Positivismo Legal. Por conseguinte, um conceito chave a ser abordado é o de "ser com", visto que a situação do Mundo promove o surgimento do Direito no seu encontro com outro "ser com". Assim, a relação jurídica ficaria sustentada pela hermenêutica, a partir do conceito central de significado, enquanto profundidade e plenitude do ser jurídico, no qual a sua possibilidade de valorização é estabelecida como sentido de justiça. Assim, a Filosofia Hermenêutica do Direito providenciaria um retorno à ética, à luz do que juridicamente lhe diz respeito, de significados abertos à renovação, permitindo uma maneira de mudar a ideia estática de Filosofia do Direito, porque a justificação não assenta nos conteúdos morais, mas no sentido do ser. This article seeks to achieve a conceptual reflection in which Hermeneutical Philosophy can be established as a foundation for Philosophy of Law and the legal phenomenon, and, thus, as a ground for future developments in the current Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law that can be alternative to Natural Law and Legal Positivism, giving answers to common problems. Consequently, a key concept to be addressed in this article is "be with", since the situation in the world fosters the emergence of Law in its encounter with another "be with". Thus, the legal relationship would be sustained by hermeneutics, from the central concept of meaning as deepness and fullness of juridical being, in which m the possibility of its valuation is established as a sense of justice. So, the Hermeneutics Philosophy of Law would provide a return to ethics, in view of what juridically concerns it, with meanings opened to renovation, allowi~<br>

Abstract: The term intellectuals(s) has been in use for scarcely more than one century. What is its definition? What conditions of possibility govern the emergence of the Modern intellectual? How many of these conditions can be traced to the past? The typological approach used here sets the origin of the intellectual's role and status in the new paradigm of power established in Carolingian times (781-804), which displayed a peculiar axiom: the idea that all Power is intrinsically divisible. This view was already five centuriesold when Petrarch claimed the autonomous position of cultural critic—not the Modern intellectual's status, but some of his authority, though on different grounds.<br>

Publisher: Universitätsverlag WINTER GmbH<br>
Issue: i40138215<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Voelz Johannes<br>
Abstract: Combining a historical with a theoretical perspective, this essay begins by reconstructing Ralph Waldo Emerson's evolving theory of recognition and the central role it played for his concept of 'self-reliance.' Initially having adopted the theorizations of recognition developed by Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, Emerson came to articulate the idea of self-reliance by way of developing an alternative approach to recognition, in which the source allocating recognition is neither society nor an inborn moral sense, but rather the transcendentally conceptualized self. Emerson's shift towards self-recognition poses questions seldom asked in the contemporary debate on recognition. Moving beyond a reconstructive aim, one such question is considered in the article's second part: What role does recognition come to play in the act of reading? Taking Emerson's own essays as a case in point, the author argues that the aesthetic experience afforded by non-fictional texts can be understood as a facilitator of self-recognition—as a continuous process of imaginarily experiencing the enlargement of the self. This process intersects with dynamics of social recognition, producing a 'dual economy of recognition.' The article concludes by challenging the assumption found in currently dominant paradigms of recognition which assumes that recognition can come to successful completion. Conceived as a dual economy, the article argues, recognition is to the contrary constitutively open-ended.<br>

Abstract: Fondé en 1945, Réforme offre un réel pluralisme politique et il se présente plutôt comme le journal où les intellectuels protestants sont en mesure de s'exprimer. En face de la Guerre d'Algérie, il possède une ligne politique générale que l'on appelle alors « libérale », c'est-à-dire favorable à une évolution progressive, qui n'écarte pas l'idée, à long terme, d'une indépendance de l'Algérie où les Français pourraient continuer à vivre. À partir de 1958, son directeur, A. Finet, fait confiance au général de Gaulle pour résoudre le problème ; mais une partie de ses rédacteurs sont nettement plus à gauche, sans négliger, pour autant, la détresse des Français d'Algérie. The review Réforme, founded in 1945, offers a genuine variety of political views, and sees itself as the forum where Protestant intellectuals can express themselves. Confronted with the Algerian War, it adopted a general political stance then known as "liberal", that is to say, in favour of gradual evolution which would not exclude, in the long term, the idea of independence for an Algeria in which the French could continue to live. From 1958 on its director, A. Finet, put his faith in General de Gaulle as the person to solve the problem ; but some of his editorial colleagues were distinctly more left-wing, without however ignoring the distress of the Algerian French. Die 1945 gegründete Wochenzeitung Réforme (Reformation) bietet politisch einen wirklichen Pluralismus und bietet den protestantischen Intellektuellen die Möglichkeit, ihre Meinung zu äußern. Zum Algerienkrieg hat « Réforme » eine allgemeine politische Linie, die man damah « liberal » nannte, nämlich dass eine langsame Entwicklung angestrebt wurde, die auch die Unabhängigkeit Algeriens, in dem die Franzosen weiterhin leben könnten, nicht ausschloss. Der Direktor von « Réforme » , A. Finet, vertraut ab 1958 General de Gaulle, dass er eine Lösung finden könnte, während einige Redakteure des Blatts eine deutlich linke Position einnehmen, ohne ~<br>

Abstract: The idea/metaphor of the world as a text, essential to the so called linguistic turn of human and social sciences, has a long intellectual history which originates, from the very beginning of Christianity, in Saint Paul's assertion of the presence of a double sense (literal and spiritual) in the Old Testament. Starting from this point, the present paper sets out to describe the development and consolidation of the tradition of Biblical exegesis and hermeneutics which in the 20th century gave rise to a variety of schools and trends that in one way or another maintain the fundamental thesis that reality is a text that is to be deciphered. The article also highlights that the original Christian sources did generate two other lines of intellectual tradition: a more temperate exegetical tradition prevailing in the Catholic world, and furthermore the current Western cultural belief that world is like a book (a belief which kept the terms of the comparison separated and did not confuse them).<br>

Abstract: Au terme de recherches concernant l'inclusion ou l'exclusion de tel ou tel livre dans le canon biblique, les circonstances culturelles et politiques, doctrinales et ecclésiastiques entourant la définition du corpus biblique sont de mieux en mieux connues : le risque aujourd'hui est de réduire la clôture canonique à une décision juridique ou disciplinaire extérieure au contenu du Livre. 1 – En s'appuyant sur les études contemporaines de la naissance de la parole sur Jésus, on essaie ici de décrire l'éclosion et le développement de la dynamique canonique chrétienne à partir de l'idée juive de canon et de la pratique juive de l'« accomplissement des Écritures ». 2 – On décrit ensuite plusieurs procédés poétiques qui en résultent et qui font de la Bible canonisée un livre profondément unifié. 3 – On suggère enfin que les pratiques ecclésiastiques de la parole peuvent se comprendre comme la réception requise par cette poétique. After so many studies concerning the inclusion or exclusion of any given book in the biblical canon have been written, the cultural, political, doctrinal, and ecclesiastic circumstances surrounding the definition of the biblical corpus are more and more known. The risk today is to reduce the closure of the canon to a juridical or disciplinary decision exterior to the content of the Book. 1.) Employing contemporary studies of the beginnings of the word about Jesus, I try here to describe the formation and development of the Christian canonical dynamics. starting from the Jewish idea of the canon and the Jewish practice of "the fulfillment of the Scriptures". 2.) I then describe some poetic devices that result from this and which make the canonized Bible a profoundly unified book. 3.) I suggest finally that the ecclesiastical usage of the Word can be understood as the reception required by this poetics.<br>

Abstract: Sacred music has always been a source of controversy throughout history since it is an integral part of the liturgy. Contemporary Christian music (CCM) has reached a pinnacle of controversy as its realm of consumption expands globally and inter-denominationally. This study was inspired by the idea of Ricoeur's phenomenology of religion to examine the contemporary practice of liturgy and sacred music. This brings into discussion the historical controversy and cultural milieu of adopting popular culture into youth ministry. Korean case is important because Korea represents one of the strongest Christian populations in the world and at the same time challenges - a drop in the number of young members and a huge generational gap in its church congregations. In order to scrutinize the concrete process of youth culture in the Christian community, an empirical study of youth ministry in seven mega churches in Seoul in South Korean was conducted as a case study. Sakralna glazba oduvijek je tijekom povijesti bila izvor kontroverzi jer predstavlja integrálni dio liturgije, a povijest glazbe je iz nje izrasla. Suvremena kršèanska glazba dostigla je vrhunac kontroverzije kad se njezino potrošaèko podruèje proširilo globalno i medukonfesionalno. Ovaj je članak nastao na temelju Ricoeurove fenomenologije religije i nastoji ispitati suvremenu praksu u liturgiji i sakralnoj glazbi u svjetlu nasljeda povijesne kontroverze i kultúrne sredine u prihvaćanju populárne kultúre u mladenačkoj službi božjoj. Teologija glazbe, o kojoj su raspravljali u 16. stoljeèu Luther, Zwingli i Calvin, osobito je korisna za konzultiranje pri suvremenom prilagodavanju na populárnu kulturu u crkvi. Štoviše, humanizam usaden u liturgijsku reformaciju u razdoblju renesanse otvára filozofijsko pitanje čovjekova identiteta pred licem božanskoga, o èemu se raspravljalo tijekom moderne i postmoderne povijesti sve do danas. Kako bi se pažljivo ispitao konkrétni proces mladenačke kulture u kršćanskoj zajednici, pr~<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>

Date: 4 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): DeLoughrey Elizabeth M.<br>
Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: Este documento aborda la forma en que se puede comprender la identidad de mujeres de unidades territoriales distintas a partir de la forma en que usan y perciben el tiempo. Se trata de mujeres que viven en unidades territoriales vecinas, pero a su vez muy disimiles: pueblos conurbados, colonias populares y colonias residenciales. A lo largo del trabajo se presenta el marco teórico-metodológico que se utilizò para aproximarse al aspecto temporal. Se hace hincapié en la necesidad de tener un acercamiento desde una perspectiva de gènero, ya que la forma en que se utiliza el tiempo está fuertemente vinculada a la idea que se tiene de ser hombre de ser mujer. Asimismo, los aspectos generacional y de clase influyen sobre la manera en que el tiempo es utilizado. This paper approaches the way to understand women's identities from diverse territorial units departing from the way they use and perceive time. We focus on women living in neighboring territorial units, but with many dissimilarities: towns absorbed by the city, popular neighborhoods and middle-class neighborhoods. The article describes the theoretical-methodological frame used to approach time and the temporal dimension. A gender perspective is emphasized, since time use patterns that are strongly linked to the idea of being a man or a woman. In addition, markers of generational and social class also have an influence on how time is used.<br>

Abstract: L'idée qu'on se fait généralement, en philosophie de l'action, de la structure physique de l'agir, n'est-elle pas trop schématique? Si l'intentionnalité semble un élément incontournable de la définition de l'agir, n'est-ce pas parce qu'on n'attribue qu'un sens anémique à la notion de mouvement corporel? Il se peut que cette notion, analysée de façon adéquate, se révèle assez vigoureuse pour fonder à elle seule la notion d'agir. Is it not the case that in the philosophy of action we generally have a highly simplified idea of the physical structure of action? Does not defining action in terms of an intention seem unavoidable simply because we give such an anemic meaning to the notion of bodily movement? But if this notion were adequately analyzed, it would perhaps prove sufficient as a basis for the concept of action.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur voit dans la Règle d'Or l'expression la plus achevée de la norme morale, en ce qu'elle exprime l'idée même de réciprocité. Mais telle qu'elle est formulée, il est douteux qu'elle puisse rendre justice de l'altérité véritable. Les présupposés phénoménologiques qui président à son établissement sont tels qu'elle produit un «effet-radar»: autrui est une réverbération de moi. C'est pourquoi une autre formulation en sera proposée. Paul Ricœur sees in the Golden Rule the most perfected expression of the moral norm in that it communicates the very idea of reciprocity. But such as it is formulated, it can doubtfully do justice to genuine alterity. The phenomenological presuppositions for laying it down are such that it produces a "radar effect" : the other is a reverberation of oneself. This is a why another formulation is proposed.<br>

Abstract: En travaillant sur quelques reprises littéraires des récits de la Passion du Christ, l'article tente de montrer comment la relecture littéraire permet de redécouvrir la manière dont les textes bibliques interpellent leurs lectrices et lecteurs. En particulier, il s'attache à faire apparaître comment certains personnages de ces récits, par la transposition littéraire, deviennent des offres fictives d'identité narrative. Pour ce faire, l'auteur se laisse guider par la théorie de la narrativité de Paul Ricoeur et la conception de l'acte de lecture de Wolfgang her. Using literary renditions of the Passion narratives, this article tries to show how literary rereadings allow us to discover the way biblical texts interpellate the reader. In particular, it seeks to bring out the way certain characters, in the literary transposition of these stories, become fictive overtures of narrative identity. The author is inspired by Paul Ricoeur's theory of narrativity and Wolfgang Iser's idea of the act of reading.<br>

Abstract: Nous montrons ici que le rejet de l'identité par Wittgenstein s'appuie sur la contestation du principe de causalité, doublé d'une conception pragmatique de la personne. Dans son rejet de la causalité la position de Wittgenstein ressemble fortement à celle de David Hume. Pour parvenir à une conception pragmatique de la personne on analysera l'usage linguistique et grammatical qui régit l'identité personnelle. Chez Wittgenstein le concept de personne se définit par rapport au contexte actionnel. Here we show that Wittgentstein's dismissal of identity is dependent on the disputing of the principle of causality, reinforced by a pragmatic concept of personhood. In his rejection of causality, the position of Wittgenstein resembles that of David Hume. In order to get to a pragmatic idea of personhood, linguistic and grammatical usage of the terms defining personal identity is analysed. For Wittgenstein, the idea of personhood is defined in relation to the actual context.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur analyse l'ouvrage de J.-B. Schneewind récemment traduit en français. Après en avoir présenté les lignes principales, il lui adresse trois questions découlant de la perspective historique adoptée dans le livre : Qu'en est-il de l'historicité de la philosophie morale ? Comment tenir compte de la conflictualité des théories morales entre elles ? Quelle place faut-il accorder à l'idée de Dieu ou d'une forme de transcendance dans l'éthique contemporaine ? The author analyses the recently translated work by Schneewind into French. After a brief, overall presentation, he puts forth three questions which result from the historical perspectives Schneewind takes in his book: – what of the historicity of moral philosophy? – how can we take account of the conflicts between moral theories? – what place must be given to the idea of God or to a form of transcendence in contemporary ethics?<br>

Abstract: L'auteur interroge la thèse de Joseph Weiler, juriste juif américain, spécialiste de droit européen, en faveur de l'idée d'une Europe chrétienne et la met en corrélation avec la théorie éthique de Robert Spaemann, philosophe de conviction catholique, au sujet de la catégorie de personne. Il en résulte des questions critiques, dans le sens d'une éthique de la reconnaissance et de la reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) et d'une plus grande valorisation du théologique comme tel au sein de l'espace public. The author looks at the thesis of Joseph Weiler, a Jewish American jurist specializing in European law and favouring the idea of a Christian Europe, and juxtaposes it to the ethics theory of Robert Spaemann, a Catholic philosopher, with regards to the category of personhood. There result some critical questions in the direction of an ethics of recognition and reconstruction (Jean-Marc Ferry) and of greater value given to the theological as such in the public sphere.<br>

Abstract: Reprenant la célèbre distinction de Max Weber entre éthique de conviction (Gesinnnungsethik, littéralement éthique de l'intention ou de la motivation) et éthique de responsabilité (Verantwortungsethik), l'auteur, qui a exercé la charge de Conseiller fédéral à Berne, s'interroge sur ce qui pourrait différencier l'éthique du politicien de l'éthique du citoyen. Après avoir montré, à la suite de Paul Ricoeur, que l'une et l'autre sont confrontées à des questions semblables, même si elles se situent à des niveaux différents, l'article développe le sens large de la responsabilité comme parole, réponse et engagement responsable. Using Max Weber's famous distinction between an ethics of conviction (Gesinnungsethik, literally an ethics of intention or motivation) and an ethics of responsibility (Verantwortungsethik), the author, ex-Federal Councillor in Bern, reflects upon the possible differences between the ethics of the politician and that of the citizen. After showing that, following Paul Ricoeur, both are confronted with similar questions, though situated at different levels, this article develops the larger idea of responsibility as one's word, response and responsible commitment.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricœur construit la philosophie comme une hétérotopie, en la soumettant à l'ordre, juridique et théologique, d'un «aveu». En soustrayant la pensée à la compétence première de la philosophie pour l'accorder à l'ordre d'un récit, Ricoeur fait de l'exercice de la philosophie une «empirique de la volonté serve». Ce primat donné à un ordre de médiation, par le biais d'un récit, dépouille ainsi la philosophie de toute tâche inaugurale. Dans ses Valences of the Dialectic, le philosophe américain Jameson est revenu de façon critique sur ce montage, soulignant le paradoxe qui oblige Ricœur à ôter la pensée du temps des tâches premières de la phénoménologie. Cet article vise à en exposer les conséquences (notamment le basculement vers une herméneutique), pour interroger les effets théologico-politiques de ce vaste projet. Paul Ricoeur constructs philosophy as a heterotopia, in subjecting it in the order of a juridical and theological «confession». By subtracting thought from the primordial competency of philosophy in order to link it to a story, Ricoeur displays the primacy of a third party. In his Valences of the Dialectic, the American philosopher Jameson has reviewed this assemblage, underlining the paradox which thus obliges Ricoeur to pull out an idea from the time of the first tasks of phenomenology. This article tries to lay out the consequences (notably the swinging towards hermeneutics), so as to question the theological-political effects of this vast project.<br>

Author(s): Brown Gavin<br>
Abstract: This paper, theoretical in nature, discusses how the study of ritual has been re-conceptualized in terms of performance theory. This involves firstly defining the difficult term 'performance' and then proceeding to explore how ritual can be recast as a (cultural) performance. Building on this discussion, it is argued that recasting ritual as performance has led the scholar of ritual to pay closer attention to how indeterminacy inheres within all ritual performances. This is explored in two senses. Firstly, by 'privileging the moment' in ritual analysis, the essentially indeterminate nature of meaning in ritual performances becomes evident. Secondly, working with Victor Turner's idea of ritual anti-structure and cultural reflexivity, I explore how rituals are constituted by cultural indeterminacy, a condition most discernible in the execution of ritual action, that is, in performance.<br>

Abstract: De François Wahl à Jürgen Habermas, la critique de la cratologie de Foucault a beaucoup évolué. Mais si Foucault n'apparaît plus comme un phénoménologue honteux de la volonté de puissance, trahissant ses prétentions structuralistes, il reste quand même un penseur ambigu qui, à la manière de Heidegger, élabore un discours « empirico - existentiel » à l'aide de catégories « historico-transcendantales ». Pourtant, si la critique habermassienne a le mérite d'attirer l'attention sur un trait central de la modernité que Foucault laisse de côté — la « solidification » des structures collectives —, elle ne nous offre pas, comme la critique de Foucault, les moyens de résister au processus d'intégration et de cristallisation des structures modernes, mais semble plutôt entériner la suprématie du savoir moderne de la contrainte par les structures institutionnelles. Pour notre part, nous pensons qu'une philosophie politique doit répondre, à notre époque, au problème relevé par Habermas avec les méthodes de contestation employées par Foucault. Cette philosophie politique devra même tenir compte, en tant que reflet de la situation actuelle, de l'ignorance de Foucault quant au problème crucial de la logique institutionnelle moderne et du refus par Habermas de toute critique qui vise à produire un conflit avec la logique dominante d'intégration. From François Wahl to Jürgen Habermas, criticisms of Foucault's theory of power have evolved considerably. But although Foucault may no longer be seen as a phenomenologist ashamed of his preoccupation about power, thus undermining his structuralist prétentions, he nevertheless remains an ambiguous thinker who, in the manner of Heidegger, elaborates an empirico-existential argument with the help of historico-transcendental classifications. However, if Habermas's criticism has the merit of drawing attention to a basic feature of modernity which Foucault leaves aside — namely the "solidification" of collective structures — it fails to offer, as~<br>

Abstract: L'étude se propose de montrer le bien-fondé et la fécondité de l'herméneutique du témoignage en philosophie en interrogeant l'un des problèmes fondamentaux que pose cette pratique, celui du rapport entre singularité et universalité, et ce dans trois champs relevant de la littérature : la littérature au sens large, les mythes littéraires et la Bible. L'étude de la notion de témoignage et de ses déplacements sémantiques dans le témoignage littéraire est inspirée de la philosophie de Paul Ricœur. Les exemples analysés sont ceux du mythe de Faust et de la figure de Job. This study endeavours to show that the hermeneutics of witness in philosophy are indeed well grounded and fecund, by inquiring into one of the essential problems of this practice : that of the relation of the singular to the universal. Three areas relating to literature are broached : literature in a wide sense, myth literature, and the Bible. This study of the idea of witness and its semantic fluctuations in witness literature is inspired by Paul Ricceur's philosophy. The examples analysed here are the Faust myth and the character Job.<br>

Abstract: Confrontation de diverses lectures d'un récit, d'une scène, d'une tradition religieuse. À partir de la figure évangélique de la pécheresse (Luc 7), les analyses philosophiques du pardon s'inscrivent chez le jeune Hegel dans une réflexion sur l'opposition de la loi (le châtiment) et de la réconciliation (l'amour). Dans son Esthétique, les traités de l'art romantique et de la peinture voient en la Madeleine la figuration d'une beauté où intériorité et extériorité s'accordent harmonieusement. Dans divers écrits sur la religion, le même personnage, qui évoque les traits de la belle âme, n'est pas étranger aux méditations sur destin de Jésus, le pardon des offenses et l'idée de la grâce. Ces diverses représentations induisent une pensée en rupture avec d'autres approches philosophiques de la grâce et du pardon (Spinoza, Kant). Une deuxième partie évoque la pécheresse, souvent confondue avec d'autres femmes des Évangiles, telle qu'on la retrouve chez des écrivains de la spiritualité française (Bérulle 1627, Charles de Saint Paul 1628, Lacordaire 1859) et chez les peintres de l'époque baroque. L'article se termine par une étude des nombreuses évocations de la pécheresse chez Kierkegaard. À la différence de la spéculation philosophique ou des « élévations » mystiques, c'est dans une méditation toujours au plus près de la lettre même du Nouveau Testament que sont alors développés de manière existentielle les thèmes du repentir et du pardon. A look at diverse readings of a story, a scene, a religious tradition. Taking the gospel figure of the adulterous woman (Luke 7) as a starting point, the youthful Hegel sets his philosophical analysis of forgiveness in a meditation on Law (Punishment) versus Reconciliation (Love). In his Aesthetics, the treatises on the romantic art movement and on paintings see in Mary Magdalen the figuration of a beauty in which interiority and exteriority are harmonised. In various writings on religion, the same character, now the figuration of the bea~<br>

Author(s): Barthes Charles F.<br>
Abstract: Northrop Frye's recent criticism confronts the contemporary problem raised most powerfully by the Vietnam War-can we find a telos or definition of man on which we can ground our moral reactions and our visions of human development. Frye establishes this telos by an analysis of origins. Contained in a civilization's statements of "concern," in its imaginative treatments of its own condition, one can find an underlying structure of desire which defines the ends of man. This structure and the recurrent images it produces then can serve as the middle terms people use to justify and value their actions. Frye shares his treatment of mediation with contemporary Hegelians like Sartre, Lukács, and Ricoeur, but grounds his absolute in tradition rather than in ideal absolutes or posited evolutionary patterns. Frye's idea of mediation also provides an ethical model for literary criticism: the critic tries to combine literature as product and as cultural possession by interpreting his materials as projections of imaginative desire. Furthermore, we can use Frye to criticize the relativist denial of origins in structuralist critics like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.<br>

Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Article Title: Strangers to Themselves: How Interactants Are other than They Are<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals for the London School of Economics and Political Science<br>
Issue: i225019<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Travers Andrew<br>
Abstract: Analysis of a sequence of literary frames suggests that a heightened experience of interactional reality is also anomically constructive of the frame. In each of 16 frames, Durkheimian anomie neither destroys the frame's integrity nor renders its routine grounds unintelligible, as Goffman and Garfinkel would claim it must. Paradoxically, anomie ritually intensifies the frame. The selves in the paper's sequence of highly ritualized frames are not routine selves, however. They are 'strangers to themselves'. The analysis shows how Mead's 'I' can re-emerge from Goffman's ritual thinking - where the 'I' is collapsed into an interactionally-bound 'me' - as an original manifestation of great importance to interactants, and therefore to society as well. (Parenthetically it is also argued that selves need an element of rituality in order to be selflike and that it is interactional rituality which guarantees the evolution of social life beyond given frames, corpora, cultural repertoires, and collective representations.) The idea that interactants can be strangers to themselves is an advance on Goffman's and Garfinkel's accounts of interactional selfhood, but one that problematizes the prosecution of the interaction sociology that Goffman and Garfinkel pioneer, since strangers to themselves disappear in normal sociological appearances.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i201469<br>
Date: 9 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): Winnicott Allen<br>
Abstract: Psychoanalytic anthropologists assume that folktales often reflect unconscious beliefs and attitudes of listeners, who can tolerate anxiety-provoking images and messages (perhaps wish fulfillments) because these have been projected at a safe distance into the characters in the story. Here I argue that our theory for how such a process occurs is inadequate in terms of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. We need to reexamine a number of questions for which we may have assumed we already have answers, including the nature of repression and how it is accomplished; who or what "hears" an unconscious idea that has been collectively repressed when it is expressed in a folktale; and whether Freud's structural model of id-ego-super-ego can provide an adequate theoretical framework for understanding how unconscious ideas find their way into "expressive culture." I examine these questions in light of a folktale collected among Brazilian peasants. I conclude by questioning the central importance of the ego in repression, and propose a concept of a whole, or supraordinate, self to describe the actual agency in charge of repression.<br>

Author(s): Aliana Serge Bernard Emmanuel<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Abstract: Fitzgerald's particular structural and stylistic approach to nostalgia in
         Gatsby, dividing the narrative into two distinct parts and thus creating both a textual nostalgia and evoking a phenomenological nostalgic experience in the reader, are masterly and consciously accomplished, but they are not unique. Modernist writers used a palette of nostalgic strategies in order to stage their experience of the modern world. Although nostalgia can be considered conservative or reactionary as an idea, the influence it had on modernist literary style is, on the contrary, quite radical. “The melancholic sense of loss,” writes Svetlana Boym, “turned into a style” (16). The sense of transcendental homelessness in combination with nihilism and universal grief that was accentuated by the war and contemporary ideas necessitated a literary style that both confronted the whole project of progress as well as provided a space for emotions that were not considered desirable in a world moving distinctly forward. The nostalgic aesthetic is heavily based on strategies that are formed out of the basic nostalgic and modern dichotomy between future and past, now and then, here and there, which included such varied techniques as temporal re-ordering of events, the nostalgic use of both flashbacks and flash-forwards, the dichotomy between inner time and clock time. Furthermore, the modernists favored inner or outer landscapes of utopian and idealized spaces. Such landscapes could be either simply another past, or more intricately, a phenomenological experience of childhood.<br>

Abstract: Of particular importance for Jabbeh Wesley's ethical attitude toward Liberia and the world is not only the universal, cosmopolitan spirit that guided the poet's choice of names but also the fact that some of the names that might belong to one ethnic group were hybrids created from at least two languages and ethnicities. One such name is Nimley, which is both Grebo and Kru. Grebo and Kru, along with Bassa, are from the Kwa or Klao family of languages. These languages have common roots and are so intermeshed as to defy any search for linguistic purity. By choosing names from these language cultures, the poet raises the specter of wars of brothers against brothers. Given that these were child soldiers, the poet calls Africa's attention not only to senseless fratricidal murder but also to the smothering of the future of Africa itself. The poet thus insinuates a question: Why bring children into a world where they will turn against their parents like Frankenstein's creature? The idea of children turning against their parents is particularly demonstrated by the existence of Dekuah, a spirit child, whose symbolic relevance we shall discuss more fully later.<br>

Abstract: In a similar way, the modern academy, its structures, and it disciplines have been shaped by the ways that religion has been studied, classified, and circumscribed. The term
      religion, as redefined within the conceptual schema of the Enlightenment sciences, created as many or more issues than it resolved. The formulations of religion in this mode were inadequate, especially for those cultures without written languages. They have not shown any great efficacy in making sense of those religions that possess written traditions—the so-called “Great World Religions.” It would be relatively easy to make a survey and description of the various forms of religion within the landmass of Africa and those outside the continent that derive from them. While obvious, such a procedure would not do justice to the manner in which this continental landmass has appeared within the junctures of the time and space of its reality. In order to understand Africana religions, then, it is necessary to establish first a genealogy of Africa in the making of the idea of the modern world.<br>

Abstract: But I'm getting ahead of myself. A clueless graduate student, I wandered onto this pockmarked battlefield in 1964, when I learned that the third SPEP meeting would be held at Yale. (An aside here: if the first meeting was in 1962, shouldn't we be celebrating in 2012? Maybe the first meeting was really in 1961. In any case, I wouldn't know, because I wasn't there.) Some of my fellow graduate students and I were puzzled and wondered what to expect. We thought of phenomenology, and especially existentialism, as rather antiestablishment currents, and the idea of an academic conference devoted to them seemed incongruous. I remember Chip Dallery wondering if there would be an “existentialist smoker.” Some of you may find this hard to believe, but “smoker” was the name given to the evening receptions at conferences like the American Philosophical Association (APA) in those days. The word perfectly encapsulated the hugely male-dominated, tweed-jacketed, pipe-smoking atmosphere of the era. We wondered: Would there be black sweaters and black berets instead of tweeds and Gauloises instead of pipes? Maybe we even enjoyed thinking of ourselves as outsiders and thought the idea of founding a society was too much like imitating the ways of the APA and other establishment groups. We didn't understand the politics of academia or feel the need for establishing ties with like-minded philosophers elsewhere. But that just shows how naive we were.<br>

Abstract: Recently, abolitionists have turned to what they say is their most powerful argument against the death penalty, namely, the execution of an innocent man, Troy Davis, in Georgia in September 2011. Davis was found guilty of killing a police officer while attempting to escape the scene of a robbery. The argument that the criminal justice system can make mistakes, however, is not an argument against the
      principleof the death penalty. Neither is the argument that lethal injection is cruel and unusual. Rather, these arguments allow that although the practice is flawed, the principle may be sound; if only we improve and perfect the practice, then we authorize the principle. The fantasy of humane painless instant death, technologically administered, contributes not only to the idea of the perfection of the means of death in order to justify the principle of the death penalty but also to the fantasy of death itself as anabsolute, in this case, the absolute end of suffering and pain.<br>

Abstract: The paradigm of this conception of possible limits is Immanuel Kant, for German idealism; but the one who articulated the starkly analogous issue in Husserlian phenomenology is Eugen Fink. Kant's raising of the issue was instantly famous; Fink's formulation of it in his “Sixth Cartesian Meditation: The Idea of a Transcendental Theory of Method” was never published during Husserl's or his lifetime,
            
                  and for that reason it was recognized as stating a fundamental problem by only a few thinkers in phenomenology other than Husserl himself and Fink.3
               
                  Heidegger had never seen it, nor does he appear to have himself discerned in his own thinking the issue Fink's essay lays out. Merleau-Ponty, in contrast, was quite appreciative of the issue. Finally, one has to mention Jan Patočka, a close friend of Fink's from his first visit to Freiburg in 1933 through to the end of his life.4
               
                  For Patočka the move to an “a-subjective phenomenology,” together with a point he makes about the inaccessibility of the “bottom” for “the human reach for meaning” in his essay “Does History Have a Meaning?” gives indication of Patočka's grasp of at least the principles of this same methodological issue.5
               
                  This situation, now, sets up the final fundamental feature for phenomenological investigation in the6

Abstract: Finally, we come to the
            now, the fourth phase of critical theory. September 11, the resurgence of religion, the clash of civilizations, globalization—these are the issues not only confronting the world but also confronting critical theory. Although some might argue with this assumption, it appears to me that critical theory, given its origins in the German enlightenment, has a vested interest in a certain theory of modernity. Whether one uses the Kantian model fromWhat Is Enlightenment?the Hegelian model based on a certain philosophy of history, Marx's idea of the social evolution of society, Weber's idea of the disenchantment of the world, or Horkheimer's classic distinction between traditional and critical theory, critical theory manifests a distinct orientation to modernity that links modernization with secularization. My guess is that the great challenge to critical theory that has to deal with the rise of religion, on the one hand, and globalization, on the other, will be whether or not it can keep a critical perspective alive or whether in the future we will look back at critical theory as just another theory of modernity.<br>

Abstract: In the SPEP volume published in 1983 and made up of selected papers from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth meetings, the editors, William McBride and Calvin Schrag, commented on the “radicality, openness, passion for dialogue, freedom, and interest in pluralism” that the included papers made apparent. The year 1984 marked a significant turning point especially for the organization. The Committee on the Status of Women formed with the purpose of increasing the participation of women in SPEP. In 1981 six women participated in the program, three of them as moderators. In 1982 four women participated, one as moderator, and Joan Stambaugh gave an invited paper at the Nietzsche Society. In 1983 nine women participated, and two others gave papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. In 1984, five women participated, with one moderator among them, and there were three women giving papers at the Society for Phenomenology and the Human Sciences. Then, after the founding of the Committee on the Status of Women in 1984, the program in 1985 had sixteen women on the program inclusive of two moderators, a keynote address by Julia Kristeva, and a book session on Ofelia Shutte's book
         Beyond Nihilism. One woman gave a paper at the Nietzsche Society. In that year Arleen Dallery became the first woman elected to SPEP's Executive Committee. The voting members at the twenty-fifth SPEP conference in 1986 selected Professor Dallery as the first woman co-director of SPEP, and twenty-four women were on the program, with four moderators. A panel discussed Linda Nicholson's bookGender and History, and Joan Stambaugh gave the paper “The Future of Continental Philosophy” in a plenary session symposium. Also in that year, at a tumultuous business session, the membership agreed that the Executive Committee would provide annually statistics on the number of papers by women that were submitted and that were accepted.

Abstract: I will borrow this idea here to illustrate how a new technology transforms in new ways our relations to the world and thus concentrate what I have outlined above. First, the cell phone may come close to being the early twenty-first century's almost universal technology. Social scientists claim that
            95 percent of the global population today has access to cell phones! Not all have cell phones; for example, in Bangladesh, “phone ladies” supplied with cell phones provided by the Grameen Bank service entire villages. But also the cell phone is a “leapfrog technology” in that it skips the long evolution of wired systems and can sprout up in remote and undeveloped territories. Maasai warriors can communicate in the bush with them. But I turn to the characteristics I have claimed for new technologies and provocatively compare these with Heidegger's hammer:
                  
            
                     
                  •
                     First, what of
                  readiness-to-hand? This part of Heidegger's still phenomenological description applies to both. In use, both the hammer and cell phone “withdraw” and become the embodied means of praxis, not its goal. Both have “assignments” and belong to complex relationships with the environment, and both reveal the worldliness of the world—but even without further description you no doubt are already aware that the size, shape, and reach of these assignments are vastly different. The hammer remains embodied bodily; the cell phone includes hermeneutic relations and alterity relations as well.
                     
                  •
                     In this latter context one can note that both the hammer and cell phone are multistable, but in vastly different ways. Classical hammers exemplified different uses through different, largely single-style designs: carpenters' hammers, cobblers' hammers, tack hammers, sledgehammers. Cell phones are deliberately multitask designed—audio phone, text cap~<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In my own opinion the most interesting expression of the religious turn in Continental philosophy is found in Derrida because Derrida is by anyone's standards a secular thinker and even, by the standards of the local pastor or rabbi, an atheist. So it came as a shock to read about Derrida's “religion” in his famous “Circumfession” (1989), which is a deconstructive riff on Augustine's
            Confessionsin which Derrida restages the scene of theConfessions. We come upon a scene in which the speaker (Augustine/Jackie), an emigrant from North Africa to the Big Apple (Rome/Paris), has his back to us and is praying to someone (te, God/tu), while his mother (Monica/Georgette) lies dying on the northern shore of the Mediterranean (Ostia/Nice). Derrida tells us that he has been praying all his life and that no one, not even his mother, has understood this, which has led to a misunderstanding of his work.
                  But to whom is Derrida praying, and how could he be praying at all? Does he not “rightly pass for an atheist”?20
               
                  There is a more obscure sense of religion “without religion” in Derrida, and a prayer to a God not only unknown but nonexistent that nonetheless constitutes a genuine prayer. If, as Jean-Louis Chrétien says, himself one of the new religious phenomenologists,21
               prayeris a “wounded word,” what word is more wounded than a word from one who does not know to whom he is praying (a lost letter, destination unknown), or if anyone is there to hear his prayers, or if he is praying at all, who has to pray to be able to pray at all, for something, he knows not what, something “coming,” the coming or incoming (invention) of something unforeseeable?
                  Derrida's atheism is crucially important to his religion because it allows him to isolate the very structure of prayer, and hence of the religious posture, with or without what we in the great monotheisms call “God,” thereby putting into questi~<br>

Abstract: Catherine Malabou's “Can We Relinquish the Transcendental?” offers a sustained critical engagement with the work of Quentin Meillassoux, particularly his book
      After Finitude, where Meillassoux argues for a relinquishing or an abandonment of the transcendental. As Malabou notes, relinquishing the transcendental means relinquishing Kant, especially the notion of a priori conditions of possibility, which also means relinquishing the foundation or cornerstone of continental philosophy. Malabou traces various twentieth-century attempts to relinquish the transcendental in the work of philosophers such as Heidegger, Derrida, and Foucault and then argues that none of these thinkers goes as far as Meillassoux. While Heidegger, Derrida, and Foucault relinquish the transcendental, Meillassoux abandons it, where this means that he abandons the idea of irreducibility. Malabou agrees with Meillassoux that, up to now, all attempts to abandon the transcendental have led to an embrace of a poetic mode of thinking that has reinforced a problematic split between continental philosophy and science. Unlike Meillassoux, however, Malabou thinks that the true abandonment of the transcendental cannot, as he suggests, leave the world as it is. Abandoning the transcendental has more radical implications than this, including accepting the idea that nothing about us is irreducible: our philosophical categories are reducible to biological concepts, which means that the transcendental itself is in the brain.<br>

Abstract: For example, if one reads the polemical hyperbolic statement “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God” (Mark 10:25, NRSV), then one hears a physical impossibility and an errant statement.
         
               Of course, there are several exegetical issues here, but in general, it will commonly be acknowledged that it is physically impossible for a camel to perform this task. Yet it is assumed by many that rich people can and do participate within the kingdom of God, in which case the claim that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God is not only an impossibility but a lie that is not intended to deceive. In the face of such a shocking or surprising incongruity, one is forced to look beyond the exaggeration for other truth(s) that might be indicated by the errancy, that is, to the idea that it is extremely difficult to enter the kingdom of God if one is driven by wealth alone.7<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Abstract: However, this does not mean that in attempting to fill the philosophical gap Kant bequeaths his interlocutors, Ricoeur accepts Kantian thought wholesale. He does not. While he endorses the notion of limits, Ricoeur rejects an ethics built exclusively on the idea of duty.
         
               Ricoeur does so largely because he thinks Kant mistakes the second phase of ethical theory for the first. For Ricoeur, the foundation or first phase of ethics is the teleological tilt toward ends, purposes, and the good. It is not the Kantian deontological tilt toward rules, obligations, and the right, which is derivative and comes second. A third and pivotal evaluative phase completes the ethical arc for Ricoeur: the dialectical tilt toward practical judgment in context (what Aristotle called31
            phronesis), which requires that deontological norms be measured for degrees of compliance against the supreme (first-phase) teleological standard of meritorious living before they are implemented in concrete situations.
               On Ricoeur's view, Kant's ethics of duty does not encompass the full spectrum of moral relations. It is too narrow. Beyond the difficulties associated with its formalism and ironclad maxims, Kantian ethics acknowledges only one legitimate source of moral motivation (acting out of respect for the law), whereas Ricoeur believes there are valid springs of ethical behavior beyond unadulterated practical reason. Desires, interests, fears, and aspirations to attain basic human goods and happiness are all licit motivational factors in the ethics Ricoeur valorizes.32<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: What is left unsaid in this article about the relationship between utopia and rhetoric could certainly fill the pages of many books. The range is especially rich when we turn to contemporary rhetorical theorists who specifically address society as a value to be combined with a remembered or imagined better place, as in Nedra Reynolds's
      Geographies of Writingor bell hooks'sBelonging: A Culture of Place.
               Just as constitutive rhetoric (that is, cumulative discourse that contributes to building the structure of human society) has been important in the works of theorists often cited by utopists as crucial to their work, so the utopian impulse continues to be inherent in the way rhetoricians see their subject. To persuade verbally or visually, we must have our own idea of what is socially better, and we must also be able to imagine what our audience believes to be better. The function of utopia, then, may be less philosophical and ideological at its root than it is linguistic in a pragmatic sense. As Kenneth Burke has written of human beings, we are “the symbol-making, symbol-using, symbol-misusing animal … rotten with perfection.”38

Abstract: This unceasing flow is precisely what, according to Julia Kristeva, articulates the semiotic function of writing in what she calls a “pulsating
         chora”
               —an idea glossed by Brivic as “the level of maternal pulsation in language.”158
            
               Kristeva identifies this159
            choraas a “totality formed by the [semiotic] drives … in a motility that is as full of movement as it is regulated.”
               She cites Joyce's work as representative of that rare set of literary texts that “cover the infinity of the [signifying] process, that is, reach the semiotic160
            chora.”
               In that Joyce's writing confronts patriarchal regulation with this deconstructive, progressive, and chaotic flow, its attraction to feminist theorists is clear: as Brivic notes, “Joyce's experiments directly inspired two of the leading thinkers of the161
            écriture fémininemovement, Hélène Cixous and Julia Kristeva.”
               Like poststructuralist feminism, Joyce's work advances a mode of Utopianism that necessarily resists categorization. In discussing her notion of162
            écriture féminine(a literary form in which she includes Joyce's work—indeed she wrote her doctoral thesis on Joyce),
               Hélène Cixous has suggested that it is impossible to define such modes of writing and that “this is an impossibility that will remain, for this practice can never be theorized, enclosed, coded—which doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.”163
            
               While Herbert Marcuse may have suggested that the Utopian is validated by its categorization as such (and thereby by its exclusion from normative, hegemonic discourse), the mode of Utopianism expressed by Kristeva's164
            choraor Cixous'sécriture féminineis validated by virtue of the fact that it cannot be so categorized. Like Joyce's “word known to all men,”
               Utopia is too fluid for such reductive definition.165<br>

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>

Abstract: But the emphasis on failure as a product of design, or as a consequence of somehow having arrived at the wrong style, arguably forecloses on utopian possibility in architecture. As K. G. Bristol observes, adoption of the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe as representative of the failings of modern architecture, and as a marker of its demise, has at its core “the idea that architectural design was responsible for the demise of Pruitt-Igoe.”
         
               Hiding in this insight is a contribution to sharpening an understanding of just how Utopia might be alternatively construed in architecture, shedding light on how any understanding of Utopia that begins and ends with form (with design), with representation or spatial closure alone, really must be abandoned before Utopia can make a meaningful contribution to imagining architecture and the city in all their depth. As noted earlier, Harvey has conceptualized a first step in this direction in his development of “dialectical utopianism,” which turns on the necessity for “spatial closure” to be adjoined with the equal necessity of “social process” in the proposition of any Utopia that might take a concrete form.23<br>

Abstract: Medical humanities and ethics are getting more and more important in Europe as essential disciplines of the core curriculum for health-care professionals. The idea of the physician as a technician shows itself to be unbearable because of the global historical changes we daily face in caring settings. We deal with chronic diseases, which require a sensitive physician/patient covenant and a good performance in communication skills1 because a whole life-style transformation is often necessary. Moreover, citizens are more informed about both the technological progress and their civil rights, so that a shared decision has to be prepared and implemented by exploring the emotional reactions to illness, by explaining the effects of different ways of treatment, and by revealing in advance the choices that could be taken.<br>

Article Title: ‘Performing History: The Importance of Occasions’<br>
Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
Issue: portstudies.27.1.issue-1<br>
Date: January 27, 1960<br>
Abstract: This article begins by considering the diverse ways in which Gilberto Freyre used his key concept of mesticagem and the different cultural fields to which he extended it — architecture, cuisine, sport, literature, urban studies, sociology and even sex. Noting the alternative concepts or metaphors in Freyre’s work — interpenetration, mixture, hybridity and so on — it goes on to discuss a metaphor that he did not use, although it has become popular since his time, ‘cultural translation’. A brief history of the idea of cultural translation and a consideration of its strengths and weaknesses leads to a casestudy of both the literal and the metaphorical translation of the western concept of liberty to Japan after the imperial restoration of 1868.<br>
