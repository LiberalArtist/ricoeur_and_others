  Book Title: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity-Trajectories of Israeli & Palestinian Symbol Use<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Frank David A.<br>
  Abstract: Shared Land/Conflicting Identity: Trajectories of Israeli and Palestinian Symbol Useargues that rhetoric, ideology, and myth have played key roles in influencing the development of the 100-year conflict between first the Zionist settlers and the current Israeli people and the Palestinian residents in what is now Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is usually treated as an issue of land and water. While these elements are the core of the conflict, they are heavily influenced by the symbols used by both peoples to describe, understand, and persuade each other. The authors argue that symbolic practices deeply influenced the Oslo Accords, and that the breakthrough in the peace process that led to Oslo could not have occurred without a breakthrough in communication styles.Rowland and Frank develop four crucial ideas on social development: the roles of rhetoric, ideology, and myth; the influence of symbolic factors; specific symbolic factors that played a key role in peace negotiations; and the identification and value of criteria for evaluating symbolic practices in any society.<br>

  Abstract: The Arabs of Palestine maintained a strong communal identification with the land of Palestine and Jerusalem for many centuries, an expression that took a nationalist form in the early twentieth century.¹ Before 1881, there was no need for a distinct “Palestinian” identity or nation. From 1514 to the end of World War I, the Arab residents of Palestine saw themselves as members of a vast Arab nation, as residents of the three local districts of southern Syria, as Moslem or Christian, and primarily as members of village and familial units.² When the conflict with the Zionists became intense and the<br>

  Abstract: By the middle of the twentieth century, the critical question concerning Canto VI was no longer one of historical identification or aesthetic appreciation, but of whether the canto was substantially unified or, instead, contained a series of poetically unresolved issues. Aurelio Roncaglia, in his “Lectura Dantis” of 1955, showed that the repetition of disjunctive verbs such as
                  si parte(“is done,” 1),disgiunto(“without a passageway,” 42),non m’accompagne(“not at my side,” 114), andscisso(“dissevered,” 123) creates a “convulsive marker” connecting the various parts of the canto.

  Abstract: The elasticity of Christianity, as it has accommodated itself to two thousand years of cultural change, is well known; and it poses special problems for the identification of a peculiarly “Christian” conception of what it means to be an adult. It is also likely to make any attempt at such definition seem arbitrary. I shall nevertheless try to show in this essay that Christianity does contain a characteristic conception of healthy human maturity, but to do so it will be necessary to distinguish between what I shall call

  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the indispensable role that, as Homi K. Bhabha suggests, “forgetting” plays in the construction of national subjectivity: “Being obliged to forget becomes the basis for remembering the nation, peopling it anew, imagining the possibility of other contending and liberating forms of cultural identification.”¹ Most of the classical ideologues of nationalism assert that the nation is a form of collective identity grounded in a shared sense of the past. Ernest Renan, for example, maintains in his influential 1882 lecture, “
                  Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?” (the subject of Bhabha’s comments as well), that two things constitute the “soul or spirit”<br>

Engaging with Benedict Anderson’s thesis of the modularity of nationalism (Anderson 1991, 4, 87), Chatterjee suggests that postcolonial nationhood does indeed stand in a quasi-dialogic relationship with European models of nationality, yet it nevertheless exhibits irreducible difference from them, since it is crucially shaped by the conditions of the colonial encounter (Chatterjee 1993).

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  Author(s) Hamacher Werner<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to what many liberals had predicted, instead of becoming obsolete thanks to the development of “post conventional identities” and the increasing role of rationality in human behavior, religious forms of identification currently play a growing role in many societies. Yet the question of what should be the place of the church in a liberal democracy is a burning issue in several of the new Eastern European democracies. It seems, therefore, that the old controversy about the relationship between religion and politics, far from being on the wane, is again on the agenda.<br>

  Book Title: Time and world politics-Thinking the present<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hutchings Kimberly<br>
  Abstract: This book offers the first authoritative guide to assumptions about time in theories of contemporary world politics. It demonstrates how predominant theories of the international or global ‘present’ are affected by temporal assumptions, grounded in western political thought, that fundamentally shape what we can and cannot know about world politics today. The first part of the book traces the philosophical roots of assumptions about time in contemporary political theory. The second part examines contemporary theories of world politics, including liberal and realist International Relations theories and the work of Habermas, Hardt and Negri, Virilio and Agamben. In each case, it is argued, assumptions about political time ensure the identification of the particular temporality of western experience with the political temporality of the world as such and put the theorist in the unsustainable position of holding the key to the direction of world history. In the final chapter, the book draws on postcolonial and feminist thinking, and the philosophical accounts of political time in the work of Derrida and Deleuze, to develop a new ‘untimely’ way of thinking about time in world politics.<br>

This article hews close to the contours of the present text, not attempting to go any further back into the history of the text than the pre–dtr level represented by Joshua 2. Joshua 1 provides the introduction to the deuteronomistic text of the book of Joshua.¹ It is a possibility worth considering that Joshua 2 provides the introduction to an earlier narrative version, with a significantly different presentation of the traditions. Identification of this possible narrative raises issues around the development of a theology of extermination.<br>

  Book Title: Forbidden Fictions-Pornography and Censorship in Twentieth-Century French Literature<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Phillips John<br>
  Abstract: ‘Phillips discusses texts by Apollinaire, Pierre Loüys, Georges Bataille, Pauline Réage, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Tony Duvert, Elizabeth Barillé and Marie Darrieussecq, engaging in different levels of critical analysis so as to emphasize intertextual and parodic elements in one case, or points of possible identification in another.’ TLS French culture has long been perceived by the English-speaking reader as somehow more ‘erotic’ than its Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Forbidden Fictions is the first English-language study devoted exclusively to the wide spectrum of French literary pornography in the twentieth century. John Phillips provides a broad history of the genre and the associated moral and political issues. Among the texts examined in detail – all selected for their literary or sociopolitical importance – are landmark works by Apollinaire, Louÿs, Bataille, Réage, Robbe-Grillet, Arsan, and Duvert. Phillips challenges current politically correct trends in literary criticism and stereotyped censoring discourses about pornography to provide a new reading of each text and to illustrate the genre’s potential for social subversion. Forbidden Fictions addresses the most controversial issues of contemporary sexual politics, such as objectification, sadomasochism, homoeroticism and paedophilia, with particular emphasis on the feminist debate on pornography. In the light of current controversy over the control of pornography, this is a timely and scholarly review of the ethical, moral and social arguments surrounding the censorship of sexually explicit material.<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

This book has sought to bring into relief a thread that undulates throughout his system. At times this thread, the God of Israel, is a prominent identification in Jenson’s formulations, and at other times the identification is below the surface. Even so, it is never absent. I have argued that Jenson’s attention to the centrality of God’s identity as the God of Israel permeates his theology, and its profound importance for Christian theology is convincingly developed<br>

But what is given, we now see, cannot be restricted to the contracted concreteness of the particular thing. Thus the four degrees of concreteness previously discussed are modes of appearance of the thing, progressively more complex presentations of its otherness; correlatively, the four modes of identification are increasingly ample acknowledgments of its inherent richness.

  Author(s) Roy Matthieu<br>
  Abstract: En Europe, le débat sur l’entreprise sociale a émergé durant les années 1990 à la suite de l’identification de dynamiques entrepreneuriales innovantes centrées sur la primauté de la finalité sociale. Ces initiatives se sont inscrites, pour la plupart, au sein du « troisième secteur ». Les concepts d’entreprise sociale et d’innovation sociale se sont également largement diffusés dans l’arène des institutions européennes. Si l’innovation sociale ne se limite pas au champ des entreprises sociales, ce type d’entreprise demeure un acteur central de l’innovation sociale. Cependant, derrière ces discours, les conceptions de l’entreprise sociale et de l’innovation sociale sont multiformes. Ce<br>

  Abstract: The present paper aims at investigating — both theoretically and in the context of the Early Mycenaean period in mainland Greece (Table 26.1) — the relation of funerary rituals with processes of shaping, negotiating and transmitting collective identities. In particular, I wish to explore the role of specially designated ritual spaces (in this case, the
                  dromoiof Mycenaean tombs) as frameworks for the creation of embodied experiences of shared remembering and identification. In this effort, I will draw extensively on anthropological literature examining rituals as public performances.

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

The representation of mother figures in popular Bollywood films¹ has changed considerably over the years. This paper explores the representations of “ diasporic” mother figures as portrayed in popular films post-1990 and takes into consideration the effects of feminist consciousness, which, in turn, has been fuelled by globalization. Indian diaspora audiences are increasingly engaging in processes of identification with the themes of Bollywood films.

  Abstract: Ouvrage clé permettant de comprendre le rôle politique des fondations subventionnaires, le présent collectif est la première grande synthèse de l’histoire de la philanthropie canadienne et québécoise. Dès le début du XXe siècle, la dimension sociopolitique des organisations philanthropiques a été remise en question : quelle légitimité d’action pouvaient avoir des acteurs privés fortunés dans le domaine de l’entraide ? Cet ouvrage répond à cette question en se basant sur une variété de travaux dirigés par différentes équipes de recherche. Plusieurs thèmes centraux sont abordés : survol historique et comparatif du rôle des fondations, au Québec, au Canada et ailleurs ; proposition de classification théorique et empirique des fondations ; caractérisation des relations entre les différents acteurs de l’éco­système philanthropique ; identification des stratégies mobilisées par ces différents acteurs ; réflexions sur le rôle des fondations dans la création de politiques publiques… Ce livre propose une vue d’ensemble éclairante du secteur de la philanthropie subventionnaire qui, malgré son champ d’action restreint, demeure fondamental dans les reconfigurations sociales en cours.<br>

  Abstract: In a 1988 interview, Levinas claims that the “essential theme of my research is the deformalization of the notion of time” (OUJ 232). At first glance, this identification of time as his “essential theme” seems counterintuitive, given his steadfast focus on the nature of responsibility and the subject’s relation to alterity. However, how we understand time shapes how we understand the self, and Levinas argues that a formal conception of time supports the modern ideal of autonomous subjectivity.

The strangeness of the political position Rice is attempting commands attention. Are Rice’s efforts to realign Republican foreign policy with a civil rights agenda sincere?

My contextual and empirical work with audiences is crucial to the conclusion that much of the political power of sentimental postmodernism can be found in the intense identifications that it fosters both within and across sexual identities, genders, and ethnicities.

To escape this “dictatorship of fundaments, foundations, technologies of measurement, universalities, and idealities,”² Krell proposes that architecture needs to revisit Husserl’s genealogy of geometry, resuscitating his notions of the pregeometric and protogeometric: “It must learn, for example, to dally with<br>

  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Author(s) King Richard H.<br>
  Abstract: It would be hard to find another thesis in political theory less questioned than the traditional identification of violence and politics. This is true to such an extent that the possibility of a nonviolent politics may seem chimerical, likewise that of tracing a conceptual distinction between power and violence. Even if it is true that not all violent phenomena are political phenomena, we tend to feel quite certain that there could be no politics without violence. As we know, Hannah Arendt is among those very few thinkers in contemporary political theory who refuse the strict identification of politics and violence,<br>

  Abstract: The idea of the road movie as a film populated by rebellious, counter-cultural protagonists has come to be a dominant one, especially in light of the New Hollywood films that took to the road.

  Author(s) Diawara Manthia<br>
  Abstract: The “Afro” style of movement and performance began in Brazil in the seventies among radicalized sectors of the Black-mixtured community as a way to recuperate and politicize inherited African cultural practices that had been co-opted by the dictatorship as simply folklore, part of “our Brazilian Heritage.” Twenty years later, it appears that this particular style of dance has a fixed set of codes from which the dancer may construct/choreograph meaning into a performance. This position, however, reinstates the paradigm of the “folk” into a dynamic process of identification, communication, and insertion within transnational discourses about the various cultures of people<br>

  Book Title: The Lebanese Diaspora-The Arab Immigrant Experience in Montreal, New York, and Paris<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Abdelhady Dalia<br>
  Abstract: The Lebanese are the largest group of Middle Eastern immigrants in the United States, and Lebanese immigrants are also prominent across Europe and the Americas. Based on over eighty interviews with first-generation Lebanese immigrants in the global cities of New York, Montreal and Paris, this book shows that the Lebanese diaspora - like all diasporas - constructs global relations connecting and transforming their new societies, previous homeland and world-wide communities. Taking Lebanese immigrants' forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.The Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapters analyze forms of identification and social solidarity created by members of the Lebanese diaspora. On the one hand, Lebanese immigrants are in a constant process of identifying with their homeland and host societies. Additionally, they identify with other members of the larger diaspora, which leads to their engagement in global communities. This chapter addresses the topic of diasporic cultural expression to illustrate ways in which the Lebanese diaspora engages in global and local cultural practices that parallel their multilayered forms of identification and community involvement.

  Abstract: It is a widespread convention that the identification of the initial audience is a necessary preliminary to the proper understanding of New Testament texts and so belongs to the introductory matter, for example, of a commentary. With regard to the Johannine Epistles, two elements in such an identification have achieved an unusually high degree of consensus. The first is that the letters are addressed to “the Johannine community” (or, less commonly now, the Johannine circle), a conviction that has played an important role in resisting, at least for the Fourth Gospel, the contention that the “Gospels [were] for all Christians”<br>

  Abstract: On December 2005, Evo Morales won Bolivia’s presidential election by one of the widest margins in the country’s democratic history, while his party, Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), gained control of congress. The margin of victory (54 per cent of the votes and 25 percentage points ahead of his closest opponent) was, perhaps, overshadowed by Morales self-identification as an indigenous person and as a staunch critic of the neo-liberal project as neo-colonial and undemocratic. This victory raised many doubts from critics and opponents, who saw Morales as unprepared to assume the responsibilities of governing a country. However, under his leadership Bolivia<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  Abstract: The preceding explorations of nationalism and European identity reveal how much the fate and prospects of particular identifications and hegemonic projects rely on the affective dimension, on 
                  jouissance in its different modalities and interactions with the world of signification and social practice. Obviously the emergence of the ‘new’ cannot succeed if it ignores this important parameter, but this is not to say that sedimented, libidinally invested identifications are in any way privileged to retain their hegemonic position indefinitely. Processes of dis-identification and affective re-investment are, on the contrary, part and parcel of social and political life. In capitalist – especially late<br>

  Abstract: Evolutionary psychology, a recently constituted but already broadly extended programme in the study of human behaviour, is notable for, among other things, the unusually pre-emptive character of its claims. According to its major proponents, ‘reverse engineering’, the method that defines and distinguishes evolutionary psychology, permits identification of the underlying, innate mental mechanisms that govern all human behaviour, from incest-avoidance and femaleadolescent anorexia to past-tense formation and a taste for Victorian novels. In supplying these identifications, it is said, evolutionary psychologists provide genuinely scientific explanations for human behaviours and cultural practices that, up to now, have been improperly or inadequately explained<br>

Nationalism as a mass movement, Hobsbawm indicates, is a final stage, coming after the formation of a state.

Abstract: Focusing on this dynamism of language and communicative practice is one way of deepening the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis. The core idea is that it is not just languageassystem (especially languageascategorizationsystem) that shapes worldview and the horizons of the meaningful within a given culture or speech community but also daily habits of communicating analogous to what Whorf (1941) called the habitual grooves of talking. Because these habits are embedded within specific contexts and institutions (e.g., the mass media, education, families, courts, marketplaces, and the practice of anthropology), there is room for a fourth paradigm in which identification as a linguistic anthropologist is less important than placing the ethnography of communication at the center of any anthropological project.

Abstract: The epistemological function of analogy has also been a subject of vigorous debate among philosophers and rhetoricians. Ever since Roman Jakobson’s famous (
         1973) postulation of the fundamental polarity between metaphor and metonymy at the very heart of language, the two poles have marked differences between relationships of resemblance and contiguity, Freudian identification and symbolism as opposed to displacement and condensation, or poetry and prose (Jakobson1973, 126). For Jakobson, the two modes represent not only verbal differences but cultural patterns (1973, 123). Understandably, analogy and resemblance, as constituent elements of metaphor, have not fared well with poststructuralism’s emphasis on heterogeneity. Although Paul Ricoeur ([1975] 1977) attempts to resuscitate metaphor from its disrepute by emphasizing the play of similarity and difference in metaphor and by associating resemblance “as the site of clash between sameness and difference” ([1975] 1977, 196), he does not bridge the divide between relations of likeness and unlikeness and those of contiguity. While I do not wish to claim any utopian possibilities for metonymy or posit a neat structuralist break between metonymy and metaphor, I find that the reliance on a dominant mode of analogy and metaphor amid postmodern gender/sexuality theorizing reveals the epistemological fracture caused by racial difference. Therefore, I argue that the role of racial analogy, resemblance, and metaphor within feminist/gender theory needs to be thoroughly investigated. Postcolonial theory has already revealed how analogy and metaphor have been fundamental in constituting colonial discourse. As Edward Said so powerfully demonstrated, Orientalism as colonial discourse operated in part by making woman a metaphor for the Orient (1978, 6, 187–88). And the disciplining of the colonies only involved the flip side of analogy—the postulation of absolute difference between colonizer and colonized, civilized and pri~<br>

Abstract: See Hans‐Georg Gadamer,
            Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall, 2nd ed. and 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Crossroad, 1989; Continuum, 1998); Emmanuel Levinas,Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority, trans. Alphonso Lingis (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1969), 33–52. Levinas argues that dialogue is founded upon the asymmetrical relationship between the self and the infinite Other (“Dialogue … is a thinking of theunequal, a thought thinkingbeyondthe given” [Emmanuel Levinas,God Who Comes to Mind, trans. Bettina Bergo (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 151]) and in that sense not a method of uncovering truth but a call to (self‐) transcendence, i.e., to ethics (ibid., 143–51). Levinas’s purely asymmetrical ethical understanding of the self‐other relation, in which the practice of dialogue is reduced to the infinite Other’s “breaking in” and rupturing of the totalizing horizon of my world, is meant as a critique of Hegel’s more symmetrical, interdependent, and holistic understanding of the self‐other relation in terms of mutual recognition. But this criticism is predicated on what in my view is an unconvincing identification of holism, which is an internally differentiated harmony, with totality, which is devoid of internal differentiation whatsoever. I follow Paul Ricoeur’s more Hegelian, dialectical understanding of the self‐other relation (that is at the same time informed by the Levinasian critique), in which the horizon of my world is driven by its own logic to a universalizability test via the sieve of the other’s scrutiny and is transformed in the process.

Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: The particularly distinctive element of Christian typology is its ascription of titles, actions, and qualities to Jesus.
         47This pattern of reading, while at work throughout the Gospels, is particularly intense in Christ’s resurrection. Frei reads Luke 24:13–35, where Jesus meets the disciples on the road to Emmaus, as central to Christian reading.48In Jesus’s interpretation of the scriptures with respect to himself—ascriptively—the narrative pattern of interpretation emerges from within the Gospel narrative itself. “He, the unsubstitutable Jesus, now makes the stylized titles his own. He claims them for himself in his very identity of Jesus of Nazareth.”49To recognize that Jesus’s self‐identification as the Son of God is actualized in the resurrection, emerging contingently within the story, makes the Christian naming of Jesus as the Son of God dependent upon engagement with the narrative sense. To engage in narrative interpretation, then, is tofollowJesus’s act of self‐ascription—or, really, to obey his obedience. One ascribes this name to Jesus, because God, through Jesus’s action, ascribes it to him in the resurrection. Ascription, then, is, first, Jesus’s own practice, second, the practice of the Gospel writers, and, third, the practice of reading constitutive of the Christian community.50Ascription thus constitutes a particular form of “double‐dialogue,” as the text brings together the divine act of reading by Jesus and the community’s act of reading in response.51<br>

Abstract: The difficulty is to understand exactly Nora's use of the term
         lieux de mémoire.Nora borrowed it from Frances Yates, but he did not employ it, as Yates did, to designate the tangible ordered places/palaces to which information is attached in order to be individually preserved as memory in oral tradition. Instead, he used it to designate the exterritorialized sites of collective memory. The category “collective memory” itself is utilized as a metaphor for history, which imposes on society one particular vision to be remembered. Nora captures the whole process at a moment when the identification with living memory has disappeared. The sites of memory he describes are like “moments of history torn away from the movement of history, then returned. No longer quite alive, not yet dead, they are like seashells on the shore from which the sea of living memory has retreated.”9WhenLe Grand Robertincluded the phrase in 1993, it used this explanation by Nora as its definition. Nora approachedles lieux de mémoireas objects, places, or ideals transformed by human agency or time into “symbolic element[s] of the inherited touchstones of memory of a community.”10<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur drives his investigation with his characteristic hermeneutical analysis of both canonical and unanticipated authors. The first chapter covers the field of “Recognition as Identification” with texts of Descartes, Kant, and Marcel Proust. Knowledge theories have indeed treated “recognition as identification” under the heading of judgment: that of judging an object as “the same” through an identification process. Ricoeur traces in the
      Meditationsof Descartes the occurrences of the verb “to recognize” at moments following expression of doubts and hesitations. As is the case in the subsequent discussion of Kant, Ricoeur does not directly engage the issues here. His goal is instead to show that these canonical theories of knowledge miss an important lesson of recognition.<br>

Abstract: The practical and normative ethics of our profession will undoubtedly be accompanied by emotive and affective reactions. After all, human action is motivated by emotion, cognition, reason, and other things. The profession’s desire to identify core values is a product of these multiple motivations. Just as identification of a core value requires an explication of what qualities are attached to a thing that is valued and for whom the thing is valuable and why, so too does discourse ethics in general require such full argumentation. More than just formal argument, though, discourse ethics entails participation broadly; it invites those concerned to have a voice within the communicative endeavor. The voicing, however, follows some norms that are aimed at the outcome of the deliberation—workable and agreed‐upon practices. Habermas says that “discourse ethics, then, stands or falls with two assumptions: (
         a) that normative claims to validity have cognitive meaning and can be treated like claims to truth and (b) that the justification of norms and commands requires that a real discourse be carried out and thus cannot occur in a strictly monological form” [35, p. 68]. Habermas presents an ideal that can suggest a beginning for the furtherance of a practical and normative ethics for librarianship.<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: At this point, however, I would only like to highlight the fact that for Derrida the prime responsibility of the European is one toward the tradition of the discourses and counterdiscourses concerning his own identification. This point is made even more explicitly, though in more general terms, in
      For What Tomorrow … A Dialogue, where Derrida remarks that “the concept of responsibility has no sense at all outside of an experience of inheritance.”4We should remind ourselves of it as we turn toward Derrida’s discussion of a discourse on Europe that he characterizes as heretical “with respect to all the important [or grand] European discourses.”5All the possibilities of the grand discourses of Europe have apparently been exhausted. And, yet, Jan Patočka’s views on Europe and European responsibility, which have the capacity to produce explosive implications if extended radically, sound a heretical note within the traditional discourses of the modern Western world, not the least because they also seek to break the ties to a certain memory and to a certain tradition.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: The current return to a historical present teeming with competing temporalities from the past recalls both repetitions from other times and places and what perceiving them meant for social theory. Specifically, this recognition refers to those attempts envisaged by people like Tosaka and Maurice Halbwachs before World War II who sought to account for the spectacle of mixed temporalities in the present. Both, it is important to acknowledge, discounted the veracity of history’s claims to a true time and proposed conceptions of temporality they believed to be emanating from the historical process itself (as they conceived it). The consequence of Halbwachs’s and Tosaka’s interventions was to deprivilege state archives and thus shifted the order of the Hegelian allegory symbolizing the conflict between Chronos, the god of Time, and Zeus, the god of politics who created state and hearth. In this struggle, Chronos, who inevitably devours his own, engulfing all in his passage, is ultimately dominated by Zeus, who creates the state, which in turn conquers time. Just as important is the state’s capacity to transform in history all that Mnemosyne—the goddess of memory—had been able to collect after the rampaging passage of time.
         25It is also worth mentioning that while Halbwachs codified the separation of history from memory and upheld the claims of the latter over the former (that is to say, the claims of time over space) the effort to rematerialize time—yet retain its qualitative character—by freeing it from an interiorized, psychological consciousness was not attempted in Europe or America, but Japan. Tosaka’s critique of what he called “borrowed time,”26referring to history’s reliance on conceptions of time from other disciplines—the physical sciences, but especially the inner time consciousness of phenomenology and even mythology—and his identification of the everyday (especially as lived by the worker) revealed the real source of historical time, the “mystery of~<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: The notion that brahman transcends the experience of bliss as its source might seem obvious to a Vedāntin. Why, then, would the pre‐Śaṅkara tradition interpret the Taittirīya text in a way that might occasion a serious misunderstanding of the nature of the religious path? And why would Śaṅkara preserve the arguments for this deficient interpretation in his
         Bhāṣya, giving them full rein before finally overturning their conclusion in a kind of commentarial appendix? As indicated above, the answer has to do with the different problematic underlying this earlier line of interpretation, namely, the Vedāntic repudiation of the Sāṃkhya concept ofpra
            dhāna. The influence of this preoccupation on the earlier reading of Taittirīya II is transparent in I.1.18. The mention of desire (kāma) in the Taittirīya text, “He desired (akāmayata), ‘Let me become many, let me be born,’” excludes the possibility of the bliss sheath being identified with insentientpra
            dhāna.100The citation ofBrahma‐sūtraI.1.5,īkṣiter nāśabdam, immediately after this argument makes it clear that for the early interpreters of theBrahma‐sūtra, I.1.12–19 stands in continuity with the rejection ofpra
            dhānaas the world cause in I.1.5. In the context of this concern with rejecting Sāṃkhya teaching, the identification of brahman with the bliss sheath makes perfect sense, for bliss is one of the manifestations of the sentience that the Upaniṣads affirm of the world cause.<br>

Abstract: The idea of truth in library classification systems can be interpreted to take place within analytical explorations of knowledge organization, information‐seeking behavior, and broader discussion about the nature of certainty, whereby classification systems provide “rules of procedure” that facilitate the discovery of knowledge [
            27]. As noted by Elaine Svenonius [28], the purpose of classification is to “bring like things together … based on one or more specified attributes” [28, p. 10]. Within this broad framework, interpretations of truth in practice can be found in Svenonius’s examination of accuracy in transcribing data. As she explains: “Truthfully transcribing how a document represents itself is necessary for the identification and communication of bibliographic information” [28, p. 71]. Truthful transcription of metadata is considered good practice because it ensures that descriptions of the same bibliographic entity are created identically by different individuals, thereby facilitating consistent searching and discovery among users.<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: To call the subsequent lexical effacement of the feminized hero in the final paragraph a displacement and condensation respectively—of maternal absence
         uponand thenwithinthe very identification of the marriageable male—is to begin suggesting, with the unconscious of Dickensian grammar caught out in this way, where attention itself might be caught up by such a disjuncture. Forunconsciousis just the word. One can only follow out the prose's diffusive lines of stress in and through the transferential recognitions of that analytic session called reading. By the invested give- and-take of such legibility, in this and many another fictional case, the psycholinguistic trace of elided desire is offered up to registration. It comes to us, as we bring our recognition to it, along the serial slippage between plot and its inscriptive medium, between the manifest propulsion of event and a subterranean impetus glimpsed on the run in the kinks of wording. Concerning the unrevealed mother, we can never be sure what Dickens meant to finesse or massage or avoid or foreclose or, alternately, what he himself as author may have entirely repressed in the psychodynamic of his narrative plotting inLittle Dorritfrom chapter plan to finished book. All we know is that hiswritingappears to be no more than half conscious of these operations—no more, but no less. It is this reciprocal remainder under the transferential analysis I am here calling narratography that keeps the legible textin playacross the more imperious s/pacings of plot.<br>

My soft‐transcendental answer, Proustian in nature, is that it goes, or more exactly it remains, where it should be in the first place, namely, in the organismic memory that mourning “injects in [her son’s] blood stream.” It is the embodied token of his self’s altruistic identification in the loved one.<br>

Author(s): Andrew Dudley<br>
Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Despite these oppositions, secularization and resacralization should be regarded as complementary phenomena that arose in response to the problem of a radically transcendent, hidden God. The studies under review, then, are of crucial importance, but their full significance requires a supplementary analysis. Novel conceptions of society, the nation, Scripture, and personhood followed from an intensification of divine transcendence, and, at the same time, necessitated a reworking of the immanent relations between worldly persons, institutions, and things. It was not merely that secularization, now understood by Bell and others as the translation of divine authority into a worldly register, entailed that the latter incorporate the properties and prerogatives once reserved for God alone. Enlightenment-era efforts to resacralize the self as an object of a totalizing force—situated either in the mystic divine or in a purely immanent, materialist conception of nature—suggest another dynamic at work: the closing of the chasm between the divine and terrestrial spheres and the identification of one with the other. Even if human effort was increasingly regarded as the source of one's understanding of the world, the humans undertaking this work had become newly alien to themselves, and in a manner that recalled the radical distance of the divine.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Abstract: And just as the play solicits sympathy with Faustus in its spectacle and its comedy, so does it invite pity for Faustus in its tragedy. Such pity emerges from a slightly different kind of theatrical identification, however. Rather than accompanying the spectator's recognition that a character shares his or her interests, pity may arise when the spectator recognizes the character's otherness, when he apprehends or infers that the character suffers inwardly in an extraordinary way. Yet in pity the spectator also identifies in some sense with the tragic character, for he feels psychic pain in his imagination of the character's suffering. For Levinas, for instance, pity, as an expression of the subject's irreducibly asymmetrical obligation to the other, is fundamental to ethics.
      34But inDoctor Faustus, pity has no salutary ethical or moral value; on the contrary, the play explicitly contrasts the quality of human pity to that of divine mercy, thereby fashioning pity for Faustus as an aesthetic response that undermines the spectator's faith in God. It is the old man who thus devalues tragic pity. After Helen leaves the stage for the first time, the old man tells Faustus that an “angel” hovers over his head “with a vial full of precious grace” to “pour” into his “soul” (5.1.54–56), and he urges Faustus to repent—to “break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears” (5.1.40)—warning him that he has endangered his inward soul “with such flagitious crimes of heinous sins / As no commiseration may expel / But mercy, Faustus, of thy Savior sweet, / Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt” (5.1.43–46). “Commiseration” is, of course, the contemporaneous word for the pity inspired by tragedy; Sidney uses it as such inThe Defense of Poesy.35The old man argues, then, that Faustus is no less damnable for being pitiful, yet his argument, orthodox as it may be, not only makes God seem somehow less compassionate than even the crudest member of the audience moved by Faustus's ~<br>

Abstract: The identification of the biblical condition with gonorrhea is only provisional. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that, against some claims to the contrary (e.g., Milgrom,
         Leviticus 1–16, 907), there is no reason to deny the awareness of venereal diseases in the ancient Near East. See now Scurlock and Andersen,Diagnoses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine, 88–97.<br>

Abstract: David Parkin identifies and endorses two points critical to my argument, namely, the methodological principle that “the boundaries of the positive are predicated on the definitional challenges of the negative,” and the recognition that “evil is existentially present even if not amenable to set identification.” He refers to my observation that he purposefully excluded witchcraft from themes treated in
         The Anthropology of Eviland accepts my rationale for examining it here. It just may be that when his volume appeared nearly 30 years ago witchcraft was too obvious a place to look for evil, whereas to me it appeared a useful topic to revisit, given current intellectual considerations concerning morality. Interestingly, once Parkin accepts witchcraft as exemplary of human evil, as a move to demystify and de-theologize the category, he himself takes the next step of reintroducing evil conceived supernaturally and how it displaces culpability. The questions of whether evil attacks humans or lies among humans, and of whether evil is other than human or an extension of the human, call into question the boundaries of humanity. Independently of whether morality is divinely ordained or whether religion and morality are conceived as coterminous, the space between human and nonhuman is one of both moral and religious ambiguity. Witches may be something less than human, spirits may be in some respects like people and in others like animals, djinn may be like people except made of fire and air while we are made of earth and water, and angels or devils inhabit a preternatural world somewhere between the natural and supernatural.<br>

Abstract: When Poor Tom rushes onstage, his wildness and weirdness are utterly astonishing. Lear, however, strives to close the gap between the stranger and himself by asserting an essential similarity. As if to blunt the force of Edgar’s alterity, Lear equates the beggar’s condition with his own.
      
            Though Kent objects that Poor Tom has no daughters, Lear is undeterred in his identification. He will not allow that Edgar’s situation might exceed his own: “Death, traitor! Nothing could have subdued nature / To such a lowness but his unkind daughters” (3.4.65–66). Lear’s approach is all wrong, and not just on points of fact. By comprehending Edgar’s suffering within the circumference of his own, Lear effectively denies Edgar’s difference and makes himself the model for all misfortune. Staged like this, Lear’s empathy looks a lot like narcissism.
               
         Didst thou give all to thy two daughters,
               And art thou come to this?
               · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 
               Has his daughters brought him to this pass?
               Couldst thou save nothing? Wouldst thou give ’em all?
               (3.4.47–48, 59–60)
            
            It is unseemly, and it does nothing to deliver Lear from the solitude of being that manifests itself in this play as madness. When Lear cozies up to Poor Tom as to a known quantity, his mental state precipitously declines. Before long, he is removing all his clothes—a sure sign of madness in Shakespeare’s day.31
         
            As a corrective, then, to the conventional view that32
         Learis all about empathy, we ought to acknowledge that though the king comes to think of others as of himself, this is not enough to heal him. Indeed, it is in a fit of fellow feeling that Lear strips himself naked and provides conclusive proof that he is mad.<br>

Abstract: For Scarry, metaphorical descriptions demonstrate a fundamental problem in the expression of pain. She identifies two particular types of metaphors that those in pain often use: one that specifies an “external agent” of the pain, as in “It feels like a hammer coming down on my spine”; and a second that specifies “bodily damage,” as in “It feels as if my arm is broken … and [the bone is] sticking through the skin.” Both types of metaphors are made visible in the works in
      The Pain Exhibit. The trouble with these images—of “weapon” and “wound”—is that they are not identical with pain but rather are used “associatively” to describe characteristics of an otherwise nonreferential experience. Such language is inherently unstable and “permits a break in the identification of the referent and thus a misidentification of the thing to which the attribute belongs.”
            In other words, if we move the agency of pain outside the body through an image like Robinson’s screwdriver, or locate pain in a wound that does not actually exist like the razor blade lacerations on Collen’s plaster foot, we risk separating the experience from the body who suffers through it. In the context of Scarry’s work—modern torture and warfare—this abstraction of pain from the real bodies involved can impede empathetic and humanitarian response to such atrocities.7<br>

Abstract: One of the striking things about this anticlimax to creation in the Akkadian tradition is the way the work of literary parallelism clarifies not only the structure acquired by the cosmos—the division into relative parts: the heavens above and the earth below, the god Apsû (the personification of fresh water, from the Sumerian AB.SU, whence the Greek
            abissos) and the goddess Mummu-Tiamat (the personification of salt water, from the AkkadianTiamtu, sea), and so forth—but also the way creation itself takes place via the word, since the literary parallelism very clearly equates “calling by name” and “creating.” The events of “naming” and “existing”—being determined by the accentuation of the word and entering upon existence as a discrete entity that separates out from the initial indifferentiation (Apsû/Tiamat)—are overlaid (the lexicon of “naming”—shuma zakaru,nabu, se’u, shima shimu—also has clear connotations of determination, delineation, identification, and separation). This is spelled out thematically, rather than formally, further on in the poem, when Marduk positively deploys his destructive and creative power in the face of the challenge from the other gods: “‘At a word from you, let this Constellation vanish! /At another command, let it be whole!’ // At awordfrom him, by hiscommand, the Constellationvanished. / And at anothercommand, the Constellation wasrestored. // When the gods, his fathers, saw thefruit of his word, / Joyfully they did homage: ‘Marduk is king!’” (emphasis mine).<br>

Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 2013<br>
Abstract: This paper seeks to bridge two aspects of Fronto's letters, erotics and rhetoric, by demonstrating that Fronto himself merges the two areas in his discourse with Marcus Aurelius about their relationship. Whereas some letters suggest an unequal relationship based on power, others encourage the identification of Fronto with Marcus. Fronto achieves this identification by structuring their relationship itself as a metaphor in which he and Marcus are equated and linked by epistolary bonds. I close by discussing why the epistolary genre in particular is an apt site for the merger of metaphor and love.<br>

Author(s): Selby Gary S.<br>
Abstract: Abstract:This essay argues that in 1 Thessalonians, Paul uses eschatological discourse—language about the end of hme—in order to evoke a symbolic world-view in which his readers become God's elect, living at the end of time and awaiting the sudden, imminent retum of Christ from heaven. This self-identification explains their present misfortunes, while at the sam.e time demanding that they fulfill the ethical and moral demands of the Christian faith. More broadly, this essay points to the role that eschatological discourse played within early Christianity in general, suggesting that it formed a central, paradigmatic drama which helped to define ontological and teleological reality for the movement's adherents.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Abstract: Eliade proposed to 'undertake to analyze the religious creativity of modern societies' in his "History of Religious Ideas" but never did so. In this paper I have attempted to suggest the general direction that his analysis would have taken -- the identification of the real with the actual is a religious valorization of contemporary humanity. This is not a generic shift from religion to non-religion but a belief of a religious nature which constitutes a novel departure from the traditional operations of the religious mind. It is accompanied by a refusal to countenance our creative involvement in the construction of reality. This Eliade labels 'modern' and 'historical'.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23254812<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): SLATMAN JENNY<br>
Abstract: In this paper, I explore the meaning of bodily integrity in disfiguring breast cancer. Bodily integrity is a normative principle precisely because it does not simply refer to actual physical or functional intactness. It rather indicates what should be regarded and respected as inviolable in vulnerable and damageable bodies. I will argue that this normative inviolability or wholeness can be based upon a person's embodied experience of wholeness. This phenomenological stance differs from the liberal view that identifies respect for integrity with respect for autonomy (resulting in an invalidation of bodily integrity's proper normative meaning), as well as from the view that bodily integrity is based upon ideologies of wholeness (which runs the risk of being disadvantageous to women). I propose that bodily integrity involves a process of identification between the experience of one's body as "Leib" and the experience of one's body as "Körper." If identification fails or is not possible, one's integrity is threatened. This idea of bodily integrity can support breast cancer patients and survivors in making decisions about possible corrective interventions. To implement this idea in oncology care, empirical-phenomenological research needs to establish how breast cancer patients express their embodied self-experiences.<br>

Abstract: Au Japon où se côtoient et s'imbriquent deux religions, le bouddhisme dont on connaît la richesse iconographique et le shintô, aniconique, l'identification très systématique des dieux et des bouddhas atteste de la porosité des catégories d'existants visibles ou invisibles. Si, pour certains, les bouddhas sont les formes originelles des dieux locaux, pour d'autres, ils n'en sont que les émanations. Cette incertitude théologique rend sujette à débats la présence des entités vénérées aussi bien que la nature de leur figuration, à la fois corps, représentation et substitut. Les spectacles populaires de marionnettes, des objets animés bons à brouiller les catégories du vivant et de l'inerte, laissent accroire qu'une forme de ruse rituelle, le simulacre, permet d'animer une statue inauthentique ou de transformer un corps d'homme vulgaire en un dieu vivant. La croyance en l'existence d'êtres surhumains se forge dans le rituel où substitué et substituant sont soigneusement confondus grâce à des mises en scène humaines ou divines qui dévoilent un monde où les possibilités de transformations seraient autres qu'ici-bas. In Japan, where two religions coexist and overlap, Buddhism known for its iconographic wealth and Shinto, aniconic, the very systematic identification of gods and Buddhas attests to the porosity of the categories of visible or invisible existing entities. If for some Buddhas are the original forms of local gods, for others they are just manifestations. This theological uncertainty allows us to debate the presence of worshiped entities as well as the nature of their representation, both body, representation and substitute. Popular puppet shows, animated objects blurring the categories of living and inert entities, let people believe that some form of ritual ruse, the simulacrum, can animate an inauthentic statue or transform a common man's body into a living god. Belief in the existence of supernatural beings is forged in the ritual in which the substituted and ~<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i23880984<br>
Date: 12 1, 2002<br>
Author(s): ANTHIAS FLOYA<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Author(s): Zékian Stéphane<br>
Abstract: Sur ces questions, la référence indispen-
sable est bien sûr Paul Ricœur, Temps et récits,
3 vol., Paris, Le Seuil, 1983-1985. Voir notam-
ment le chapitre « Vers une herméneutique de la
conscience historique », t. 3, p. 374-435. Evo-
quant Ulysse, la réflexion de F. Hartog entre en
résonance avec plusieurs préoccupations de la
littérature contemporaine. On peut penser en
effet au dernier et ultime récit de W. G. Sebald
(Austerlitz, traduit de l'allemand par Patrick
Gharbonneau, Arles, Actes Sud, 2002), dont le
personnage central, Jacques Austerlitz, parti à
la recherche de son identité et de ses racines,
doit bientôt affronter des traces muettes de lui-
même. Les photographies anciennes qu'il
retrouve s'offrent à lui comme des signes éteints :
elles suggèrent un lien, sans atteindre pourtant
cette familiarité qui permettrait de renouer les
temps. Le héros affronte ainsi sa propre histoire,
son inscription dans une durée par quoi l'iden-
tité s'altère : littéralement, devient autre. Durée
paradoxale, bien sûr, puisqu'elle assure la conti-
nuité du passé au présent dans le mouvement
même qui empêche l'identification des deux ins-
tants. « C'était moi, c'est moi » dit Ulysse : c'est
cette phrase qu'à sa suite, Austerlitz cherchera
à articuler, non sans ambiguïté. Par ailleurs,
insistant sur le « retour » comme sujet paradoxal
qui plonge subitement l'épopée dans une tem-
poralité intermédiaire (entre parole épique et
récit historique). Régimes d'historicité trouve éga-
lement un écho dans le dernier roman de Milan
Kundera, qui pointe ironiquement la mythologie
du Grand Retour, et la nostalgie considérée
comme valeur. Dans llgnorance (Gallimard,
2003), le lecteur est en effet projeté au-delà du
deuil : les larmes d'Ulysse sont séchées depuis
longtemps. L'altération est ici vécue et admise
comme un fait par des personnages qui parvien-
nent à vivre le présent comme autre chose que le
seul moment de deuil d'un passé perdu.<br>

à tous ses liens un à un, de se rendre libre par désinvestissement; dans la mélancolie, il en va
tout autrement. Une identification du moi avec l'objet perdu permet à la libido de poursuivre
son investissement dans l'intériorité : le moi devient ainsi par identification l'objet ambivalent
de son amour et de sa haine; la perte de l'objet est transformée en une perte dans l'ego et le
conflit entre l'ego et la personne aimée se poursuit à travers le nouveau clivage entre la faculté
critique de l'ego et l'ego lui-même affecté par l'identification » (p. 214). La nostalgie romantique
n'est-elle pas parente de la mélancolie selon la psychanalyse?<br>

Abstract: With the increased use of computers in research it can be tricky to determine where
the boundary hes between generative musical grammars and an IT approach to the resolution

(author-verification) or those used for musical composition itself. Two sources help us to si-
tuate musical grammars in a generic sense: Computer Music Journal, IX, no. 2, 1980, and the
Proceedings of the important conférence held in Modena in 1982 (Baroni and Callegari, eds,

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i24569478<br>
Date: 11 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Monrad Merete<br>
Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

Abstract: Le rapt d'enfants de disparus, nés en captivité ou séquestrés pendant les
violations de domicile et donnés à leurs propres tortionnaires ou aux familles
de ces derniers et, dans une moindre mesure, à d'autres « parents adoptifs », est
un crime contre l'humanité qui n'a pas de précédent dans l'histoire. En ce sens,
les Grands-mères de la place de Mai ont assumé la tâche immense, presque de
détective, de rechercher ces petits-enfants à qui le droit à l'identité fut bafoué.
Sur cinq cents enfants concernés, plus de quatre-vingt-dix ont récupéré leur
identité grâce aux techniques d'analyse de l'ADN les plus modernes. Certains
jeunes, avertis de cette recherche et soupçonnant qu'ils étaient concernés, se
sont volontairement rapprochés des Grands-mères, d'autres furent
intensivement recherchés et retrouvés à partir de certaines pistes. Il est arrivé
que des jeunes s'opposent à l'identification, mais une loi est récemment passée
qui oblige à la confrontation génétique lorsqu'il y a présomption.<br>

Abstract: Especially in connection with this 'before and after death' questions can be raised. Does
the soul emerge from the process of dying unchanged? I suggested that, considering the no-
longer-in-sin after death, this is unlikely. There is continuity and discontinuity. The question is
whether the discontinuity is so great that it threatens the identity of the soul as non-material
substance. Cooper would not go this far, because he seems to identify personal identity with the
existence of the soul. Such identification is questionable however, not only because in this way
the personal character of corporeality becomes a problem (the personification of the body is
then secondary since it is achieved only in the joining of the corporeal and the spiritual), it is
also questionable because human personhood ultimately is and remains a secret — a mysteiy
that permits no identification with whatever substance.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Winograd William B.<br>
Abstract: This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un análisis de la novela Una casa vacía (1996) del escritor chileno Carlos Cerda, basado en la identificación de elementos de imaginería gótica en distintos niveles de la obra. Se estudia el funcionamiento de estos elementos dentro del macro esencialmente realista de la obra, para intentar establecer los límites cruzados entre el testimonio, la historia oficial y sus metaforizaciones. La alegoría final que la obra novelesca construye en relación con la antigua casa de tortura y sus habitantes, se corresponde con el período final de la Dictadura Militar (1973-1989) y las prácticas de tortura realizadas por organismos de gobierno contra civiles. Sin embargo, también se trata de mostrar la dificultad del realismo testimonial para escribir una novela sobre la degradación y el sufrimiento de la sociedad chilena del período, sin caer en una ideología maniquea de la narración. This article is an analysis of Una casa vacía (1996), a novel written by the Chilean author Carlos Cerda. This analysis is based upon the identification of elements of the Gothic imaginery at different levels of this narrative. The functioning of these elements is studied within the basically realistic frame of the novel, in order to establish the permeable boundaries between testimonial narrative, the official history and its metaphorizations. The ultimate allegory that the novel builds around a former torture house and its inhabitants finds its correspondence with the final period of the Military Dictatorship (1973-1989) and the torture practices carried by Government Organizations against civilians. Nevertheless, this article tries to show the difficulty of testimonial realism in order to write a novel about the suffering and decadence of the Chilean society of the period, without succumbing to a Manichean concept of the narrative function.<br>

Abstract: This essay is a reply to Matthew Feldman's identification and advocacy (in SBT/A 16) of a methodological "partition" in Beckett studies. It argues that the 'critical tribunal' set up by his article may be contested on the grounds that: the advocated paradigm for research makes a contentious journey from science to literature; it dogmatically imposes restrictions on the range of literary critical interventions deemed to be of value; it employs a 'black box' approach to its own argument.<br>

Author(s): Banerjee Sanjoy<br>
Abstract: How does international interaction shape states' patterns of thought, emotion, and action? This paper examines the processes by which motives and practices feed each other in reproducing historical structures. An artificial intelligence model defines state-subjects as cultures combining special meanings that produce causal attribution, state self-identification, emotions, and action motives. These special meanings are built from subjective cultural categories describing social acts and group character of the self and others. Anger, pride, fear, and relief motivate action. A collection of such subject-cultures may produce a pattern of actions that reiterates the cultures. The model discriminates between those combinations of elements in special meanings which reproduce subjects and historical structures, and those which do not. The meanings discovered in such reproduction analysis can be validated by discourse analysis.<br>

Abstract: Here, we should beware of the English translation, which tends to reify the two Chinese
characters 仏教.Literally, they indicate “teachings [of the] Buddha,” or "Buddhist teachings，”
with a further step being their identification with "Buddhism." Like the concept of “religion”
that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century to translate a Western concept, there is a sub-
tle shift between the idea of "Buddhist teachings” and the further use of the same term to indi-
cate "Buddhism."<br>

Abstract: La stèle du Bronzo est gravée d'un oiseau "levé", en plein vol, la tête tournée vers l'extérieurs, superposé à un filon de quartz blanc; une crosse, également traitée en champlevé, lui barre le passage. En première lecture, une identification plausible du genre volatile semblait prévaloir et le colombidé emportait notre adhésion. Mais une analyse plus posée et un effort de déconstruction graphique du motif permettront cette fois de reprendre et d'affiner la reconnaissance, en décrivant les différents filtres autorisant tel ou tel rejet de catégorie ou d'espèce, pour ne conserver en dernier ressort que les meilleurs prétendants à la seule confrontation possible, celle qui oppose les corvidés aux colombidés. La représentation du Bronzo est en définitive équivalente en substance et en structure aux scènes figurées sur les stèles voisines dans lesquelles un phallus s'oppose qu tranchant d'une lame de hache (Mané Rutual), tandis qu'un cachalot affronte la coalition des animaux et des outils de l'homme (Table des Marchand). A "flushed" bird is engraved on the Bronzo stela, in full flight, its head turned to the exterior, superposed over a white quartz vein; a crook, equally treated in cut-away engraving, bars its passage. At a first reading, a plausible identification of the bird seemed to prevail and the Columbidae met with our approval. However, more deliberate analysis and an effort at the graphic deconstruction of the motif allows the identification to be reconsidered and improved, by describing the various filters authorising the rejection of such or such a category, finally preserving the best claimants to the only possible confrontation, opposing Corvidae to Columbidae. The Bronzo representation is equivalent in substance and in structure to the scenes on the neighbouring stelae where a phallus is opposed to the sharp edge of an axe blade (Mané Rutual), while a sperm-whale confronts the coalition of animals and human tools (Table des Marchand). However Bronzo is a ~<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Author(s): McDonald William C.<br>
Abstract: Hie vor dô wir kinder wâren by Der Wilde Alexander (fl. 1250) proceeds from the words of St. Paul: "Even so we, when we were children [nepioi], were in bondage under the elements of the world" (Galatians 4:3). Accordingly, the "Kindheitslied" is no nostalgic song of retrospection in the form of sacred, didactic allegory (a gloss is absent), but rather is an extended scriptural analogy addressing the change from the Old Law to the New. The words dô and nu (1,1 and 1,7) reflect New Testament rhetoric. The biblical echo in the opening line permits immediate identification; thus Alexander relies neither on progressive unveiling of his message nor on a language or ciphers. The "Kindheitslied" can be profitably discussed in conjunction with the body of literature on the encounter of Church and Synagogue.<br>

Abstract: Christian Holocaust scholars insist that historical atrocity should catalyze religious change. Many established Holocaust theologians presume that the antidote to anti-Judaism involves identifying an authentic version of Christian faith lacking moral blemish. However, recent responses tend to view the Bible and the Christian tradition as irreducibly ambiguous. These new responses foreground perpetrator perspectives and correlate developments in theological reflection with evolving public Holocaust representations. They are distinctive in advocating careful examination of biographical connections to the Holocaust, including family, religious, and national identification. In significant ways, emphasis on ambiguity in recent Christian Holocaust thought provides critical leverage on the redemptive tendencies of popular Holocaust remembrance in the United States.<br>

Abstract: The systematic relevance of the arguments Schopenhauer directs against Kant's categorical imperative has hardly been discussed in detail so far. As the difference between Kant's and Schopenhauer's moral philosophy amounts to the opposition between practical reason and sympathy, it is anything but surprising that it is reflected by Schopenhauer's objections. Schopenhauer tries to show that practical reason - be it in its pure or empirical form - is altogether incapable of furnishing a solid basis for ethics. To assess the import of this thesis, a detailed examination of the aspects of practical reason that provoke Schopenhauer's critique is necessary including: 1) the identification of morality and reason; 2) the moral value of maxims; 3) the categorical imperative; 4) the prescriptive character of Kant's approach; and 5) his ethico-theology. Although some of Schopenhauer's arguments are based on misunderstanding, his interpretation of the categorical imperative as an expression of rational egoism seems convincing. /// A relevância sistemática dos argumentos que Schopenhauer dirige contra a doutrina kantiana do Imperativo Categórico quase não tern sido objecto de discussão. O autor do presente artigo considera que tal como a diferença entre a filosofia moral de Kant e de Schopenhauer se reduz à oposição entre razão e simpatia, não é motivo de surpresa verificar que ela está reflectida nas objecções de Schopenhauer. Este, com efeito, tenta mostrar que a razão prática - seja isso na sua forma pura ou na sua forma empírica - é totalmente incapaz de fornecer uma base sólida para a ética. Em ordem a captar a importância desta tese, o artigo propõe um exame detalhado dos aspectos da razão prática que suscitam a crítica de Schopenhauer, entre os quais se inclui necessariamente: 1) a identificação de moralidade e razão; 2) o valor moral das máximas; 3) o imperativo categórico; 4) o carácter prescriptivo da abordagem kantiana; e 5) a sua teologia ética.

Abstract: La psychanalyse freudienne est de bout en bout interprétation ; Freud établit des règles pour l'interprétation, il donne une clé herméneutique, et ébranle et met en mouvement les interprétations existantes que l'homme donne de soi-même et du monde. D'autre part il est remarquable que l'oeuvre de Freud est inconnue et méconnue dans la littérature herméneutique. P. Ricoeur est le premier qui ait compris qu'on ne peut pas se passer de Freud comme interlocuteur lors de la discussion sur l'herméneutique. Freud fonctionne, selon Ricoeur, comme démystificateur. Il démasque les illusions. Une seconde lecture de Freud est la remise en question des intentions réductrices. Dans son essai sur Freud la réflexion, l'interprétation comprise comme réduction de l'illusion, et l'interprétation entendue comme restauration du sens constituent une unité dialectique. Mais schatten. Of hij echter van de echte wijsgerige intentie veel begrepen heeft kan men betwijfelen. Ricoeur ne parle jamais de l'acte psychanalytique ou du dialogue psychanalytique en tant que tel. C'est pour cette raison que la vraie portée de la découverte freudienne se perd probablement. Dans l'acte psychanalytique il se révèle que l'homme est situé dans un langage et dans un discours transindividuel. Un discours qui est en même temps présentation, objectivation, identification, apologie, provocation, frustration et aliénation. Le langage, selon Lacan, a une primauté sur le sujet parlant et le discours transindividuel est irréductible. La primauté du langage et du discours, considérée comme irréductible peut changer et éclairer d'une façon toute nouvelle les questions fondamentales de l'herméneutique actuelle.<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: À partir d'une enquête effectuée auprès d'élèves de Quatrième, Troisième, Seconde et Première, on propose un modèle intermédiaire d'appropriation de l'histoire. En utilisant les classificateurs expérimentés en sémantique cognitive, on peut ramener à deux grandes catégories cognitives, l'identification du texte de l'histoire : l'une de type événement-changement s'inscrit dans un schéma narratif, l'autre de type entité stable dans un intervalle temporel met en œuvre des processus de catégorisation. Les événements, concepts et entités de l'historien ne correspondent pas toujours aux modes de perception des élèves. Ces derniers procèdent par catégorisation naturelle en multipliant les analogies entre des périodes historiques différentes, en ancrant les informations nouvelles dans une pensée sociale. How do secondary school students get in contact with historical texts ? Examples drawn from an investigation are used to present identification processes as a change-event or as lasting entities in a time interval, analogical categorization processes and social thinking rooting.<br>

Abstract: Diversos trabajos han señalado còmo en contextos altamente represivos el surgimiento y la continuidad del activismo no se entienden sin la intervención de fuertes elementos subjetivos, afectivos y emocionales.Este artículo participa de este enfoque con un análisis longitudinal del activismo de la primera generación de anarquistas clandestinos bajo la dictadura franquista (1939-1975). Los resultados destacan la combinación de tres factores que ayudan a explicar el sostenimiento del activismo anarquista: i) la mediación de la esperanza en la percepción de oportunidades para la movilización; ii) la movilización estratégica de la indignación en el discurso dirigido a los potenciales apoyos y participantes; y iii) el fortalecimiento de la identificación ideológica con el movimiento gracias, paradójicamente, a la represión. Las fuentes incluyen diversos materiales de archivo y testimonios de activistas. Previous research has shown that in highly repressive contexts, the emergence and continuity of activism cannot be understood without considering the role of strong subjective, affective and emotional elements.Building on this approach, this article offers a longitudinal analysis of the activism of the first generation of clandestine anarchists under Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975). The results point towards a combination of three factors that help explain the maintenance of anarchist activism. These are: i) the role of hope in the perception of opportunities for mobilization; ii) the strategic mobilization of indignation in the discourse directed at potential supporters and participants; and iii) the strengthening of the ideological identification with the movement due, paradoxically, to the effects of repression. The sources used include a range of archival material as well as activists' memoirs.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte propose un examen de la figure d'Eva Perón, épouse du président populiste de l'Argentine, Juan Perón, comme icône de l'identité argentine. Elle est récupérée comme un espace d'identification inéluctable dans l'imaginaire politique national et la représentation que l'on se fait d'elle varie selon la conjoncture et les acteurs en jeu. L'« Evita populiste » incarne une image maternelle de protection des secteurs populaires, tandis que l'« Evita Montonera » et l'« Evita piquetera » dessinent les contours d'un profil révolutionnaire. Qu'en est-il alors de l'appropriation que fait la Présidente actuelle de l'Argentine, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner? Ce travail a comme but d'examiner la spécificité des différentes lectures du mythe et de montrer que loin d'avoir diminuée, l'importance de cette figure reste fondamentale dans les manières de faire encore aujourd'hui de la politique en Argentine. Este texto propone un análisis de la figura de Eva Perón, esposa del presidente populista de la Argentina, Juan Perón, como ícono de la identidad argentina.

Este trabajo tiene como objetivo examinar la especificidad de las diferentes lecturas del mito y mostrar que lejos de haberse disipado, la importancia de esta figura continua marcando la forma actual de hacer política en Argentina.<br>

Abstract: Se examina el corpus de documentos del Departamento de Extranjería del Registro Civil e Identificación de Antofagasta, entre los años 1900 y 1930, relativos a la presencia de argentinos en las localidades precordilleranas del interior de la región, así como en el núcleo Calama-Chuquicamata durante el auge del ciclo salitrero. La inmigración argentina se relacionó con la continuidad histórica de nexos sociales y comerciales en el área de la puna de Atacama. Los flujos de profesionales y oficios calificados se acomodaron en las actividades mineras y comerciales, mientras los no calificados en el ámbito agropecuario. Here, we present the corpus of documents kept by the Immigration Department and the Office of Civil Registry and Identification in Antofagasta, between 1900 and 1930, related to the presence of Argentines both in the towns in the Andean foothills and the Calama-Chuquicamata nucleus during the peak of the nitrate cycle. Argentine immigration was related to the historical continuity of social and commercial links in the Atacama area. The flow of professionals and those in specialized fields became involved in mining and commercial activities, while individuals in non-specialized jobs found work in agriculture and livestock.<br>

Abstract: This article suggests that by analyzing vernacular narratives of a community through a qualitative rhetoric approach, we can attempt to understand the social construction of community in unique ways. Vernacular narratives often operate independent of, and even in opposition to, formal definitions put forward in official rhetorics about a particular community. I analyze a collection of vernacular narratives about a Rocky Mountain resort community to explore how a particular group of "locals" make sense of their highly transient community. By discussing how narratives of personal experience can translate into both collective conceptions of community and individual processes of identification, I seek to reveal how both vernacular and formal narratives of community formation can expose and reveal the taken-for-granted ways in which a particular "community" may (in)advertently be open (or closed) to changing as its members change.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates the role of conversion in character reformation. It begins by exploring the initial formation of character in infancy and childhood, as well as challenges to the initial formation of character in adulthood. It then delineates the role ofconversion in character reformation by showing that an individual's encounter with a selftranscending conceptual universe may alter his or her self-identification. This alteration may be expressed as the individual's capacity to "tell a new story" about him or herself. This article argues that a shift in self-identification and self-narration lies at the heart of a reformation of character.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: Largely due to Benveniste's dismissal ("Language in Freudian Theory," 1951), Freud's review essay of the philologist Karl Abel's "Über den Gegensinn der Urworte" ("On the Antithetical Sense of Primary Words") has been ignored or slighted by most critics of Freud's thought, even those influenced by Lacan's linguistic emphasis. Nonetheless, the essay on "primary antithetical meaning" (Ur-worte) should be of great importance for psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic approaches to art, for it explicitly addresses Freud's persistent identification of the unconscious with antithetical modes of thought. Benveniste's positivist dismissal is relevant to psychoanalysis in general (Freud's theories of bisexuality, Lutschen, and castration fear) and psychoanalytic studies of art in particular (Freud's essays on the "uncanny" in E. T. A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Hebbel's "Judith und Holofernes," Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, and so on.).<br>

Abstract: The present-day global culture challenges First-World theologians to coalesce with Third-World theologians. Such an enterprise is conditioned by the identification of commonalities in theological inquiry. Hermeneutics of the Bible, and especially of the New Testament, is an important common ground for 'traditional theology' and 'contextual theology' alike. This paper, however, argues that there is a foundational reason why the historical Jesus and not the canon should be seen as the common ground for the engagement by First-World as well as Third-World theologians. This argument relates to the epistemic status of the canon in liberation theology. The canon originated during the time when the horticultural society shifted to an agrarian one. This shift was accompanied by, among other things, the process of urbanisation and the increase of inequality and of the scarcity of resources. Our memory of the historical Jesus tradition keeps us in touch with Jesus' emancipatory living during these circumstances—an emancipatory living that unmasks the hegemony that could be embedded in the canon.<br>

Abstract: Serge Lifar built his career during the 1930s, a decade crucial to understanding his 'années noires'-or 'black years', as the French historian Henry Rousso called the period of the German occupation of Paris (1940—1944). Lifar's powerful and respected position at the Paris Opéra, the social connections he had built and maintained and the psychological impact of exile: all these elements help clarify Lifar's accommodating attitude towards the German occupants of his adopted city. During the 1930s Lifar came to be accepted in French intellectual society as the 'heir' of Serge Diaghilev. Through his publications he made a powerful contribution to the process by which Diaghilev's Ballets Russes assumed its paramount position in the development of modern ballet, a process set in motion by the impresario himself. Lifar played this role chiefly in France. In the English-speaking world, where relatively few of his books appeared in translation, other writers served to canonise the Diaghilev endeavour, albeit for somewhat different ends. A list of Lifar's publications in Russian and other languages (French above all) displays the growing influence of his actions and authority, the power of his connections (inherited primarily from Diaghilev), and his relentless will to overcome the problems of emigration as he secured not only success as a dancer and choreograph but also a public reputation as an intellectual. The recent discovery of new evidence has led to the identification of the respected Pushkin authority Modeste Hofmann as the writer whose unacknowledged work enabled Lifar to establish himself as an historian. This evidence, provided by Hofmann's grandsons André and Vladimir Hofmann, raises serious questions about the authority of Lifar's books. An interplay of subjective relationships is woven into the texture of these narratives in which survival and ambition, a paternal attitude and filial respect, exist in constant tension. Neither the making of these books nor the~<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the paths formed by the lives of four workers in nineteenth century France as a way of focusing on the problem of the relationship between individual life experience and the surrounding environment. The extremely rich biographical material contained in the main source used makes it possible to bring out the total identification between these two terms, which are usually seen as separate and as polar opposites. Individuals are profoundly shaped by the way they are embedded in a social milieu. And this milieu teems, beats and changes together with the individual.<br>

Issue: i40172767<br>
Date: 4 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: Alors que le Quatrième Évangile rapportait dialogues et symboles à la communication de la Révélation, la théologie contemporaine les renvoie souvent à une altérité constitutive de toute éthique. Partant de cet écart, irréductible à un simple renversement, l'article cherche à montrer comment le dialogisme et le symbolisme, grâce à leur dissemblance, demeurent aussi essentiels l'un que l'autre à l'accueil de l'Évangile, de la Révélation, du Salut. L'identification du croyant passe aussi bien par un dialogue né d'une séparation que par un symbole ordonné à un rassemblement. Pour parvenir à cette conclusion, l'article doit d'abord définir les conditions requises pour que chacune des deux formations signifiantes ouvre à la fois à un monde et à une communauté : un être et un agir nouveaux. While the Fourth Gospel draws upon dialogues and symbols for the communication of revelation, contemporary theology often relegates them to an otherness constitutive of any ethic. Beginning with this rupture, irreducible to a simple reversal, this paper seeks to show how dialogue and symbolism, thanks to their dissimilarity, remain so essential to each other for the reception of the Gospel, of revelation, of salvation. The identification of the believer passes just as well through a dialogue born of a separation as by a symbol ordered to a gathering. In order to arrive at this conclusion, this paper assumes the task of defining the conditions necessary for each of the two significant formations to open upon a world and a community: a new being and act.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: A detailed narrative performed by a Gros Ventre elder is analyzed for its significance in the construction of cultural identity. In the context of these analyses, it is argued that narrative performance can be central to the active construction of cultural identity for individuals engaged in social interaction. In the present instance, certain performative features of the narrative involve a discursive identification by the narrator with the narrative protagonist that affords a personal resolution of a cultural crisis-in-meaning. Finally, this discursive identification by the narrator results in the re-creation of narrative events that involve the audience as participants in ways that powerfully impact the cultural identities they too will construct.<br>

Abstract: On the face of it, the legacy of the 1798 rebellion in the northeastern Irish counties of Antrim and Down seems to be a paradigmatic case of “collective amnesia.” Over the course of the long nineteenth century, growing identification of the Protestants of the area with unionism, loyalism and Orangeism, fortified through opposition to the rise of nationalism amongst Catholics, encouraged public effacement of discomforting memories of the mass participation of Protestants, in particular Presbyterians, in republican insurrection. However, the uncovering of a “hidden” (or perhaps relatively low-profile) popular historiography grounded in oral traditions reveals continuous obsessive, though characteristically ambivalent, local preoccupation with remembrance of the rebellion. Acknowledging that forgetting is not the antithesis, but an integral component, of memory, this case study of what appears to be an Ulster
         lieu d'oubliconceptualizes “social forgetting” as the outcome of multi-layered relationships between oblivion and remembering.<br>

Abstract: The long never-ending party, from the reader's perspective, is thus a result of narrative strategies. The vagueness of such an atemporal party facilitates possibilities of reader associations with their own biographical past and is therefore important in heightening the emotional content of the textual hyper-memory. The fact that these parties take place during the summer further encourages nostalgic identification since summer is often linked to our own nostalgic memories. One technique that serves to emphasize the feeling of a long, never-ending party (the party of a lifetime) is Fitzgerald's use of
         iterative frequency, or more specificallypseudo-iterative frequency. Iterative frequency involves referring to narrating events as if they occurred more than once. Instead of relating to an event as “happened,” Fitzgerald says, it “used to happen.” Pseudo-iterative frequency occurs when the detailed description of an event appears to be not completely truthfully presented.
               In chapters 1 and 2 the frequency is7
            singulativein that what is told once in the narrative also happens once in the story.
               However, in the beginning of the third chapter, Fitzgerald departs from this classic narrative strategy and starts telling once in the narrative what happens several times in story time.8
            
               There was not music from Gatsby's house once, but “through the summer nights” (39). Before Nick arrives at Gatsby's party, Nick briefly summarizes all parties of the summer. That passage is a cavalcade of events and experiences as these illustrative fragments show: “In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and champagne and the stars, … [o]n week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, … [and e]very Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in ~<br>

Abstract: The title of Jabbeh Wesley's fourth collection of poetry,
         Where the Road Turns, is a subtle allusion to Wole Soyinka's1965play,The Road, and Ben Okri's1991Booker Prize–winning novel,The Famished Road. These two books explore the riches of Yoruba mythology in order to shed light on the African condition. The characters in Soyinka's play live on the road and make their living from what the road has to offer. Critics have pointed out the absurdist elements in Soyinka's conception of the road as a metaphor for Africa's instability, especially in the play's parallel with Samuel Beckett'sWaiting for Godot. What is said ofThe Roadapplies to Jabbeh Wesley'sWhere the Road Turns. Aided by the picture of the winding dirt road on the cover and at the beginning of each of the book's four sections, Jabbeh Wesley reminds us of the twisting road of Africa's existential journeys. The eponymous poem itself is representative of the poetry of attention:
               The detailed description of the place where a lonely speaker waits enables us to see what the speaker sees: a crumbling world. We are even more troubled by the fact that the speaker sees a parallel between him or her and the road: “Potholes have taken over my life” just as they have taken over the road. This self-identification with the road is to be understood as a lamentation for the conditions of the speaker's life and not as romanticizing the rural life of Africa. But little romanticizing is possible given that the speaker waits in the manner that reminds one of Samuel Beckett's remarkable characters, Pozzo and Lucky, inI'm right here on the road, in the open

Abstract: Around the world, protesters held signs and wore buttons saying, “I am Troy Davis.” But what does it mean to say, “I am Troy Davis”? Does this identification with Davis suggest that like him, I am innocent or that like me, he is? Or that if the state executes him, it executes me or if it doesn't execute me, it shouldn't execute him? What does it mean for these protesters around the world, most of them free from prison, most of them white and middle class, to identify with Davis, a condemned black man, raised in poverty, who spent twenty years, half of his life, on death row waiting to be executed? Doesn't this also, at least implicitly, say that I am the victim of the death penalty rather than the perpetrator? After all, the protesters were not holding signs saying, “I am Troy Davis's executioner,” which they could have done, given that here, and even in France where the death penalty has been abolished since 1981, polls show that most people still favor it. And no one was holding signs saying, “I am Lawrence Brewer.” Even though the fact that we continue to live in a racist country is undeniable, from racist comments directed at President Obama from the highest level of elected officials, to the staggering statistics that show that by far most of the people in prison and on death row are African American, to continued economic inequities reported just recently that put the median income for black households at $31,784, well below that of whites (Pear
      2011). The toxic combination of economic and social racism creates another type of lethal injection that, in various ways, is killing some people while benefiting others.<br>

Abstract: Of course, it is obvious that we come to know “persons” (or “personal I's”) by a process of comparison, that is, we understand persons not merely as what “I” refers to but as what I's have, what Husserl would call their “habitualities.” That is, we refer to them as beings in the world with others. In this respect knowing persons is indeed a matter of an identification of someone by
            per accidens individuation. The distinguishing properties that single me out for myself and for you in terms of bodily shape, species or kind, face, psychical and moral traits, gender, profession, autobiography, ethnicity, nationality, locality, place in time, and so on and so forth are a matter of individuationper accidensor of relating me or the other person to what is other than me or other than she or he. Yet, if we may consider the hypothesis that there is a sense in which what “I” refers to is not a mere bundle or constellation of properties (which in principle is repeatable), we may entertain a sense in which what/whom “I” refers to is nonsortal—nonpropertied—and this may give us reason to pause in thinking ofpersonsimply as a sortal term.<br>

Abstract: Our third plenary session in 2013 was a new part of the program, the Co-director's Address. Modeled somewhat loosely on the APA Presidential Address, this session was designed to offer the outgoing co-director the chance to speak to the whole membership either about his or her own work or about a reflection on the state of the discipline. Anthony Steinbock, as outgoing co-director, chose the latter approach for his address, though his article, “SPEP and the Continental Divide,” clearly shows that the question of the identity and orientation of SPEP as an organization is as much philosophical as it is practical. Tracing distinct phases in the history of SPEP, Steinbock argues that SPEP's distinctive orientation is its openness to experience. This openness to experience is, of course, central to the methodology of phenomenology, but over the years maintaining this orientation has also pushed SPEP to be open to new styles and currents of thought that go beyond phenomenology. To be sure, this has at times been a conflictual process, as Steinbock recounts, but it has also been one that remains true to SPEP's core animating impulse. However, Steinbock also maintains that this fundamental internal openness and rootedness in experience compels us to resist the strict and dogmatic identification of SPEP with “continental philosophy,” especially where this is understood as the Other of “analytic philosophy.”<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: This paper presents the background, findings, and implications of a new line of research on the technical identification of linguistic metaphor. Inspired by the cognitive-linguistic approach to metaphor launched by Lakoff and Johnson, a new theoretical framework and operational definition has been developed for the identification of metaphorical expressions in authentic discourse. The paper presents a brief report of two reliability studies of the first stage of the approach, and spells out how it may be applied in linguistic, stylistic and rhetorical text analysis with reference to a poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson.<br>

Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Abstract: The identification of orthodox modern architecture with Utopia, and by convenient extension with the presumed certain failure of both, is ultimately self-serving for an architectural profession in need of justification for its move toward any variety of stylistic postmodernisms in tandem with the discipline's abnegation of social responsibility, addressed by Bristol in the following:
         
               Bristol's observation that it was self-serving of architects and critics to pin the cause of building failure on those aspects of modernist design they disliked is indeed valuable. However, it also reveals how the genuine social agenda of twentieth-century modern architecture was rejected on the basis of taste, arguably justified by associating modernist architecture with Utopia and Utopia with failure. Emphasis on this helps to highlight how typical recollections of the crisis of Utopia in architecture and its causes (as told by Vidler, for example) conform to convention above all else. But such stories actually raise a more important question: How utopian—in general—was twentieth-century modern architecture anyway?The two most central critiques of the design of Pruitt-Igoe have come from successor movements to High Modernism: Postmodernism, and environment and behavior…. Pruitt-Igoe provides a convenient embodiment of all the alleged failings of Modernism…. Proponents of these new approaches attribute the problems of public housing to architectural failure, and propose as a solution a new approach to design. They do not in any significant way acknowledge the political-economic and social context for the failure of Pruitt-Igoe…. Pruitt-Igoe was shaped by … strategies … that did not emanate from the architects, but rather from the system in which they practice. The Pruitt-Igoe myth … not only inflates the power of the architect to effect social change, … it masks the extent to which the profession is implicated, inextricably, in structures and practices that it ~<br>
