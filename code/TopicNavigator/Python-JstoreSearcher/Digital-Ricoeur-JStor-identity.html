  CHAPTER 10  Discerning Skills: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctt1w76ttq">Exploring Jesuit Distinctiveness</a><br>
  Author(s) Casalini Cristiano<br>
  Abstract: The ability to examine talents is one of the key features that continue to distinguish the Jesuits in a large number of fields today. The mission statements of many educative institutions run by the Society all around the world, such as schools and universities, insist on the cultivation of students’ skills and talents as a hallmark of their excellence. Yet, this characteristic goes beyond the boundaries of the ministry of education, for it involves many other tenets of the Jesuit identity.<br>

  Chapter Four  The Superchurch Revealed from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Fundamentalism is largely defined by narratives of confrontation with and marginalization within the larger social landscape. To be at rest or at peace is incompatible with Fundamentalist identity because the Fundamentalist church must have enemies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that Fundamentalist narratives frequently highlight the alienation of believers from the world they inhabit and the enemies the church must overcome. Arguably most prominent among these narratives are those connected to the apocalypse—the imagined final conflict between Fundamentalist believers and their enemies culminating in the triumphant return of Christ to ensure believers’ victory.

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt14bs0wp">Superchurch</a><br>
  Abstract: Fundamentalism is, at its essence, a church movement. By this I mean, as we have explored throughout this study, that Fundamentalist counterpublicity is intimately intertwined with narratives about the survival and status of the Fundamentalist church, a universal idealization of local believing communities. This idealization, in turn, conflates political and spiritual, public and private concerns in Fundamentalist rhetoric. The church marks the boundaries and exclusions of Fundamentalist identity, yet it also builds bridges between private belief and public action. It is in defense and propagation of the Fundamentalist church and the ideal of revivalism that the local church finds its<br>

  Book Title: Enigmas of Sacrifice-A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cormack W. J. Mc<br>
  Abstract: Enigmas of Sacrifice: A Critique of Joseph M. Plunkett and the Dublin Insurrection of 1916is the first critical study of the religious poet and militarist Joseph M. Plunkett, who was executed with the other leaders of the Dublin insurrection of 1916. Through Plunkett the author gains access to areas of nationalist thought that were more often assumed or repressed than publicly formulated.In this eye-opening book, W. J. Mc Cormack explores and analyzes Plunkett's brief life, work, and influence, beginning with his wealthy but dysfunctional family, irregular Jesuit education, and self-canceling sexuality. Mc Cormack continues through Plunkett's active phase when amateur theatricals and a magazine editorship brought him into the emergent neonationalist discourse of early twentieth-century Ireland. Finally, the author arrives at Holy Week 1916, when Plunkett masterminded the forgery of official documentation in order to provoke and justify the insurrection he planned. Mc Cormack analyzes Plunkett's significant texts and provides context through critical perspectives on his milieu.Enigmas of Sacrificeis unique in its effort to understand a major figure of Irish nationalism in terms that reach beyond political identity.<br>

  Instrumental and Constitutive Rhetoric in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: Almost thirty years ago, in an essay devoted to the
                  Autobiography of Malcolm X, Thomas Benson commented that rhetoric is, among other things, a way of constituting the self within a scene composed of “exigencies, constraints, others and the self,” and it is also a resource for “exercising control over self, others, and by extension the scene.”¹ Thus, Benson assigns rhetoric a dual function. It is simultaneously generative and instrumental, since it helps to constitute the identity of self, other, and scene, while it also pulls these identities within the orbit of situated interests. Moreover, once this duality is acknowledged,<br>

  Book Title: To Become an American-Immigrants and Americanization Campaigns of the Early Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hahner Leslie A.<br>
  Abstract: Pledging allegiance, singing the "Star-Spangled Banner," wearing a flag pin-these are all markers of modern patriotism, emblems that announce the devotion of American citizens. Most of these nationalistic performances were formulized during the early twentieth century and driven to new heights by the panic surrounding national identity during World War I. In
      To Become an AmericanLeslie A. Hahner argues that, in part, the Americanization movement engendered the transformation of patriotism during this period. Americanization was a massive campaign designed to fashion immigrants into perfect Americans-those who were loyal in word, deed, and heart. The larger outcome of this widespread movement was a dramatic shift in the nation's understanding of Americanism. Employing a rhetorical lens to analyze the visual and aesthetic practices of Americanization, Hahner contends that Americanization not only tutored students in the practices of citizenship but also created a normative visual metric that modified how Americans would come to understand, interpret, and judge their own patriotism and that of others.<br>

  CHAPTER ONE  Public Culture and the Americanization of Immigrants from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1tqx76n">To Become an American</a><br>
  Abstract: At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States faced one of the most dramatic transformations to its national identity. From the 1890s to the 1920s, nearly 23 million immigrants, largely from Europe, would constitute what Mirel deems “one of the largest migrations in human history.”¹ While the United States had long been a nation of immigrants, the vast numbers of arrivals from Southern and Eastern Europe presented a significant shift from previous generations. For some, this momentous change was cause for disapprobation. Leonard Dinnerstein and David Reimers explain that, often fleeing “horrendous conditions” of poverty, immigrants came with<br>

  Henry Kissinger: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt5q8">Post-Realism</a><br>
  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: One consequence of realism being deeply embedded in Western culture is that it can operate effectively in fragments. The entire code can be activated any time we are reminded, e.g., that people are by nature self-interested, that law is useless without enforcement, or that testaments of common ideals are mere rhetoric. As we accept these and similar nostrums, we enter a world of states competing for power, experts capable of calculating advantages, and idealists and other amateurs counseling folly. As these beliefs cohere, they shape our attitudes, our sensitivities (or lack of them), and our political identity.<br>

  Abstract: The Arabs of Palestine maintained a strong communal identification with the land of Palestine and Jerusalem for many centuries, an expression that took a nationalist form in the early twentieth century.¹ Before 1881, there was no need for a distinct “Palestinian” identity or nation. From 1514 to the end of World War I, the Arab residents of Palestine saw themselves as members of a vast Arab nation, as residents of the three local districts of southern Syria, as Moslem or Christian, and primarily as members of village and familial units.² When the conflict with the Zionists became intense and the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt7zt60k">Shared Land/Conflicting Identity</a><br>
  Abstract: In chapter 4, we described the movement of the Palestinian people from a symbol system based to varying degrees on Arab, Islamic, and nationalist impulses toward a Palestinian Arab identity and movement rooted in myth. By 1937, the Palestinians had developed a symbol system that was based on ideological and mythic foundations that collapsed the scene (Palestine) and the agent (the Palestinian Arabs) into a consubstantiation. In this chapter, we examine the trajectory of Palestinian symbol use from the 1940s to 1960s.<br>

  Book Title: Nosotros-A Study of Everyday Meanings in Hispano New Mexico<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  14  POSTCOLONIALITY AS THE AFTERMATH OF TERROR AMONG VIETNAMESE REFUGEES from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pn9nx">Postcolonial Disorders</a><br>
  Author(s) Hollifield Michael<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we examine the problem of subjectivity as a transformation of lived experience in the wake of civil warfare and formation of the postcolonial nation-state. The specific terms of subjective alteration—collectively imprinted as a clash of political ethos¹ and personally imprinted as a shattering of identity and sentiment—are considered in relation to a culturally produced anguish in the aftermath of a conflict. Our ethnographic illustration of this process is the well-known case of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.² Prior to this political formation in 1975, multiparty warfare was waged throughout a fractured nation, as anticommunist armies<br>

  Abstract: Not so long ago the question would never have come up. Musicology was self-validating. It was grounded in a fixed conception of Western identity that it also helped perpetuate. Like the music it studied, primarily Western art music, it served the values of the humanistic tradition embodied in both the modern university and the high culture of a great civilization. It accumulated knowledge for deposit in a stable cultural archive that could support continuities of practice and understanding across time. It often debated its methods but rarely critiqued or interpreted the uses to which<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pnztv">After the Massacre</a><br>
  Abstract: The moral identity of mass village war death was ambivalent. It shifted between tragic and heroic, as illustrated by the Ha Gia mass reburial described in the previous chapter. Finding a place for the identity of an individual victim was also uncertain: some believed it should be in the ancestral memorial, whereas some chose its structural opposite. In preparing for a domestic ritual, people imagined that ancestors who experienced tragic death were hesitating between the ancestral shrine and the shrine for ghosts. The memory of mass civilian deaths created relationships with the domain of political hero worship as well as<br>

  Book Title: Jewish Identities-Nationalism, Racism, and Utopianism in Twentieth-Century Music<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Móricz Klára<br>
  Abstract: Jewish Identitiesmounts a formidable challenge to prevailing essentialist assumptions about "Jewish music," which maintain that ethnic groups, nations, or religious communities possess an essence that must manifest itself in art created by members of that group. Klára Móricz scrutinizes concepts of Jewish identity and reorders ideas about twentieth-century "Jewish music" in three case studies: first, Russian Jewish composers of the first two decades of the twentieth century; second, the Swiss American Ernest Bloch; and third, Arnold Schoenberg. Examining these composers in the context of emerging Jewish nationalism, widespread racial theories, and utopian tendencies in modernist art and twentieth-century politics, Móricz describes a trajectory from paradigmatic nationalist techniques, through assumptions about the unintended presence of racial essences, to an abstract notion of Judaism.<br>

  Author(s) BEINER RONALD<br>
  Abstract: The reflections that follow are a response to Catherine Zuckert’s interesting and provocative book,
                  Postmodern Platos.¹ The premise of the book is that there is a widely perceived crisis in the status and identity of Western philosophy, and leading thinkers since Nietzsche have felt obliged to return to the origins of philosophy in Plato in order to clarify what philosophy means and what it might continue to mean in the light of this crisis. In addition to Nietzsche, Zuckert examines four other thinkers—Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Leo Strauss, and Jacques Derrida—who share the conviction that Plato must be confronted<br>

  CHAPTER THREE  Writing the New American (Re)Public: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppdsm">Imaginary Communities</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter focuses on the indispensable role that, as Homi K. Bhabha suggests, “forgetting” plays in the construction of national subjectivity: “Being obliged to forget becomes the basis for remembering the nation, peopling it anew, imagining the possibility of other contending and liberating forms of cultural identification.”¹ Most of the classical ideologues of nationalism assert that the nation is a form of collective identity grounded in a shared sense of the past. Ernest Renan, for example, maintains in his influential 1882 lecture, “
                  Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?” (the subject of Bhabha’s comments as well), that two things constitute the “soul or spirit”<br>

  Abstract: This chapter addresses the intersection of colonialism, nationalism, and language, in particular, it analyzes how the construction of communities in a colonial context was mediated by ideas about language. I show how debates surrounding the establishment of an educational system and educational language policy in colonial Mauritius became a privileged site for contesting hegemonic claims in the form of negotiating the relationships of different groups in a colonial plantation setting. Conflicting approaches to language in education also informed debates about the role and significance of Indo-Mauritians in ascribing an identity to Mauritius with its lack of a precolonial population.At the<br>

  2  Essentialist and Normative Approaches from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppt8r">Studying Global Pentecostalism</a><br>
  Author(s) Droogers André<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter the role of essentialist and normative elements in the study of Pentecostalism is discussed. These elements are part of any academic effort. In studying Pentecostalism, essentialist and normative tendencies may also stem from the identity of Pentecostalism itself and from its perception by others. Any scholar studying this form of Christianity must therefore reflect on them, especially when interdisciplinary work is proposed. The overview given in this chapter serves to raise scholarly awareness of the pitfalls connected with essentialist and normative approaches. Yet both essentialist and normative tendencies can be shown to have a challenging, useful side<br>

  Abstract: To turn to the seventeenth century is to plunge into a turbulent world in which alchemy vied with physics, theology with philosophy, politics with religion, nations with each other, individuals with their anguished souls. No single treatment can do justice to this multifarious period of human history. We can, however, pick our way through it by attending to an assortment of figures who occupied themselves expressly with questions of place and space: Gassendi, Newton, Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz. Each of these thinkers—with the exception of Locke—was also a prominent scientist, and this double identity is no accident. To<br>

  Book Title: Controlling Contested Places-Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Shepardson Christine<br>
  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing rival-controlled areas as morally and physically dangerous, leaders in late antiquity fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it.
      Controlling Contested Placesmaps the city of Antioch (Antakya, Turkey) through the topographically sensitive vocabulary of cultural geography, demonstrating the critical role played by physical and rhetorical spatial contests during the tumultuous fourth century. Paying close attention to the manipulation of physical places, Christine Shepardson exposes some of the powerful forces that structured the development of religious orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the late Roman Empire.Theological claims and political support were not the only significant factors in determining which Christian communities gained authority around the Empire. Rather, Antioch's urban and rural places, far from being an inert backdrop against which events transpired, were ever-shifting sites of, and tools for, the negotiation of power, authority, and religious identity. This book traces the ways in which leaders like John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Libanius encouraged their audiences to modify their daily behaviors and transform their interpretation of the world (and landscape) around them. Shepardson argues that examples from Antioch were echoed around the Mediterranean world, and similar types of physical and rhetorical manipulations continue to shape the politics of identity and perceptions of religious orthodoxy to this day.<br>

  4  Transformative Transgressions: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt5vjzxb">Controlling Contested Places</a><br>
  Abstract: John Chrysostom strongly tied religious identity to Antioch’s physical places, and this is true also of the distinction that he made between the rural space around the city and the urban space within its walls. Although scholars have demonstrated that geographical boundaries are often more permeable than rhetorical descriptions of them allow,¹ boundaries nevertheless ideologically separate places from one another, distinguishing one side from the other in ways that accumulate cultural significance.² It should, therefore, come as no surprise when rhetorical descriptions of mass boundary crossings depict them as transforming the places on either side, as those who are seen<br>

  5  Mapping a Textured Landscape: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt5vjzxb">Controlling Contested Places</a><br>
  Abstract: Beyond church buildings and synagogues, Antioch’s urban and rural landscape was populated by a variety of smaller places of religious ritual, from a host of temples of all sizes to a growing number of Christian martyr shrines scattered across the landscape. Also, Christian ascetics increasingly settled in the surrounding region, their live bodies drawing pilgrims to them in ways similar to the relics of earlier saints.¹ Like Libanius’s classrooms, the locations of Babylas’s relics, churches, and synagogues, these temples, shrines, and saints (living and dead) also shaped topography and identity within Antioch’s
                  territorium,particularly through the ways in which Libanius,<br>

  Author(s) Poiana Peter<br>
  Abstract: The notion of framing is one that has emerged as a key factor in current investigations into representations of culture. In the disciplinary area of French Studies, framing is understood as collective and individual rules of identity construction that are based upon a combination of modes of visual production, past and present narratives, and discourses of knowledge and power. The present volume will pursue the question of framing in all three areas.<br>

  Author(s) Buglioni Chiara Maria<br>
  Abstract: No other discipline within the humanities has had to struggle with its own interdisciplinary character as much as theater research in Europe. The fathers of the new-born scholarship
                     Theaterwissenschaftwere mainly concerned with distinguishing theater from other forms of art and with asserting its right as an independent field of enquiry. The need to define a specific methodological approach, however, was not taken into account. This initial lack in the creation of the scientific discipline has influenced the controversial development of theater studies and has caused frequent identity crises.<br>

  Abstract: The introduction of the recording device at the beginning of the twentieth century not only marked a major transition in communication technology, but also paved the way for a revaluation of the oral account in Western historiography. With the rise of early civilizations and the introduction of writing tools it had lost its central role in the transfer of meaning and identity. Centuries later, the spread of literacy and the invention of the printing press stimulated the consolidation and appreciation of historical sources in textual form. Given the weight of this strong focus on text, the invention of a device<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  7  Development and Continuity from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt12878jm">In Defense of Doctrine</a><br>
  Abstract: The most critical issue for any model of doctrinal development is the question of doctrinal continuity. Can doctrines
                     develop, grow, orprogresswithout compromising their fidelity to “the faith once delivered unto the saints” (Jude 3)? Can there be maintained identity between New Testament teachings and later doctrinal formulations that utilize very different conceptual frameworks? Most importantly, if doctrines do in fact develop over time through expansion, contextualization, and critical correction, how can the faith communities that develop and reformulate doctrines claim to be part of the same broad Christian tradition?<br>

  Book Title: Writing Theologically-  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Barreto Eric D.<br>
  Abstract: Of course, by writing we refer to the kinds of reflections, essays, and exams students will have to complete in the seminary classroom. But writing also encompasses the many modes of communication and self-discovery that creative expression can unlock. Writing Theologically introduces writing not just as an academic exercise but as a way for students to communicate the good news in rapidly changing contexts, as well as to discover and craft their own sense of vocation and identity. Most important will be guiding students to how they might begin to claim and hone a distinctive theological voice that is particularly attuned to the contexts of writer and audience alike. In a collection of brief, readable essays, this volume, edited by Eric D. Barreto, emphasizes the vital skills, practices, and values involved in writing theologically. That is, how might students prepare themselves to communicate effectively and creatively, clearly and beautifully, the insights they gather during their time in seminary? Each contribution includes practical advice about best practices in writing theologically; however, the book also stresses why writing is vital in the self-understanding of the minister, as well as her or his public communication of the good news.<br>

  Old Memories, New Identities: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n36">Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</a><br>
  Author(s) Langille Tim<br>
  Abstract: As communities continue to shape and reshape their collective memories, new events and information are constantly combined and integrated with previous knowledge to form flexible mental schemas. Representation of trauma and construction of collective identity are facilitated by these flexible, preexisting schemas. Memories of events run back and forth in time, from past to present and vice-versa, as more recent events and figures are associated with earlier ones (Schwartz 1991, 222, 233–34; van der Kolk and van der Hart 1995, 171; Yerushalmi 1996). The shattering and disruptive experiences of trauma are processed and represented through already-existing mnemonic and narrative<br>

  Memory and Loss in Early Rabbinic Text and Ritual from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287n36">Memory and Identity in Ancient Judaism and Early Christianity</a><br>
  Author(s) Fraade Steven D.<br>
  Abstract: Early rabbinic literature poses special challenges to social memory theory and its application that are in some ways very different from those posed by the New Testament and the search for the “historical Jesus.” Conversely, early rabbinic literature provides exceptional opportunities for examining the relation between the practice and theory of collective memory in relation to the formation and maintenance of social identity. In what follows I will attend to both these challenges and opportunities (typically the flip side of one another) through the analysis of specific rabbinic texts that both thematize and practice collective memory in the face of<br>

  Abstract: Many debates on the identity of television as a medium and as an art accompanied its expansion in the United States in the late 1940s and in France in the early 1950s. In 1948, Jack Gould mentioned the fact that television found inspiration in preexisting arts to argue that, precisely because it combined “[…] the close-up of the motion picture, the spontaneity of the living stage and the instantaneousness of radio” and was “the fusion of these three elements,” it was absolutely unique.² Reviewing the 1949 season, Flora R.

  Abstract: Even as contemporary conditions precipitated a flood of peoples from the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean to the American mainland, a stream of English-speaking immigrants from the West Indies—a parallel diasporic movement—flowed to both Great Britain and the United States. These Hispanic and Commonwealth migratory streams are linked by the legacies of colonial history or what the historian Gordon Lewis (1983) describes as an “agrosocial system of slavery developed in its fullest and most harsh form” (2). Yet the formation of an AfricanCaribbean immigrant identity rooted in the history of slavery is a subject largely absent from or<br>

  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Abstract: From the outset of his career, the calling of poet has required Heaney to embark on a quest for self-definition, a quest in which every imaginative return to origins precipitates a new journey outward whereby the poet’s art and identity are redefined and enlarged. Yet, despite Heaney’s seemingly inexhaustible ability to reinvent himself in his work, the original binding connection between poet and place remains constant. The evolution of his poetry, even as it comes to embrace a vision of art and life linked to emptiness, thus consistently exemplifies what he has more recently described as a “covenant between language<br>

  Abstract: Throughout these pages I have interpreted Heaney’s poetry as a quest for self-definition, a rite of passage. Within this rite, the problem of identity emerges through the poet’s explorations of his personal history, a history that in time is set against the wider historical horizon of Heaney’s cultural past. Paradoxically, what gives his work continuity is his willingness to face discontinuity over again with each return to the source. Still, Heaney’s reliance on what has been called disparagingly a poetic of identity would appear to confirm Anthony Easthope’s criticism that Heaney’s poetry is “resolutely premodernist in its commitment to a<br>

  Abstract: Every community that wants to last beyond a single generation must concern itself with education. Education has to do with the maintenance of a community through the generations. This maintenance must assure enough continuity of vision, value, and perception so that the community sustains its self-identity. At the same time, such maintenance must assure enough freedom and novelty so that the community can survive in and be pertinent to new circumstances.¹ Thus, education must attend to processes of both continuity and discontinuity in order to avoid fossilizing into irrelevance on the one hand, and relativizing into disappearance on the other<br>

  Author(s) FLETCHER JEANNINE HILL<br>
  Abstract: Catholic Studies emerges in the North American context precisely at a time when the boundaries for identifying “Catholic” are contested. Under conditions of globalization when persons shift in and out of a variety of local and transnational affiliations, the identifier is not as clear as perhaps it once was. In earlier periods, in so-called Catholic countries, the category “Catholic” encompassed the whole of society and the definition was bound up with national and ethnic identities. In non-Catholic Christian contexts, such as in the United States, where identity was constructed “over-against” the dominant ethos, the category “Catholic” was identifiable in contrast<br>

  Abstract: Theologians ruminate among inherited concepts and images, seeking to clarify their history and judge it critically. To establish a perspective in which even a single such concept can be brought into question or deconstructed is no easy matter. To bring the entire tradition into perspective and retrieve it in a well-founded way, as Heidegger aimed to retrieve the tradition of Western metaphysics, is a prodigious task. Recently, a larger context for that task has emerged as Christians have learned that their entire tradition is only one fiber in the texture of the human religious quest.

  Abstract: What is the relation of theology to politics? Of revelation to revolution? To approach this question, I want to turn not to the constitution of the subject (Alain Badiou’s preoccupation) or to the constitution of the community (Paul’s preoccupation), because in the end these entities are not sufficient to achieve the robust political ends imagined for them. Instead, I want to turn to the question of justice (the preoccupation of the Hebrew Bible), for the infusion of this ethical concern is vital: political life must be lived under the horizon of justice.

  Book Title: Regard for the Other: Autothanatography in Rousseau, De Quincey, Baudelaire, and Wilde-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Burt E. S.<br>
  Abstract: Although much has been written on autobiography, the same cannot be said of autothanatography, the writing of one's death. This study starts from the deconstructive premise that autobiography is aporetic, not or not only a matter of a subject strategizing with language to produce an exemplary identity but a matter also of its responding to an exorbitant call to write its death. The I-dominated representations of particular others and of the privileged other to whom a work is addressed, must therefore be set against an alterity plaguing the I from within or shadowing it from without. This alterity makes itself known in writing as the potential of the text to carry messages that remain secret to the confessing subject. Anticipation of the potential for the confessional text to say what Augustine calls the secret I do not know,the secret of death, engages the autothanatographical subject in a dynamic, inventive, and open-ended process of identification. The subject presented in these texts is not one that has already evolved an interior life that it seeks to reveal to others, but one that speaks to us as still in process. Through its exorbitant response, it gives intimations of an interiority and an ethical existence to come. Baudelaire emerges as a central figure for this understanding of autobiography as autothanatography through his critique of the narcissism of a certain Rousseau, his translation of De Quincey's confessions, with their vertiginously ungrounded subject-in-construction, his artistic practice of self-conscious, thorough-going doubleness, and his service to Wilde as model for an aporetic secrecy. The author discusses the interruption of narrative that must be central to the writing of one's death and addresses the I's dealings with the aporias of such structuring principles as secrecy, Levinasian hospitality, or interiorization as translation. The book makes a strong intervention in the debate over one of the most-read genres of our time.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0385">Crossover Queries: Dwelling with Negatives, Embodying Philosophy's Others</a><br>
  Abstract: Nominalists argue that everything that is must be particular. D. M. Armstrong contends, “Nominalists deny that there is any objective identity in things which are not identical. Realists, on the other hand, hold that the apparent situation is the real situation. There genuinely is, or can be, something identical. Besides particulars there are universals.”¹ Quine appreciates the difficulties of this position. Because the “quixotic” nominalist “foreswears quantification over universals, for example, classes, altogether,” Quine prefers “conceptualism,” a position that acknowledges that there are universals but holds them to be “manmade.” “Tactically conceptualism is … the strongest position … for the<br>

  Author(s) KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: The Song of Songs offers no single, stable perspective from which to view the amorous scenes unveiled on its pages. Most readers of the Song from antiquity to the present have, however, been inclined to identify with the female figure traditionally known as the Shulammite. But who is the Shulammite, and who, for that matter, is her beloved? The sustained ambiguities of identity and fluid reversals of erotic roles have made this text fertile ground for conceiving and reconceiving the mysteries of desire, in particular, the mysteries of

  Abstract: Among the most challenging issues facing environmental hermeneutics is how to think about person-world relationships in an integrated manner—not by way of conceptually separated natural environments and social spheres—as if there were either some “pure nature” untouched by our interpretations and actions or any human life apart from environmental dynamics. Rather, the interactions of the physiochemical and biological, the individuating and communal dimensions—at all scales—provide our subject matter. For instance, it makes little sense to carry on studying “sense of place” and “identity” as we have been, assuming that these phenomena are stable and that the<br>

  Book Title: Passing on the Faith: Transforming Traditions for the Next Generation of Jews, Christians, and Muslims-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Heft James L.<br>
  Abstract: From the beginning, the Abrahamic faiths-Judaism, Christianity, and Islam-have stressed the importance of transmitting religious identity from one generation to the next. Today, that sustaining mission has never been more challenged. Will young people have a faith to guide them? How can faith traditions anchor religious attachments in this secular, skeptical culture?The fruit of a historic gathering of scholars and religious leaders across three faiths and many disciplines, this important book reports on the religious lives of young people in today's world. It's also a unique inventory of creative and thoughtful responses from churches, synagogues, and mosques working to keep religion a significant force in those lives.The essays are grouped thematically. Opening the book, Melchor Sanchez de Toca and Nancy Ammerman explore fundamental issues that have an impact on religion-from the cultural effects of global consumerism and personal technology to pluralism and individualism. In Part Two, leading investigators present three leading studies of religiosity among young people and college students in the United States, illuminating the gap between personal values and organized religion-and the emergence of new, different forms of spirituality and faith. How religious institutions deal with these challenges forms the heart of the book-in portraits of best practicesdeveloped to revitalize traditional institutions, from a synagogue in New York City and a Muslim youth camp in California to the famed French Catholic community of the late Brother John of Taiz. Finally, Jack Miles and Diane Winston weave the findings into a broader perspective of the future of religious belief, practice, and feeling in a changing world.Filled with real-world wisdom, Passing the Faith will be an essential resource for anyone seeking to understand what religions must, and can, do to inspire a vigorous faith in the next generation.<br>

  Abstract: All human communities face the general challenge of social reproduction—that is, socializing subsequent generations to carry on community identities and practices. Meeting this challenge successfully requires effective practices of socialization, identity formation, role modeling, intergenerational transference of authority, and so on. Many other factors, however, typically play into the success or breakdown of social reproduction, including competing institutional demands and changing social environmental conditions that make passing on a collective way of life over time more or less difficult. Religious communities are only one among many types of human communities that face this general challenge of reproducing themselves in<br>

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

  Author(s) Berndt Jaqueline<br>
  Abstract: In recent years, graphic narratives¹ in general and manga in particular have attracted critical attention from a variety of fields, including media and globalization research as well as Japanese, gender, and ethnic studies. This broadening of topic-oriented interest usually leads to two lines of contestation, one pertaining to manga-specific expertise and the other to culturally divergent mediascapes as contexts of productions and use. Taking a typical case of discordance—the ethnic identity of manga characters—opinions differ notoriously as to whether mangaesque faces and physiques are to be regarded as “stateless” (
                  mukokuseki) or “Caucasian.” The latter position may meet manga<br>

  Book Title: Dostoevsky and the Novel-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Holquist Michael<br>
  Abstract: Michael Holquist shows that the generic impulse of the novel to explore the mysteries of individual biography met and fused in Dostoevsky's works with the national quest of the Russians for an identity of their own. The paradox of the writer's achievement consists in the degree to which his meditations on the significance of being without a past are grounded in history.<br>

  Abstract: The Idiotends in a Swiss asylum;The Possessed,Dostoevsky’s next novel, concludes with two notes from that already dead citizen of the canton of Uri, Nicholas Stavrogin. Silence of madness, silence of suicide—so end novels that take their shape from characters unable to find coherent stories for themselves. The discontinuity of identity is in both cases dramatized as a temporal rupture, but a different kind of cutoff in time defines the conditions of each dilemma.<br>

Sekiya Teizaburo, the education director in the colonial government, declared that “the fundamental principle of Korean education, stated in a word, is to bring up the Koreans as citizens or subjects of the Japa nese empire. . . .

  Author(s): Raessens Joost<br>
  Abstract: In
      Playful Identities, eighteen scholars examine the increasing role of digital media technologies in identity construction through play. Going beyond computer games, this interdisciplinary collection argues that present-day play and games are not only appropriate metaphors for capturing postmodern human identities, but are in fact the means by which people create their identity. From discussions of World of Warcraft and Foursquare to digital cartographies, the combined essays form a groundbreaking volume that features the most recent insights in play and game studies, media research, and identity studies.<br>

  Author(s) Bekker Tilde<br>
  Abstract: Gamers are, like Yamauchi, described as nonconformist, creative, and self-confident persons, who seem unafraid to make mistakes (Beck and Wade 2004). Is it true that games present us with an opportunity to develop a particular identity, or are specific people attracted to games that create these opportunities? In the last decade, research has been conducted into the (playful) organizational style of gamers, and into the leadership qualities that may be developed in a game (DeMarco, Lesser, and O’Driscoll 2007; Reeves and Malone 2007). The search for an answer to the above question is the aim of this chapter. To be<br>

  Author(s) Calleja Gordon<br>
  Abstract: Johan Huizinga’s work has received renewed attention with the emergence and expansion of Game Studies. An important aspect of Huizinga’s explication of play is its bounded nature. Like other cultural artefacts Huizinga describes in
                  Homo ludens(1955), the act of game playing requires the crossing of a boundary that marks the game from the ordinary world. The crossing of this boundary into game-space implies a shift in the players’ identity that takes them from their everyday, “ordinary” selves, into their ludic selves. Suits has described this as the “lusory attitude” (1978, 52); a disposition one enters into when interacting with<br>

  Abstract: The contributions in the third part of the book look at how digital media technologies shape human identities in playful ways. A common thread that weaves through these chapters is that media technologies and practices mediate how people identify with others, the world, and themselves. When new media technologies rise to the fore the mediation of identity changes along with it, and play offers a range of fruitful perspectives to understand these changes. Another common thread in these chapters involves questioning the intricate connections between play and everyday life. From being a more or less separate space for experimenting with<br>

In particular, I intend to situate my analysis at the juncture between ludic culture, social control, and the social construction of the “ir-responsible” identity. The reason for this choice is that contemporary ludic culture can be quite well understood in light of the current imposition of social control and the mass resistance that is building against it.

Reasons include the lagging state of fixed telephony in homes; its affordability even for low-income people; and omnipresent branding that induces an acute sense of “must have”. Most importantly and central in this chapter, mobile phones offer urban Indonesians rich opportunities for identity construction and expression.

  Abstract: It is relatively easy to find examples of deep, immersive play that has effects on personal or social identity: an intensive psychodrama, live action role-play, and even some massively multiplayer online (MMO) game players report experiences that have affected the ways they perceive themselves, or human condition in general. Most of contemporary play, however, is not deep or transformative in a similar manner. This article will focus on casual gameplay that takes place in common games such as Solitaire, or more recently games such as

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmakers themselves had to confront the self-destructive aspects of their ethnic background, not only to accommodate WASP audiences but to better understand their own heritage. He also observes that ethnicity is a strong draw at the box office, as in The Godfather, because it creates a sense of the Other who can both be admired and at the same time ridiculed. Illustrated with scenes of the movies discussed, this fascinating film history tells how four of America's most famous filmmakers assimilated their ethnic backgrounds on set and on screen. "Mr. Lourdeaux walks a tricky path in analyzing the films of each [director]: avoiding the trap of excessively detailing their lives and many films, while steering clear of ethnic stereotyping. Those interested in ethnic influences on outstanding persons or in the production of films by four of the best will find the book enjoyable." --The Baltimore Sun "This is an invaluable book because it arouses critical awareness of the ethnicity underlying many Hollywood movies that might otherwise appear merely to represent American archetypes." --Journal of American Studies "A valuable addition to the literature on ethnic identity in film. The insights Lourdeaux offers into major figures like Griffith, Ford, Capra, Coppola, and Scorsese contribute significantly to our understanding of their films." --Virginia Wright Wexman, University of Illinois at Chicago "For a number of years now, church historians have been giving us an account of American Catholicism that is much richer and more varied than the older institutional accounts of the Catholic Church ever let on. In this comprehensive and insightful study, Lee Lourdeaux shows us how much the ethnic movies of directors like Ford and Capra, Coppola and Scorsese have to teach us as well about Irish- and Italian-Catholic mores and instincts." --John B. Breslin, S.J., Director "A wonderfully sensitive, intelligent study of the complex issue of how the Catholic imagination works in the creative personalities of those raised in the Catholic heritage." --Andrew M.

  Abstract: When I was growing up in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, your religion defined your identity and there was one common question: ‘Are you one of us or one of them?’ This was shorthand for ‘Are you a Catholic or a Protestant?’ In truth, I belonged neither to ‘us’ nor ‘them’. My father, an Ulster Presbyterian, had met my mother, a Leinster Catholic, when she nursed in Belfast in the early 1950s.

  Abstract: “Civilized Girl,” the title poem of Jully Makini’s first collection of poetry, published in 1981 (Sipolo 1981)—the first by a Solomon Islands woman—is about a young urban-based Solomon Island girl questioning her identity. “Roviana Girl,” published five years later in Makini’s second collection,
                  Praying Parents(Sipolo 1986), is about a village-based girl critiquing her changing society. In indigenous literature, the urban-based civilized girl often serves as a trope for the ills of Westernization and colonization. She is implicitly contrasted with the traditional girl, who is based in the village and whose adherence to static traditional roles remains unquestioned<br>

  Abstract: Rhetoric works to resolve conflict by forging agreement. Aesthetic works to provide diverse people with a common experience. Both, whether directly or by considerable indirection, help people who find they must share a space move from contention to community. They do that by communicating identity—a sense of self and affiliation for those who are addressed to adopt for themselves. So we might phrase it this way: rhetoric forges the kind of agreement we understand in conceptual terms, while aesthetic offers an opportunity to experience that agreement by inhabiting with others at least for a moment a common identity.

  Book Title: Resisting history-Religious transcendence and the invention of the unconscious<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Hayward Rhodri<br>
  Abstract: How can historians make sense of visions, hauntings and demonic possession? Do miraculous events have any place in a world governed by cause and effect? In Resisting history, Rhodri Hayward examines the cumulative attempts of theologians, historians and psychologists to create a consistent and rational narrative capable of containing the inexplicable. This lucid and provocative account argues that the psychological theories we routinely use to make sense of supernatural experience were born out of struggles between popular mystics and conservative authorities. Hayward’s lively analysis of the Victorian disciplines of Christology, psychology and psychical research reveals how our modern concept of the subconscious was developed as a tool for policing religious inspiration. He concludes his argument with a vivid study of the Welsh Revival of 1904-5, in which the attempt of thousands of converts to cast off their everyday identity was diffused and defeated using the language of the new psychology. By revealing the politics inherent in such language, Hayward raises questions about its deployment in the work of today’s historians. Written in a clear and accessible style, Resisting history provides a fresh and entertaining perspective for anyone interested in questioning the concepts that underlie historical writing and psychological thought today.<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

  Book Title: Contemporary Violence-Postmodern war in Kosovo and Chechnya<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Moore Cerwyn<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary Violence: Postmodern War in Kosovo and Chechnya draws on several years of field research, as well as interpretive IR theory and analysis of empirical source material so as to shed light on contemporary violence. Drawing on interpretive approaches to International Relations, the book argues that founding events and multiple contexts informed the narratives deployed by different members of each movement, illustrating why elements within the Kosovo Liberation Army and the armed forces of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria favoured regional and local strategies of war in the Balkans and the North Caucasus. The book draws on post-positivist analysis and empirical research so as unravel the relationship between narratives, stories and hermeneutic accounts of International Relations; regional politics and trans-local identity; globalisation and visual aspects of contemporary security; criminality and emotionality; which together illustrate the dynamics within the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and the North Caucasus and the road to war in 1999. The book is a major addition to a small field of genuinely readable studies of IR theory. The book will be of interest to academics, researchers, students, area studies experts and policy-makers seeking to understand the formation of the armed resistance movements in Kosovo and Chechnya. Amongst other things, the book will be of interest to students and scholars of International Relations, Political Studies, Area Studies, as well as those within Cultural and Historical and Sociological Studies.<br>

  Abstract: Some – if not all – contemporary wars are conducted for a multiplicity of reasons by an increasingly diverse set of actors. One corollary of this may be a reading of a broader spectrum of political violence which is neither exclusively political nor military, but is in part shaped by cultural and social forces captured in narrative. Even if narrative approaches have a long provenance in other disciplines, they have only recently touched the shores of IR. And yet, an approach which addresses accounts of narrative identity does much to capture the social, cultural and ontological assumptions which inform our<br>

Indeed, Christian communal identity has largely been formed around a set of literary texts that together form canonical scripture.

After Jesus claims to be the “light of the world” (8:12), the Pharisees reply that Jesus testifies to himself, which automatically invalidates the content of his testimony (8:13). Jesus counters their concern with a concession: “even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I go; but you do not know where I come from or where I go” (8:14). The Pharisees’ purported lack of knowledge about Jesus’s true identity corresponds to,<br>

  Author(s) Kolen Jan<br>
  Abstract: Even more so than the large urban networks of our time, the natural landscapes of the prehistoric past appear to have been anonymous entities, largely devoid of humans and lacking individual authorship. However, on closer inspection, even the most ‘anonymous’, ‘natural’ and ‘original’ of landscapes bears the imprint of human authorship and personal identity, not only in terms of past human presence and practices, but also in terms of aesthetic experiences, retrospective vision, scientific interpretation and naturalist engagement. For this reason, this chapter explores the possibilities of a biographical approach to places and landscapes that we conventionally experience as natural.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xkf">Post-Holocaust France and the Jews, 1945-1955</a><br>
  Author(s) MANDEL MAUD<br>
  Abstract: Was World War II a radical break in French Jewish history—a turning point in notions of community, identity, and political expression—or did the restoration of Jewish citizenship and the Fourth Republic’s promise to protect and defend all citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin allow long-standing patterns of Jewish identification to reinstate themselves? This chapter will address this question by turning to an aspect of Jewish communal life that transcended the pre- and postwar years—that of how to integrate incoming Jewish refugees and immigrants into communal institutions and French society more broadly. To be sure, the question<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Criminology-Understanding Stories of Crime<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Sandberg Sveinung<br>
  Abstract: Stories are much more than a means of communication-stories help us shape our identities, make sense of the world, and mobilize others to action. In
         Narrative Criminology, prominent scholars from across the academy and around the world examine stories that animate offending. From an examination of how criminals understand certain types of crime to be less moral than others, to how violent offenders and drug users each come to understand or resist their identity as 'criminals', to how cultural narratives motivate genocidal action, the case studies in this book cover a wide array of crimes and justice systems throughout the world.<br>

  Author(s) SANDBERG SVEINUNG<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are central to human existence. By constructing our lives as stories, we forge connections among experiences, actions, and aspirations. We know ourselves as
                  oneover time—one consistent moral actor or one unified group of moral actors—however numerous or varied the cultural story elements that we access and integrate into our self-stories. Our self-stories condition what we will do tomorrow because whatever tomorrow brings, our responses must somehow cohere with the storied identity generated thus far. Criminologists have made ample use of offenders’ narratives, mainly, albeit not exclusively, as vehicles for data on the factors that promote criminal<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) FLEETWOOD JENNIFER<br>
  Abstract: Rather than approach offenders’ narratives as a record of events, narrative criminologists see talk as a form of social action (Presser 2009; Sandberg 2010, 2011). Building on Sykes and Matza’s techniques of neutralization, research in this vein has mainly explored narrative in the construction of deviant or desisting identity (Maruna and Copes 2005; see also Copes et al. 2008; Sandberg 2011; Topalli 2005). Although important developments have been made, women offenders’ narratives have been somewhat absent.¹ They arguably warrant special consideration: women’s offending is less common, their offending careers are shorter, and they are less likely to have co-offenders than<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt15r3xt2">Narrative Criminology</a><br>
  Author(s) WALDRAM JAMES B.<br>
  Abstract: Disruptive life events can shatter the complacent, routine, and unreflective nature of human existence, one’s sense of what it means to be normal and live a normal life (Becker 1997). Such events create narrative turmoil, challenging our sense of self and identity, and the way in which we choose to project these to the world at large (Garro and Mattingly 2000; Viney and Bousfield 1991). Troubling events force their way into our personal narratives, and compel us to consider the value inherent in acknowledging or hiding such events as we refashion our self-narratives and confront a world that may—we<br>

  Abstract: In the exploration of the emergence of a ‘mysticism of politics’ and a ‘politics of mysticism’ through developments in the nineteenth century a number of conclusions were suggested. It was proposed that the ‘mysticism of politics’ appears to gain currency precisely at times of political and social innovation in which there exists the experience of the potential of human agency according to an evangelical vision. Secondly, it was suggested that in a modern, liberal society in which it discovers itself as one voice amongst others the Church will tend towards a ‘politics of mysticism’ for social identity.

In this new context the question of Christian identity assumes a new and urgent importance and finds expression in, among other things, a concern to articulate the uniqueness of the gospel. A particular difficulty with this task today is that it has to be executed in relation to efforts by those of other faiths to clarify their own religious identity.

The essays explore the role and function of image making to highlight the ways in which the images "speak" and what visual languages mean for the construction of Islamic subjectivities, the distribution of power, and the formation of identity and belonging.

  Abstract: Marion has explored sacraments and especially the Eucharist throughout his work, beginning with his rather controversial treatment in

On the one hand, it is obviously a central liturgical rite that particularly defines Christian identity. It is therefore especially significant for a phenomenology that seeks to explore religious experience. One might say that the Eucharist is Christian religious experience par excellence. On the other hand, the Eucharist is believed to be a central place ofGod’sself-revelation. The Eucharist<br>

  Author(s) Hengehold Laura<br>
  Abstract: Nonidentity has been perpetually stifled in Africa by discourses and practices of repression. Research is needed to show how the political dimension affects the concept of possibility in Critical Theory and in the confrontation between African modernity and its possibilities. Further, the epistemo-political importance of such an inquiry must be demonstrated. Finally, given the multiplicity of parameters that may be generated by every discourse on the political domain or political practice, we must identify the

  Author(s) Wells Paul<br>
  Abstract: The work of Jan Svankmajer, celebrated Czechoslovakian animator and avant-garde filmmaker, demonstrates an ongoing pre-occupation with the codes and conditions of bodily function and identity. His fictions are characterised by the recognition of transience in the body and the place of the body as a defining instrument in socio-cultural mechanisms and indeed, as a socio-cultural mechanism. Svankmajer uses the unique vocabulary of animation in expressing these principles and essentially re-defines the conditions by which the body might be represented and re-defined aesthetically and politically.<br>

  Abstract: I think of philosophy, feminism, and Judaism as communities to which I belong because I have made commitments to them, but also because they have made investments in me. It is less the case that I chose to join them, and more accurate to say that they chose me. The relationship I have with them is often frustrating, and yet generally enlightening. They are the burden I “can neither bear nor throw off.”¹ At the same time, they are integral to my identity, and so perhaps, “burden” is entirely too strong a word.

  Book Title: The Year's Work at the Zombie Research Center-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAFFE AARON<br>
  Abstract: They have stalked the horizons of our culture, wreaked havoc on moribund concepts of dead and not dead, threatened our sense of identity, and endangered our personal safety. Now zombies have emerged from the lurking shadows of society's fringes to wander the sacred halls of the academy, feasting on tender minds and hurling rot across our intellectual landscape. It is time to unite in common cause, to shore up defenses, firm up critical and analytical resources, and fortify crumbling lines of inquiry. Responding to this call, Brain Workers from the Zombie Research Center poke and prod the rotting corpus of zombie culture trying to make sense of cult classics and the unstoppable growth of new and even more disturbing work. They exhume "zombie theory" and decaying historical documents from America, Europe, and the Caribbean in order to unearth the zombie world and arm readers with the brain tools necessary for everyday survival. Readers will see that zombie culture today "lives" in shapes as mutable as a zombie horde-and is often just as violent.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gzkjc">Latin American Philosophy from Identity to Radical Exteriority</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapters we found a call for recognizing Latin American philosophy, which may be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s in the work of Leopoldo Zea, along with other Latin American philosophers such as Arturo Ardao in Uruguay and Francisco Romero in Argentina. For these philosophers the fundamental questions were those of the identity, sense, and possibilities of a Latin American philosophy. As discussed in chapter 2, Salazar Bondy responded to these questions in 1968, and Leopoldo Zea engaged with that negative critique in 1969 in

  Author(s) Powell Russell<br>
  Abstract: Considering the role of democracy in the United States, Peru, Lithuania, and Indonesia presents opportunities for comparing the influence of culture and dominant religion on the development of political and legal systems. In particular, it invites inquiry into similarities and distinctions between predominantly Muslim societies and predominantly Christian or Catholic societies in their approaches to democracy. Examining the role of Islam in Turkish law and politics as a comparative example, this chapter explores approaches to reconciling religious identity with legal secularism (the mechanism states use to insulate themselves from religious influence) in liberal democracies.<br>

  Abstract: What greatly marks the relationships between democracy, culture, and Catholicism in the United States are the particular political and theological contexts from which the identity of US citizens emerged. The republic was established on the principles of democracy, and its culture was greatly affected and influenced by the prominent place enjoyed by Protestant Christianity among the people. Catholicism was an “outsider” religion that was not to be trusted and, worse, appeared to be completely incompatible with the political and cultural milieu of the nation.

  Book Title: Video Games Around the World-  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): IWATANI TORU<br>
  Abstract: Video games have become a global industry, and their history spans dozens of national industries where foreign imports compete with domestic productions, legitimate industry contends with piracy, and national identity faces the global marketplace. This volume describes video game history and culture across every continent, with essays covering areas as disparate and far-flung as Argentina and Thailand, Hungary and Indonesia, Iran and Ireland. Most of the essays are written by natives of the countries they discuss, many of them game designers and founders of game companies, offering distinctively firsthand perspectives. Some of these national histories appear for the first time in English, and some for the first time in any language.Readers will learn, for example, about the rapid growth of mobile games in Africa; how a meat-packing company held the rights to import the Atari VCS 2600 into Mexico; and how the Indonesian MMORPG
      Nusantara Onlinereflects that country's cultural history and folklore. Every country or region's unique conditions provide the context that shapes its national industry; for example, the long history of computer science in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia, the problems of piracy in China, the PC Bangs of South Korea, or the Dutch industry's emphasis on serious games. As these essays demonstrate, local innovation and diversification thrive alongside productions and corporations with global aspirations.Africa • Arab World • Argentina • Australia • Austria • Brazil • Canada • China • Colombia • Czech Republic • Finland • France • Germany • Hong Kong • Hungary • India • Indonesia • Iran • Ireland • Italy • Japan • Mexico • The Netherlands • New Zealand • Peru • Poland • Portugal • Russia • Scandinavia • Singapore • South Korea • Spain • Switzerland • Thailand • Turkey • United Kingdom • United States of America • Uruguay • Venezuela<br>

Second, there is a charismatic crossover, encompassing diverse modes along with classic wisdom divination. In the city, some diviners originally from Moremi village, have very recently combined wisdom divination with exotic forms, including Christian spiritual practices.

  Abstract: Recent years have seen the rise of widespread interest in cultural and collective memory and their relation to history, power, voice, identity and representation. This interest is shared by family, local and academic history, museums and community projects and increasingly groups that perceive themselves as marginal to mainstream national and public history. The authors of this chapter have over twenty-five years of experience working with people’s history and community memories. These are areas that we will argue are particularly important in multi-ethnic societies like Wales where they are tied to issues of roots, identity and belonging.<br>

  Abstract: The link between rural Wales and notions of authentic Welshness has been a long-standing theme in both the academic literature and in popular representations. The Welsh countryside and its imagined characteristics hold a very privileged place in dominant constructions of national identity. Myths of a peaceable and tolerant nation, deeply embedded in the national imaginary are rooted in an idealized Welsh rural community life that summons the trope of the gwerin, a particular form of localized communitarianism to express the values of egalitarianism, classlessness and internationalism. Myths are of course important to nation building but they also function as a<br>

  Abstract: In over a decade of devolution Welshness has been reclaimed and reworked in new and interesting ways. Debates about nation and national identity may have always been a Welsh preoccupation but devolution has served to focus them more sharply in academic research and writing, in the arts and literature and in the public consciousness. The achievement of a measure of self-governance by a small but highly self-conscious nation was bound to carry symbolic significance in terms of Welsh identity, perhaps more so than the disruptions of constitutional reform itself. Counter narratives have emerged that have challenged dominant versions of Welsh<br>

  Book Title: Mestizaje and Globalization-Transformations of Identity and Power<br>
  Publisher: University of Arizona Press<br>
  Author(s): YOUNG PHILIP D.<br>
  Abstract: The Spanish word
      mestizajedoes not easily translate into English. Its meaning and significance have been debated for centuries since colonization by European powers began. Its simplest definition is "mixing." As long as the term has been employed, norms and ideas about racial and cultural relations in the Americas have been imagined, imposed, questioned, rejected, and given new meaning.Mestizaje and Globalizationpresents perspectives on the underlying transformation of identity and power associated with the term during times of great change in the Americas. The volume offers a comprehensive and empirically diverse collection of insights concerning mestizaje's complex relationship with indigeneity, the politics of ethnic identity, transnational social movements, the aesthetic of cultural production, development policies, and capitalist globalization, with particular attention to cases in Latin America and the United States.Beyond the narrow and often inadequate meaning of mestizaje as biological and racial mixing, the concept deserves an innovative theoretical consideration due to its multidimensional, multifaceted character and its resilience as an ideological construct. The contributors argue that historical analyses of mestizaje do not sufficiently understand contemporary ways that racism, ethnic discrimination, and social injustice intermingle with current discourse and practice of cultural recognition and multiculturalism in the Americas.Mestizaje and Globalizationcontributes to an emerging multidisciplinary effort to explore how identities are imposed, negotiated, and reconstructed. The chapter authors clearly set forth the issues and obstacles that Indigenous peoples and subjugated minorities face, as well as the strategies they have employed to gain empowerment in the face of globalization.<br>

  Author(s) BARCHI FABRIZIO ARENAS<br>
  Abstract: Mestizajeis a complex and nuanced ideology. Of the notions that the social sciences treat, mestizaje is perhaps one of the more opaque—and loaded. The notion itself encompasses other ideas such as “race,” “culture,” “identity,” and “ethnicity” in fabricating its multiple applications in everyday social, political, and academic settings. These applications overlap each other, producing successive interpretations of what it may be that is being mixed in the mestizaje. These overlapping applications of mestizaje in everyday life all seem to be interwoven with the same thread: the different ways of dealing with diversity.<br>

  Abstract: The sixteenth century shaped not only the identity of what would later become Latin America but also laid the basis for the emergence of the capitalist world-system (Wallerstein, 1999), the emergence of the coloniality of power (Quijano, 2000) and the advent of modernity (Dussel, 1994). These events profoundly influenced the endogenous and exogenous dynamics of different societies and human groups. In the late fifteenth century, and at the dawn of the sixteenth century, such transcendental phenomena were generated in everyday life around the world (

In this chapter we argue that a psycho-social dimension goes beyond traditional analysis and allows us to understand the emotional, affective and visceral content of identity construction. Drawing on psychoanalytic ideas and concepts, we unravel the psychological dynamics involved in the construction of the white ‘we’ in relation to the otherness of the Other. Cultural identities are marked by a number of factors – ‘race’, ethnicity, gender and class to name but a few – yet the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183p383">White Identities</a><br>
  Abstract: The idea of community has always been central to the construction of group and individual identity. It has been the site of moral panics about the disintegration of traditional community and values as well as concerns around racism and segregation (see chapter 5). The notion of community is of central importance in contemporary policy and political thinking. So, for example, as Anna Marie Smith (1992) argues in the 1980s and early 1990s new right Thatcherite policy concentrated on creating a hegemonic project that aimed at defining social space through the construction of outsider figures.

  Abstract: Psycho-social studies is an emerging tradition that very much focuses on emotion and affect to illuminate some of the core issues in the social sciences. Issues such as identity construction, dilemmas in public service sectors and the experience of rapid social change. It recognises that the split between individual and society, sociology and psychology is now unhelpful if we are to understand social and psychological phenomena. It therefore seeks to research beneath the surface using both psychoanalytic and sociological ideas using innovative new methodologies including the use of free association, biographical life history interviews and the development of psychoanalytic fieldwork.<br>

  Abstract: Our exploration of the themes of community and identity in provincial England is necessarily qualified. Our sample was relatively small and restricted to two cities. However, we suggest, in the light of further research, which admittedly focused on working-class respondents (Hoggett et al., 2008; Garner et al., 2009), that the discourses on community, Britishness and whiteness are generally applicable outside of some large metropolitan areas where Gilroy’s model of conviviality might be the dominant mode. The temptation for researcher and reader alike is to become absorbed into the details and start to lose track of the bigger picture. There are<br>

  Abstract: One of the most promising areas of future research into literature and national identity in early republican Mexico is the literature of the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846–1848. Mexican literary responses to the United States’ invasion of its territory, and to Mexico’s continued defeats on the battlefield, constitute an invaluable archive for examining the emergence of Mexican nationalism. Indeed, during the war and its aftermath, Mexican writers recognized the value of national unity as they never had before, because they saw their defeat on the battlefield as a function of their political disunity. “A nation is nothing but a large<br>

  Book Title: Community, Cosmopolitanism and the Problem of Human Commonality-  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: In this follow up to their widely read earlier volume, The Trouble with Community, Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport ask: 'Do notions of community remain central to our sense of who we are, in the dislocating context of globalization, or can we see beyond community closures to a human whole?' This volume explores the variable nature of contemporary sociality. It focuses on the ethical, organizational and emotional claims and opportunities sought or fashioned for mobilizing and evading social collectivities in a world of mobile subjects. Here is an examination of the tensions and interactions between everyday forms of fluid fellowship, culturally normative claims to identity, and opportunities for realizing a universal humanity. The book offers a new perspective on human commonality through a dialogue between two eminent anthropologists who come from distinct, but complementary positions.<br>

  Book Title: Cities of Affluence and Anger-A Literary Geography of Modern Englishness<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KALLINEY PETER J.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a compact literary history of the twentieth century in England, Cities of Affluence and Anger studies the problematic terms of national identity during England's transition from an imperial power to its integration in the global cultural marketplace. While the countryside had been the dominant symbol of Englishness throughout the previous century, modern literature began to turn more and more to the city to redraw the boundaries of a contemporary cultural polity. The urban class system, paradoxically, still functioned as a marker of wealth, status, and hierarchy throughout this long period of self-examination, but it also became a way to project a common culture and mitigate other forms of difference. Local class politics were transformed in such a way that enabled the English to reframe a highly provisional national unity in the context of imperial disintegration, postcolonial immigration, and, later, globalization.Kalliney plots the decline of the country-house novel through an analysis of Forster's Howards End and Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, each ruthless in its sabotage of the trope of bucolic harmony. The traditionally pastoral focus of English fiction gives way to a high-modernist urban narrative, exemplified by Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and, later, to realists such as Osborne and Sillitoe, through whose work Kalliney explores postwar urban expansion and the cultural politics of the welfare state. Offering fresh new readings of Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, the author considers the postwar appropriation of domesticity, the emergence of postcolonial literature, and the renovation of travel narratives in the context of globalization. Kalliney suggests that it is largely one city--London--through which national identity has been reframed. How and why this transition came about is a process that Cities of Affluence and Anger depicts with exceptional insight and originality.<br>

  6.  MAD GOAT IN THE ATTIC: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt183q3bk">Cities of Affluence and Anger</a><br>
  Abstract: Most academics read
                  The Satanic Verses(1988) as an extended meditation on cultural hybridity. As Gayatri Spivak argues, its mode of representation is “citation, reinscription, re-routing the historical,“epitomizing postcoloniality because it systematically dislodges “every metropolitan definition” (104). The novel is predicated on this trope of postcolonial disruption, foregrounding the political and cultural fallout of imperial contraction and the immigration of former colonial subjects to the metropole. InThe Location of Culture,Homi Bhabha famously reads Rushdie’s novel as a testament to “culture’s [inherent]hybridity” and the “indeterminacy of diasporic identity” (38, 225).

  Abstract: Unmistakably the recipients of Philippians told their own stories and took initiatives to make major shifts in identity and behavior related to their narratives. Joining a new group with a foreign orientation was the product of a narrative that began with deficiencies, closely related to their social and economic situation, and belonging to the assembly played a major role in surmounting them. But their initiatives are hidden under the initiatives of another—Paul. They are subjects of his discourse rather than spokespersons of their own. Is it possible for them to speak for themselves?<br>

  Abstract: ‘Whose diaspora, whose migration, whose identity?’ (Mac Einrí and Lambkin, 2002) remain uncomfortable questions in post-partition Ireland. For although the concept of diaspora has proliferated in academic discourses of migration and identity since the 1990s, most often its application in the Irish context as a ‘victim’ diaspora (Cohen, 1997) has referred principally to the large number of famine emigrants, mostly Catholics and successive chain migrations of that group, primarily to the United States from 1845 to 1870.² The migration of Protestants from Ireland has tended to be set apart in an often partisan and somewhat marginalised literature on the Scotch-Irish<br>

It analyses the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a live event, as an archive, and in various theatrical engagements with it, asking throughout how the TRC has affected the definition of identity and memory in contemporary South Africa, including disavowed memories. Hutchison then considers how the SA-Mali Timbuktu Manuscript Project and the 2010 South African World Cup opening ceremony attempted to restage the nation in their own ways. She investigates how the Voortrekker Monument and Freedom Park embody issues related to memory in contemporary South Africa. She also analyses current renegotiations of popular repertoires, particularly songs and dances related to the Struggle, revivals of classic European and South African protest plays, new history plays and specific racial and ethnic histories and identities.<br>

  Book Title: The Trouble with Community-Anthropological Reflections on Movement, Identity and Collectivity<br>
  Publisher: Pluto Press<br>
  Author(s): Mitchell Jon P.<br>
  Abstract: 'Community' is one of social science's longest-standing concepts. The assumption, of much social science, has been that it is in communities -- and to communities -- that human individuals, as social and cultural beings, belong. Communities are said to embody that interactive environment from which individuals' identities and senses of self derive, and in which they continue to dwell. The trouble with 'community' is that this is not necessarily so; the personal social networks of individuals' actual experience crosscut collective categories, situations and institutions. Communities can prove unviable or imprisoning; the reality of community life and identity can often be very different from the ideology and the ideal. In this provocative new book, anthropologists Vered Amit and Nigel Rapport draw on their various ethnographic experiences to reappraise the concept and the reality of 'community', in the light of globalization, religious fundamentalism, identity politics, and renascent localisms. How might anthropology better apprehend social identities which are intrinsically plural, transgressive and ironic? What has anthropology to say about the way in which civil society might hope to accommodate the on-going construction and the rightful expression of such migrant identities? Nigel Rapport and Vered Amit give their own answers to these questions before entering into dialogue to assess each other's positions. Nigel Rapport is Professor of Anthropological and Philosophical Studies at the University of St. Andrews. He is author of Transcendent Individual (1997). Vered Amit is an Associate Professor at Concordia University in Montreal. She is the editor of Realizing Community (2002).<br>

  Abstract: Clearly, when we speak of bodies, we are speaking of ourselves, and furthermore our bodies as they are embedded in technology. Rather than thinking of ourselves as abstractions, our selves are a rich mix of dimensions that defy separation—they exist together in ways that our words and concept struggle to understand. The central issue is human identity. It’s about the struggle to arrive at the meaning of being human today, or theological anthropology. The struggle to arrive at human meaning is the grappling with our own human creativity, particularly in its technological expression. This struggle is at the heart<br>

  Book Title: Exodus and Resurrection-The God of Israel in the Theology of Robert W. Jenson<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Nicol Andrew W.<br>
  Abstract: Exodus and Resurrection establishes the important place God’s identity as the “God of Israel" has in the systematic theology of Robert W. Jenson. The work demonstrates that the identification of the God of Israel as the agent of Jesus’ resurrection functions as a foundational premise in Jenson’s Trinitarian theology. Andrew W. Nicol argues that a central characteristic of Jenson’s work is not merely his recognition that the same God who rescued Israel from Egypt raised Jesus from the dead, or the related yet distinct step of renovating his theology in a nonsupersessionist fashion, but also his attempt to conceive of the full implications for doing so in Christian theology, in the church’s self-understanding, and in the church’s relation to Israel and continuing Judaism. In this, Exodus and Resurrection provides a clear and critically appreciative account of Robert W. Jenson’s work and offers a new vital architectonic map of Jenson’s systematic vision.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: In biblical Israel’s narrative, there is a telling of God’s identity that is not finally reducible to a mere expression of “normal” religion’s apprehension of deity. This chapter further explicates Jenson’s understanding of this “telling,” of Israel’s history, and the manner in which this drama makes and shapes the gospel promise. In addition, while aspects of Jenson’s account of the God of Israel’s intimate dealings with this people are relatively conventional, others have attracted considerable criticism. This extrapolation seeks to draw attention to innovation and locate Jenson’s characteristic moves within the conceptual nexus that integrates his system, highlighting their significance<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: As noted in chapter 1, this book is concerned to assess the impact Jenson’s understanding of the God of Israel has on his wider systematic framework, including its effect on the overall coherence of his thought. In so doing, it also seeks to situate his work within the wider dogmatic tradition, insofar as this illuminates and scrutinizes his work and the importance of the abiding significance of God’s identity as the “God of Israel.” We have seen in earlier chapters that Jenson’s explication of the dogmatic centrality of the God of Israel touches on almost all loci of theology proper.<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1b3t751">Exodus and Resurrection</a><br>
  Abstract: Sustained engagement with Jenson’s thinking has issued in deep admiration for the integration of his “system” and his astonishing blend of concision and penetration. This book has sought to bring into relief a thread that undulates throughout his system. At times this thread, the God of Israel, is a prominent identification in Jenson’s formulations, and at other times the identification is below the surface. Even so, it is never absent. I have argued that Jenson’s attention to the centrality of God’s identity as the God of Israel permeates his theology, and its profound importance for Christian theology is convincingly developed<br>

  Book Title: Grand Hotel Abyss-Desire, Recognition and the Restoration of the Subject<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Safatle Vladimir<br>
  Abstract: Long-expected translation of the Portuguese academic bestseller Grande Hotel Abismo. In the last two decades recognition - arguably one of the most central notions of the dialectical tradition since Hegel - has once again become a crucial philosophical theme. Nevertheless, the new theories of recognition fail to provide room for reflection on transformation processes in politics and morality. This book aims to recover the disruptive nature of the dialectical tradition by means of a severe critique of the dominance of an anthropology of the individual identity in contemporary theories of recognition. This critique implies a thorough rethinking of basic concepts such as desire, negativity, will and drive, with Hegel, Lacan and Adorno being our main guides. The Marxist philosopher György Lukács said that the Frankfurt School (Horkheimer, Adorno, etc.) left us with nothing but negativity towards the state of the world. Their work failed to open up a concrete possibility of practical engagement in this world. All too eager to describe the impasses of reason, the Frankfurt philosphers remained trapped in a metaphorical Grand Hotel Abyss (Grand Hotel Abgrund). It was as living and being guardian of lettered civilization in a beautiful and melancholy grand hotel, of which the balconies face a gaping abyss. But perhaps in this way Lukács gave – and no doubt without realizing it himself – a perfect definition of contemporary philosophy, namely to confront chaos, to peer into what appears to a certain rationality as an abyss and to feel good about it. Touching Hegelian dialectics, critical theory and psychoanalysis, Grand Hotel Abyss gives a new meaning to the notion of negativity as the first essential step for rethinking political and moral engagement.<br>

  Book Title: Early Cinema and the "National"-  Publisher: John Libbey Publishing<br>
  Author(s): King Rob<br>
  Abstract: While many studies have been written on national cinemas, Early Cinema and the "National" is the first anthology to focus on the concept of national film culture from a wide methodological spectrum of interests, including not only visual and narrative forms, but also international geopolitics, exhibition and marketing practices, and pressing linkages to national imageries. The essays in this richly illustrated, landmark anthology are devoted to reconsidering the nation as a framing category for writing cinema history. Many of the 34 contributors show that concepts of a national identity played a role in establishing the parameters of cinema's early development, from technological change to discourses of stardom, from emerging genres to intertitling practices. Yet, as others attest, national meanings could often become knotty in other contexts, when concepts of nationhood were contested in relation to colonial/imperial histories and regional configurations. Early Cinema and the "National" takes stock of a formative moment in cinema history, tracing the beginnings of the process whereby nations learned to imagine themselves through moving images.<br>

  Abstract: In the early 20th century, movie stars often seemed to offer everything that real men did not.

A telling example for this discussion is the German fan magazine debate about whether or not it was acceptable to “adore” the Norwegian actor Gunnar Tolnaes, who played characters as “foreign” as an Indian maharaja, instead of the German supreme commander, Paul von Hindenburg.<br>

  Book Title: The French Exception-  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Chafer Tony<br>
  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is deeply embedded in the nation's self-image and in a range of political and academic discourses. Recently, the debate about whether France really is "exceptional" has acquired a critical edge. Against the background of introspection about the nature of "national identity," some proclaim "normalisation" and the end of French exceptionalism, while others point out to the continuing evidence that France remains distinctive at a number of levels, from popular culture to public policy. This book explores the notion of French exceptionalism, places it in its European context, examines its history and evaluate its continuing relevance in a range of fields from politics and public policy to popular culture and sport.<br>

  Abstract: Two decades ago, inquiry into narrative played but a minor role in scholarly deliberation; the relationship between narrative analysis and historiography was little explored; the term “narrative” had scarcely entered the vocabulary of psychological science. Today, the study of narrative concatenates throughout the humanities and the social sciences, and the problems raised by such analyses for our conception of history, along with the historical consciousness of the individual, are profound. Further, there are now many distinct and well-articulated orientations toward narrative: realist, phenomenological, psychodynamic, cognitive, textual, and rhetorical among them. Each raises different implications for our understanding of history, identity,<br>

  Book Title: Recollections of France-Memories, Identities and Heritage in Contemporary France<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Picard Jeanine<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Abstract: ‘Identity’ has been among the most central concepts in 20
                  thcentury psychology and sociology. It acquired its significance, which has persisted in all essentials until today, particularly in the context of pragmatist, interactionist and psychoanalytical thought,—even if the term played no role in the work of either Sigmund Freud or William James, but rather only in subsequent attempts to develop their theories of the subject and the self (Straub, 1991, 1994). Of course the remarkable career of ‘identity’ is due especially to certain works that were still close to the sources of psychoanalysis and pragmatism, even if they were<br>

  Chapter 4  Identities of the West: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1btbz63">Identities</a><br>
  Author(s) Henry Barbara<br>
  Abstract: In recent debates, notions of identity are predominantly seen as coined within the framework of modernity and subsequently criticised by postmodern thought. This chapter will explore the relation of these two modes of thinking with regard to the term identity. Attention will be focused on the controversial question of the relation of myth to the identities of the West (e.g. individual, group and national identity), and the objective will be to explore how this relation can become a philosophical testing ground for a notion of political identity that is far removed from any hegemonic claims over the various

  Author(s) Shimada Shingo<br>
  Abstract: The revival of interest in cultural identity, now a key issue in world politics and likely to remain so for some time, is an outcome of the end of the so-called Cold War. The Cold War order that had defined world politics and had assumed economic and political bipolarity is no longer dominant. ‘Culture’ has been rediscovered in an effort to explain obvious differences between states (Huntington, 1993). However, in view of the seemingly endless conflicts in many parts of the world it is increasingly doubtful whether we can justly understand and interpret conflicting realities on the basis of our<br>

  Author(s) Bryceson Deborah Fahy<br>
  Abstract: Currently, much of anthropological literature on identity finds itself in unanticipated dialogue with other social science disciplines in a period of deepening global insecurity. The optimism of the last half-century, an era viewed as one of unparalleled economic progress for much of the world, is now being replaced by a profound pessimism in the West about the spread of social intolerance and terrorism in the twenty-first century. Even before the events of 11 September and the London bombings of July 2005, unease was surfacing.

  Author(s) Hastrup Kirsten<br>
  Abstract: Identity categories are at the core of anthropological practice, in terms of both individual identities (or notions of the self ) and collective identities (or notions of ethnicity). In this chapter I shall deal primarily with the interface between the self and the collectivity in order to discuss identity as a response to multiple actualities rather than a fixed frame of subjectivity. This tallies with other attempts at understanding the self as composite and malleable (Cohen 1994; Rapport 1997). It also in its own way reflects the insight of relational identities provided by scholars of gender such as Shirley Ardener<br>

  Abstract: Within Britain, the Welsh language is often presented by the English media as controversial. In some cases it is seen as the instrument through which the minority, namely Welsh language speakers, impose their will on the majority. Promoters have been accused of encouraging linguistic racialism in Wales in the context of bilingual education policy. Yet few would deny the importance of language in a person’s identity: ‘For a man to speak one language rather than another is a ritual act, it is a statement about one’s personal status; to speak the same language as one’s neighbours expresses solidarity with those<br>

  Abstract: “Dysconscious racism” is a form of racism that tacitly accepts dominant white norms and privileges. It is not the
                  absenceof consciousness but animpairedconsciousness or distorted way of thinking about race as compared to, for example, critical consciousness. Uncritical ways of thinking about racial inequity accept certain culturally sanctioned assumptions, myths, and beliefs that justify the social and economic advantages white people have as a result of subordinating others. Anything that calls this ideology of racial privilege into question inevitably challenges the self-identity of white people who have internalized these ideological justifications.

  Author(s) CLEAVER KATHLEEN NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Like the formally neutral concept of “civil rights,” “race” usually makes one think of blacks. To link the idea of race with the social construct of whiteness is uncommon. As a rule, white Americans no longer see race in relation to their own identity, and genuinely believe that racism poses a problem for “others.” A widespread failure to acknowledge that whiteness conveys internal meanings at the same time it fulfills anti-black functions helps frustrate programs that seek to eliminate racism’s pernicious legacy.¹ Thus,

  Author(s) ROBERTS DOROTHY E.<br>
  Abstract: The genetic tie’s prominence in defining personal identity arose in a racial caste system that preserved white supremacy through a rule of racial purity. In America, perhaps the most socially significant product of the genetic link between parents and children is still race. The inheritability of one’s race—which determines one’s social status—radically distorts the lens through which we view the biological relationship between generations. It is crucial to examine the historical interplay between concepts of race, social status, and genetic connection.<br>

  Abstract: A character in Chester Himes’ 1945 novel,
                     If He Hollers Let Him Go, has a “funny thought.” He begins to “wonder when white people started to get white—or rather, when they started losing it.” The narrower question of when new immigrants “started to get white” and of what they lost in doing it has received passionate and varied treatment within African-American thought. That treatment provides the best points of entry to the question of white identity among new immigrants to date.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bw1kc5">Critical White Studies</a><br>
  Author(s) FRANKE KATHERINE M.<br>
  Abstract: In significant ways, legal texts produce a narrative of national identity. They weave stories about who we are, what we are committed to, and what we expect of one another, individually and collectively. Certain foundational fictions, like “We the People,” provide the glue that over time binds a people to its past and to one another as a nation. But should law play the same role with respect to other aspects of human identity? I think not.

  Abstract: Where we are positioned in society, and how we think of and live in our bodies, are questions we do not usually connect to the (both everyday and scholarly) claims we make about social and legal problems. “The body” and “knowledge” have traditionally been understood as unrelated categories. However, recent interdisciplinary work in philosophy and law emphasizes “positionality,” and calls into question the abstract, disembodied quality of conventional Western theories of knowledge (epistemologies) which ground the Western conception of law. Western epistemology, its critics say, has artificially bracketed off the material particulars of experience and identity, including the spatial particularity<br>

  Author(s) FLAGG BARBARA J.<br>
  Abstract: Racial identity is not a central life experience for most white people, because it does not have to be.¹ Like members of any socially dominant group, white people have the option to set aside consciousness of the characteristic that defines the dominant class—in this case, race. Thus whiteness is experienced as racelessness, and personal identity is conceived in a race-neutral manner. However, race plays quite a different role in the lives of people of color in this society. It is, again as a consequence of existing social structures that define and give meaning to racial identity, a central facet<br>

He takes it that the secular is “a concept that brings together certain behaviors, knowledges, and sensibilities in modern life.” Moreover, he stresses that “the secular is neither singular in origin nor stable in its historical identity, although it works through a series of particular oppositions.” In fact, Asad takes the view “that ‘the religious’ and the ‘secular’ are not essentially fixed categories.” He also assumes “that<br>

  Book Title: Freud's Moses-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yerushalmi Yosef Hayim<br>
  Abstract: In
      Freud's
            Mosesa distinguished historian of the Jews brings a new perspective to this puzzling work. Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi argues that while attempts to psychoanalyze Freud's text may be potentially fruitful, they must be preceded by a genuine effort to understand what Freud consciously wanted to convey to his readers. Using both historical and philological analysis, Yerushalmi offers new insights into Freud's intentions in writingMoses and Monotheism.He presents the work as Freud's psychoanalytic history of the Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish psyche-his attempt, under the shadow of Nazism, to discover what has made the Jews what they are. In the process Yerushalmi's eloquent and sensitive exploration of Freud's last work provides a reappraisal of Freud's feelings toward anti-Semitism and the gentile world, his ambivalence about psychoanalysis as a "Jewish" science, his relationship to his father, and above all a new appreciation of the depth and intensity of Freud's identity as a "godless Jew."<br>

It presupposes that as moderns we aim at a second naiveté in and through critical reflection.

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

An examination of quotidian mnemonic processes offers an opportunity for us to explore the ways in which local peoples negotiated, influenced, and responded to imperial social climates. The Roman Empire provides a salient framework for exploring memory because it was the iconic ancient empire, inscribing its control over a vast range of territories and peoples, each with its own distinct history and identity.

  Abstract: Christians all over the world struggle with issues of identity within the various different cultures in which they find themselves. Some Christians identify themselves through “Christian” tradition, which may or may not actually be Christian. No matter what culture Christians are in, they ultimately should derive their identity from the Bible. But this presents an ongoing problem. The Bible (whether Old or New Testament) was written in different cultural settings than the one Christians are in today. There are, of course, varying degrees of difference, but all cultures are different from those of biblical times. In the case of the<br>

  Abstract: Frank Thielman’s chapter, “The Group and the Individual in Salvation: The Witness of Paul,” cautions us not to belittle the individual dimension in salvation at the expense of the collective one, a tendency which is in vogue in Pauline scholarship today. Indeed, the individual and the collective aspects in salvation are closely related. This is clearly seen in the issue of identity. The identity of a person is always defined in relation to others.¹ When a person accepts Jesus Christ as Lord, he or she immediately gains a new identity: he or she is now a Christian, or a person<br>

People who believe in immortality of the soul and in resurrection of the dead do not do so just to state that personal identity will endure. They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life. The belief in life beyond death is therefore meant to affirm that there is a new world waiting for us, and that life on Earth is not the definitive, final reality.<br>

For example, Daniel rebukes the king for honoring false, inanimate “gods,” over the God of life.

  Abstract: Since the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Lutheran traditions have impacted culture and politics in many societies. At the same time, Lutheran belief has had an effect on personal faith, morality, and ethics. Modern society, however, is quite different from that at the time of the Reformation. How should we evaluate Lutheran tradition in today’s Western multicultural and post-Christian society? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran theological position that can be regarded as reasonable in a society that evidences a considerable weakening of the role of Christianity? What are the challenges raised by cultural diversity for a Lutheran theology and ethics? Is it possible to develop a Lutheran identity in a multicultural society, and is there any fruitful Lutheran contribution to the coexistence of diff erent religious and non-religious traditions in the future?<br>

The problem of otherness is not just a contemporary issue, of course; because of its intimate link with dialectic, it reverberates throughout the entire tradition of philosophy.¹ In the wake of Hegel, many thinkers have come to see the philosophical tradition as invariably favoring sameness over otherness, identity over difference, unity over plurality.

Forceful in word and deed, she had no identity crisis so far as I can tell. She knew who she was. Hulda also had what you would call presence—that is, you knew when she was in the room, just as you always knew when she was merely around the corner.<br>

  Author(s) White Holly<br>
  Abstract: The status of literary utopias at the turn of the third millennium is fraught with productive complexity. often used colloquially to deride impractical or vaguely hopeful social arrangements, the term “utopia” is still employed to signal a representation of society based on principles that direct human satisfaction. Literary theorist Krishan Kumar reflects that while utopianism is still a lively part of social and cultural life, literary utopia has waned, occluded by its alter identity—dystopian literature.¹ While others contemplate the decline of myth generally or the modern myth of progress specifically, Kumar suggests that utopian fiction may be eclipsed at<br>

  Abstract: The essays in this volume demonstrate Bonhoeffer’s significance for reflecting on the social and political dimensions of our contemporary world, which is grappling with questions of social identity and religion. As the title indicates, these essays on Bonhoeffer’s social thought are motivated by an anthropological concern: When we consider the rapid scientific advances of genetics and globally recurring human atrocities, does it not become apparent that human dignity requires a transcendent reference point? Yet as a generation justly suspicious of easy metaphysical assumptions, we also ask how any one concept of human dignity can offer the kind of transcendence and<br>

  Author(s) Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: John de Gruchy’s work, both in his essay in this volume and in previous publications,¹ already suggests that Bonhoeffer’s theology is best characterized as a Christian humanism. De Gruchy seeks to recover Christian humanism as an alternative cultural stance to scientific fundamentalism on the one hand and to religious fundamentalism on the other,² especially when the latter conflates religion and nationalism.³ Let me say from the outset that I fundamentally agree with de Gruchy’s desire to affirm a humanist identity for Christians and that Bonhoeffer is indeed a rich resource for doing so.

  Book Title: Making Memory-Jewish and Christian Explorations in Monument, Narrative, and Liturgy<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Vincent Alana M.<br>
  Abstract: The twentieth century has been called a "century of horror". Proof of that, designation can be found in the vast and ever-increasing volume of scholarly work on violence, trauma, memory, and history across diverse academic disciplines. This book demonstrates not only the ways in which the wars of the twentieth century have altered theological engagement and religious practice, but also the degree to which religious ways of thinking have shaped the way we construct historical narratives. Drawing on diverse sources - from the Hebrew Bible to Commonwealth war graves, from Greek tragedy to post-Holocaust theology - Alana M. Vincent probes the intersections between past and present, memory and identity, religion and nationality. The result is a book that defies categorization and offers no easy answers, but instead pursues an agenda of theological realism, holding out continued hope for the restoration of the world.<br>

  Abstract: The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican had a profound impact on Canadian Anglicans in two general ways: it changed their ecumenical landscape forever, and it helped guide farreaching changes in their denominational identity. As for the change in ecumenical landscape, Vatican II led Anglicans and Roman Catholics in Canada to cordial and close relationships with surprising speed. Within ten years of the opening session of Vatican II, the Canadian arms of the two communions were co-operating in such ventures as dialogue groups, local collaborations of various kinds, the Toronto School of Theology, and inter-church coalitions for social justice.

To teach the reality of social class as both a literary trope and a socio-political category, in other words, raises issues concerning, not solely pedagogy or social hierarchy, but personal agency, identity politics, and subject formation.

  Abstract: The canadian discourses of power that flow around race and racism infiltrate texts as diverse as a provincial referendum, the Multiculturalism Act, and prominent newspaper ads, and these discourses, both official and popular, are sources for a much wider public perception and sensibility, ones that foster attitudes intolerant of difference. Classroom study of these texts offers an opportunity to unravel the many unquestioned Canadian assumptions regarding ethnicity, visible minorities, and especially, First Nations identity and status.

  Abstract: Is There a Canadian Philosophy?addresses the themes of community, culture, national identity, and universal human rights, taking the Canadian example as its focus. The authors argue that nations compelled to cope with increasing demands for group recognition may do so in a broadly liberal spirit and without succumbing to the dangers associated with an illiberal, adversarial multiculturalism. They identify and describe a Canadian civic philosophy and attempt to show how thismodus operandiof Canadian public life is capable of reconciling questions of collective identity and recognition with a commitment to individual rights and related principles of liberal democracy. They further argue that this philosophy can serve as a model for nations around the world faced with internal complexities and growing demands for recognition from populations more diverse than at any previous time in their histories.<br>

  Abstract: If there is one thing urgently required in nations around the world confronted with growing demands for recognition of various forms of particularity—ethnic, cultural, linguistic, gender, and so on—it is a conception of civil association that reconciles recognition of difference with respect for the rights of individuals. Many older liberal democracies are rapidly becoming multicultural societies preoccupied with collective identities while many emerging democracies face similar challenges, often while struggling simultaneously to overcome a legacy of authoritarian and/or colonial rule. The dark side of identity politics has been illustrated all too frequently in modern times, most recently by<br>

  Author(s) Fairfield Paul<br>
  Abstract: While not an altogether new phenomenon, political argumentation in recent times has increasingly opted for a discourse of collective identity over traditional liberal discourses of utility, the common good, and individual rights. Considerations of collective identity—whether articulated along national, ethnic, linguistic, gender, or other lines—and demands for recognition are increasingly displacing vocabularies of universality, neutrality, and, perhaps most of all, individuality.¹ Political disputes between proponents of individual freedoms and collective interests, or between the requirements of universality and particularity, are in themselves nothing new. What is new is the manner and extent to which the vocabulary of identity,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cn6rz3">Myth, Symbol, and Colonial Encounter</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of thinking and living in the New World began, for the British in Acadia, with a problem of continuity of place. Fundamentally, theirs was the problem of imagining continuity where there was none. Complicating the issue, however, was the fact that a great many British settlers were possessed of a sense of identity that had been in some measure disfigured and that they were consequently trying to recover. In most cases, the identity that they sought to preserve was of British origin.<br>

  Abstract: Why is it that the British colonial language of inclusion (paternalistic and morally degrading though it was) was at such variance with colonial practice? The answer may lie in the British assertion of cultural purity that sought to create the colonial human being and Acadia itself, and that, paradoxically, constituted the foundation of calls for the civilization of aboriginal peoples. The claim to be firmly British was clearly problematic. These peoples’ European identity had been transformed in the process of becoming colonials. Western Europeans, for instance, were not scalpers; the British in eighteenth century Acadia were. After announcing in 1749<br>

The lives that revolved around these were encrusted with myths that articulated specific instances of the unity provided by the symbols. In this sense, the religious imagination of all Acadia’s people struggled with the problem of identity and origins in a new world. Yet the problem was resolved in a critically divergent manner by each community so that, overwhelmingly, two distinct visions of human<br>

  Abstract: The importance of Mikhail Bakhtin for literary scholarship does not reside in his often carelessly applied notions of carnival and polyphony. Bakhtin’s primary significance lies in his dialogism, that theory of discourse which enables him to establish, chart, and identify so many of the ways in which literary forms coincide with other diachronic systems of human communication. His theory of discourse is, in fact, an epistemology, even an ontological category (“

  Abstract: A number of Canadian critics—Frank Davey, Bruce Powe, and Paul Stuewe among them—have recently argued that Canadian criticism has reached an impasse. While the thematic criticism which has characterized writing on Canadian literature is acknowledged to have played a necessary part in the articulation of a Canadian literary identity, that criticism has been unable to respond adequately to the formal nature of the texts about which it seeks to speak (as Russell Brown, among others, has argued). As a solution to this impasse, these critics have proposed a re-orientation towards formalism—towards “literature as language and . .<br>

  Abstract: This ethnography explores how Balinese citizens produce postcolonial intimacy-a complex interaction of claims to proximity and mutuality between themselves and the Dutch under colonialism that continues today. Such claims, Ana Dragojlovic explains, are crucial for the diasporic reconfiguration of kebalian, or Balinese-ness, a concept that encompasses the personal, social, and cultural complexities involved in Balinese identity in Dutch postcolonial society. This identity enables Balinese migrants to see themselves as carriers of unique cultural traditions both promoted by and in disagreement with Dutch cultural values.<br>

  Abstract: The imagined ghosts of Native Americans have been an important element of colonial fantasy in North America ever since European settlements were established in the seventeenth century. Native burial grounds and Native ghosts have long played a role in both regional and local folklore and in the national literature of the United States and Canada, as settlers struggled to create a new identity for themselves that melded their European heritage with their new, North American frontier surroundings. In this interdisciplinary volume, Colleen E. Boyd and Coll Thrush bring together scholars from a variety of fields to discuss this North American fascination with "the phantom Native American."<br>

  Author(s) WILLIAMS CATRIN H.<br>
  Abstract: One of the distinctive ways in which John’s Gospel communicates Jesus’ identity as God’s heavenly revealer on earth is by attributing to him a profoundly enigmatic mode of speech. Figurative vocabulary and riddles feature prominently in the discourses of this “stranger from heaven,” not least in the cluster of declarations whose verbal building blocks consist of words to which more than one level of meaning can be ascribed (e.g., John 3:3–4; 4:10–11). among the most well known, and baffling, of these Johannine cases of

And what he has he doesn’t want, and what he wants he doesn’t have. Hans in Schnockeloch has all that he wants.”¹ A pro-German, pro-Nazi folklorist, Karl Roos, popularized this piece of doggerel during the 1920s as part of an anti-French movement.² The expression of ambivalence—simultaneously desiring inclusion and chafing at external control—aptly characterizes Alsatian identity throughout the 1920s, 1930s, and into World War II.<br>

  Book Title: The Rhizomatic West-Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Tatum Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept of the rhizome, Neil Campbell shows how the West (or west-ness) continually breaks away from a mainstream notion of American "rootedness" and renews and transforms itself in various cultural forms. A region long traversed by various transient peoples (from tribes and conquerors to immigrants, traders, and trappers), the West reflects a mythic quest for settlement, permanence, and synthesis-even notions of a national or global identity-at odds with its rootless history, culture, and nature. Crossing the concept of "roots" with "routes," this book shows how notions of the West-in representations ranging from literature and film to photography, music, and architectural theory-give expression to ideas about identity, nationhood, and belonging in a world increasingly defined by movement across time and borders.
      The Rhizomatic Westoffers a new vision of the American West as a hybrid, performative space, a staging place for myriad intersecting and constantly changing identities.<br>

  Book Title: Public Memory in Early China-  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Brashier K. E.<br>
  Abstract: In early imperial China, the dead were remembered by stereotyping them, by relating them to the existing public memory and not by vaunting what made each person individually distinct and extraordinary in his or her lifetime. Their posthumous names were chosen from a limited predetermined pool; their descriptors were derived from set phrases in the classical tradition; and their identities were explicitly categorized as being like this cultural hero or that sage official in antiquity. In other words, postmortem remembrance was a process of pouring new ancestors into prefabricated molds or stamping them with rigid cookie cutters. Public Memory in Early China is an examination of this pouring and stamping process. After surveying ways in which learning in the early imperial period relied upon memorization and recitation, K. E. Brashier treats three definitive parameters of identity—name, age, and kinship—as ways of negotiating a person’s relative position within the collective consciousness. He then examines both the tangible and intangible media responsible for keeping that defined identity welded into the infrastructure of Han public memory.<br>

  Abstract: Dubisch examines in detail the process of pilgrimage itself, its relationship to Orthodox belief and practice, the motivations and behavior of pilgrims, the relationship between religion and Greek national identity, and the gendered nature of religious roles.

  VI  The Celebration of Community in a Changing World from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1dxg8pg">Firewalking and Religious Healing</a><br>
  Abstract: The Anastenaria not only plays an important part in the personal lives of individual Anastenarides, it also plays a central role in the collective life of the village of Ayia Eleni and the community of Kostilides as a whole. The Anastenaria has been a powerful symbol for the shared identity of the Kostilides ever since their arrival as refugees in Greek Macedonia. It epitomizes all that it means to be a Kostilis in a society that is experiencing the homogenizing effects of mass media, a national educational system, and rapid modernization and urbanization. In addition, the festival of Saints Constantine<br>

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal a political gap at the heart of the universal itself.<br>

  Book Title: Inca Garcilaso and Contemporary World-Making-  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Fernández Christian<br>
  Abstract: This edited volume offers new perspectives from leading scholars on the important work of Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (1539-1616), one of the first Latin American writers to present an intellectual analysis of pre-Columbian history and culture and the ensuing colonial period. To the contributors, Inca Garcilaso's
      Royal Commentaries of the Incaspresented an early counter-hegemonic discourse and a reframing of the history of native non-alphabetic cultures that undermined the colonial rhetoric of his time and the geopolitical divisions it purported. Through his research in both Andean and Renaissance archives, Inca Garcilaso sought to connect these divergent cultures into one world.This collection offers five classical studies ofRoyal Commentariespreviously unavailable in English, along with seven new essays that cover topics including Andean memory, historiography, translation, philosophy, trauma, and ethnic identity. This cross-disciplinary volume will be of interest to students and scholars of Latin American history, culture, comparative literature, subaltern studies, and works in translation.<br>

  Abstract: Every form of cultural identity is inauthentic, a kind of imposture. But because of the circumstances of Spanish colonialism, Latin American cultural identity is perhaps especially so. I am far from having the scholarly authority to speak about Inca Garcilaso de la Vega or his work. At best, I know it superficially. But I know enough to at least suggest that Garcilaso might be said to be the founding moment of that Latin American cultural in authenticity. To celebrate the anniversary of

  Abstract: What is a Continental philosophy of religion?¹ Philosophy of religion, in English-speaking countries, has a clear and distinct identity, and has been enjoying a resurgence: it focuses largely on the truth-claims, rationality, and coherence of religious propositions, and particularly those of “classical theism.”² Yet for those who work in the traditions of philosophy derived from Germany and France, the problems, tasks, concepts, reasoning, and cultural location are markedly different from this identity. When even the individual terms of the phrase “Continental philosophy of religion” are highly contestable, can this title designate any determinate field? In spite of its weaknesses, this<br>

  Book Title: An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): PAPADATOS YIANNIS<br>
  Abstract: In the long tradition of the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean bodies have held a prominent role in the form of figurines, frescos, or skeletal remains, and have even been responsible for sparking captivating portrayals of the Mother-Goddess cult, the elegant women of Minoan Crete or the deeds of heroic men. Growing literature on the archaeology and anthropology of the body has raised awareness about the dynamic and multifaceted role of the body in experiencing the world and in the construction, performance and negotiation of social identity. In these 28 thematically arranged papers, specialists in the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean confront the perceived invisibility of past bodies and ask new research questions. Contributors discuss new and old evidence; they examine how bodies intersect with the material world, and explore the role of body-situated experiences in creating distinct social and other identities. Papers range chronologically from the Palaeolithic to the Early Iron Age and cover the geographical regions of the Aegean, Cyprus and the Near East. They highlight the new possibilities that emerge for the interpretation of the prehistoric eastern Mediterranean through a combined use of body-focused methodological and theoretical perspectives that are nevertheless grounded in the archaeological record.<br>

  Author(s) Fox Sherry C.<br>
  Abstract: Mimesisis the imitation of nature and life in art or literature. According to Plato, all art is mimetic of life and therefore a reflection of reality. This theory has spawned an entire philosophy and study of art and the nature of reality and identity (i.e.Potolsky 2006, Halliwell 2009 — for a prehistoric example see Borić 2007). If art does indeed reflect reality, then this could present a window into the past, representing either ideal images for a particular period or specific individuals. In some cases, it is possible to observe the integration of a specific biological phenomenon into artistic<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1ggjkqm">An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean</a><br>
  Author(s) Goula Dimitra<br>
  Abstract: Painted motifs on Cycladic folded-arm figurines (FAFs hereafter) have been considered as representations of body ornamentation that reflected social identity and status (Broodbank 1992, 543–5; 2000, 247–75; Carter 2008, 120–1; Sherratt 2000, 134; Hoffman 2002, 532–4). This paper aims to formulate some thoughts concerning possible meanings of the FAFs deposited in burial contexts.

  Abstract: This paper focuses on the fact that picrolite, an indigenous stone that was extensively used during the Chalcolithic period (4000/3900–2500/2400 BC) for the manufacture of small figurines and other symbolic artefacts, was used in the Early and Middle Cypriot periods (2400–1700 BC) for the production of pendants in new forms. Although the relatively limited number and contextual information available for Bronze Age objects leaves little opportunity to consider in detail how they were perceived by their makers and wearers, they can nevertheless be used to give insights into their significance and the way in which they embodied identity<br>

  Author(s) Lorentz Kirsi O.<br>
  Abstract: Archaeologists have attempted to study identity through several different avenues and varied archaeological remains (see

More recently, some bioarchaeologists have begun to attempt social interpretations of the physical anthropological and palaeopathological data they produce (Agarwal and Glencross 2011; Gowland and Knüsel 2006), focusing on identity issues. Grasping for identity through archaeological human remains is a challenging endeavour as, for example, papers in the edited volume by Gowland and Knüsel illustrate (2006, see specifically Le Hurayet al.2006; Montgomery and Evans 2006).

  Abstract: Human skeletal data are presented in this chapter within the context of the archaeological data from the site of Tell Nader in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq to help elucidate long-standing questions of cultural dynamics. In particular, a form of circumferential headshaping has been found in the skeleton of an adult female recovered from the Ubaid site. It is suggested from the integrated results of the study of the human remains in their cultural context that the intentionally produced modification of the cranium recovered from the archaeological site of Tell Nader is linked to group identity in the Ubaid.<br>

  Abstract: The relationship with the past is one of the most fraught aspects in the negotiation of a postcolonial identity, and indeed history is frequently figured in postcolonial writing as a restraining or a restrictive force. For Joyce’s Stephen Dedalus history, famously, is the nightmare from which he wants to awake, while Salman Rushdie’s Saleem Sinai describes himself as being ‘handcuffed to history’ on the opening page of
                  Midnight’s Children. Such images of entrapment or restraint testify to the oppressive ‘presentness’ of the past in the postcolonial imaginary. As we have already seen, in the context of the Caribbean – where<br>

  Book Title: Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fiction-Explorations in Readers' Engagement with Characters<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): CARACCIOLO MARCO<br>
  Abstract: A storyteller's craft can often be judged by how convincingly the narrative captures the identity and personality of its characters. In this book, the characters who take center stage are "strange" first-person narrators: they are fascinating because of how they are at odds with what the reader would wish or expect to hear-while remaining reassuringly familiar in voice, interactions, and conversations. Combining literary analysis with research in cognitive and social psychology, Marco Caracciolo focuses on readers' encounters with the "strange" narrators of ten contemporary novels, including Bret Easton Ellis's
      American Psycho, Haruki Murakami'sHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, and Mark Haddon'sThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. Caracciolo explores readers' responses to narrators who suffer from neurocognitive or developmental disorders, who are mentally disturbed due to multiple personality disorder or psychopathy, whose consciousness is split between two parallel dimensions or is disembodied, who are animals, or who lose their sanity.A foray into current work on reception, reader-response, cognitive literary study, and narratology,Strange Narrators in Contemporary Fictionillustrates why any encounter with a fictional text is a complex negotiation of interlaced feelings, thoughts, experiences, and interpretations.<br>

  Abstract: Theodor W. Adorno’s preoccupation with language is gleaned from the context of his theory of knowledge, particularly his critique of identity thinking. He tackles the problem of conceptual reification genealogically, that is, he traces conceptual reification via an analysis of the structure of language. My aim in this paper is to argue that Adorno’s engagement with the nature of language is informed by an implicit attempt at a revaluation of the language of philosophy, a revaluation that has significant consequences for a global understanding of how we conceive the world of objects, in general, and how philosophy’s configurative use of<br>

The ontological emphasis on a relational con ception of reality plays a particularly important role in helping define the black community as something distinct from the European community of slaveholders.

Thus, as in the caribbean, black philosophy in north America—at least that north American tradition we highlight here—works with the generative themes of the African philosophical tradition in ways that stress the importance of community in preserving and refiguring identity.

However, this does not mean that our explanation of human nature and of the human person need be involved or complicated. In fact, anthropology seeks above all a once-off, simple, unitary, integrated explanation of human identity. The search for truth, in fact, is always a search for unity, for simplicity, for harmony, for coherence. In other words, in order to<br>

Heaney has spoken a lot about complex structures of meaning and identity, and he has stressed the importance of plurality and influence in his thinking, and in his writing. We have seen his political amphibiousness as well as his displacement and dislocation of foundational attachments to place. We have also seen that he is keen to use the aesthetic as a tool<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1j1w050">Memory Ireland</a><br>
  Author(s) THUENTE MARY HELEN<br>
  Abstract: The harp image encompasses distinct and sometimes conflicting iconographical histories and cultural “memories” that influenced the complex formation of Irish identity. Long recognized as an iconic site of Irish identity, the harp is also a palimpsest of cultural memory. The origins of the harp icon’s meanings extend well beyond Ireland and can be traced to a variety of ancient and modern sources, in fact and in cultural memory.

  Author(s) CREGAN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: Mainstream public memory is traditionally understood as an intentional recollection of quantifiable facts of the historical past that then constitute collective identity. Because of its suppressed nature, queer memory is flimsier: while mainstream public memory is solidly supported institutionally by politics and history, queer memory is more symbolic, derived from what is implied by exclusion rather than inclusion. By uncovering previously hidden gay and lesbian experiences, queer historians have initiated a type of cultural rebellion, juxtaposing queer memory with hetero-normative histories. The production of this alternative history has evoked a renewed engagement with memory because more traditional methodological approaches to<br>

  Abstract: As Rosemarie Garland-Thomson writes, “Seeing disability as a representational system engages several premises of current critical theory: that representation structures reality, that the margins constitute the center, that human identity is multiple and unstable, and that all analysis and evaluation has political implications” (1997b, 19). With this in mind, I will pause here to create a quick overview of some of the myths of disability that are ubiquitous across cultures and eras and that condition our understanding of disability (and thus of all identity and all bodies).

  Abstract: Throughout my interpretation of Levinas I have been opposing the interpretation that takes his thought to be a moral philosophy. Such a reading is ubiquitous in the literature. The I is a subject, under this view, enjoying itself selfishly until it meets another person, the “other” who breaks into my closed realm, decenters me, but also gives me a new (moral) identity deeper and more fulfilling than before.

More particularly, Christian love—agapein the most frequently employed New Testament designation—marks a quality of character, a theological virtue, one incorporating precisely an agent’s disposition to sacrifice the interests of the self for the good of the neighbor, whatever else such love may say about the identity of the neighbor or the nature of the good in question.¹ Note especially that in this account, the relation between agape and self-sacrifice isessentialrather than accidental,necessaryrather than contingent,intrinsic<br>

  1  Introduction and History of Interpretation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1kgqv1h">Memories of Asaph</a><br>
  Abstract: The biblical psalms attributed to Asaph (Psalms 50, 73–83) exhibit the most concentrated collection of historical referents in the Psalter. These historical referents, embodied in the Asaphite collection, serve as the marshals of Israel’s historical memory and establish a cultic framework in which Israel’s memory is formed, its history represented, and its identity shaped. My contention is that the historical material in these psalms, paired as it is with a broad vocabulary of remembrance, is a form of cultic historiography that is principally attested in Asaph and is distinctive of the Psalter.<br>

How to explain and explore the evolving new era as it hurtled toward decolonization, overturning the long-standing colonizer-colonized dynamic, fostered questions about identity in the burgeoning freed nation that would become postcolonial Algeria in the early 1960s.

  Abstract: Following Freud, Lacan questions the Cartesian identification of our conscious mental processes with our identity as a “self” (
                  cogito ergo sum). Going somewhat beyond Freud, he suggests too that the language in which we can express the existence of self is also the condition of our alienation from self. The processes of substitution implied in language make civilized life possible, but at the cost of our alienation from the primary “knowledge” of ourselves hidden in the unconscious.¹ Language is itself part of a series of absences through which the unconscious leaves its mark.

  Abstract: Ireland in the Celtic Tiger years saw an unprecedented influx of ethnically diverse migrants to a nation formerly perceived as comparatively monocultural. Sketching the two dominant representations of post-Celtic Tiger multiculturalism, Amanda Tucker notes that the first of these ‘emphasizes that fear and hostility continue to characterize Irish responses to inward migration since the Gaelic Catholic monolith remains’ at the heart of twenty-first-century Irish identity, thus reinforcing ‘the idea of Ireland as a monocultural rather than multicultural society’ (Tucker, 2010: 107).¹ The second type of response claims that, despite the legal situation of immigrants, Ireland is a country traditionally open<br>

  Abstract: At the height of the Irish economic boom on St. Patrick’s Day 2007, the

Confident, wealthy, forward-looking, internationalist, we can afford to define our identity in terms that celebrate our overlapping multiplicity of allegiances and diversity’ (Anon., 2007). In its allusion to Hugo Hamilton’s memoirThe Speckled People(2003), the newspaper envisioned the author as the embodiment of a culturally diverse, inclusive, modern Irish nation. Its emphasis on the affordability of a more fluid and plural form of identity was obviously short-sighted in light of Ireland’s subsequent economic collapse,<br>

  Abstract: There is a history of Irish empathy for black people. It can be argued that a key component in the construction of Irish political and cultural identity is the practice of emotion of ‘feeling with’ and standing in the same place with black Others. From the end of the eighteenth century we can see the articulation of Irish national identity being formulated (at least partially if not centrally) in terms of an ability to share in and hence represent the political and cultural sufferings and triumphs of the racialised Other. The location and ethnic identity of these Others fluctuates over<br>

It starts with the perhaps by now familiar cyberromanticism narrative of how the Internet created new romantic spaces and opportunities for romantic-Platonic escape; how romantic machines were developed that were more human, more personal, more beautiful—machines that more than ever before enabled one to escape to Wonderland and shape one’s identity. But I also go further than most of the other literature in the cyberromanticism field and make new claims that take into account our contemporary, early<br>

In the meantime, I just wanted to point out something I’m sure you’ve noticed even when I haven’t mentioned it: namely, that each of these approaches to identity has a history in two chapters.

  Book Title: Whose Freud?-The Place of Psychoanalysis in Contemporary Culture<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Woloch Alex<br>
  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Abstract: This section considers the role of psychoanalysis in posing the question of sexual identity: a question crucial to psychoanalysis, but also one in which Freud’s own views have been most open to attack. Paul Robinson, an intellectual historian, begins by showing how an ambivalent or vacillating perspective toward homosexuality—within Freud’s own work—generates various perspectives on sexual desire and social norms in twentieth-century psychoanalytic thought. On one hand, as Robinson claims, “no one has done more to destabilize the notion of heterosexuality than Freud.” For Freud, the “homosexual object choice” is present in

He included in this searching both grace and psychology and he saw that these could work together, sometimes being in conflict. Merton was searching for full identity in Christ and for what spiritual maturity might mean, and from glimpses of his work the suggestion in this book is that he<br>

  Abstract: As the Lebanese civil war was drawing to a close, various Salafi groups began incorporating the country’s Palestinian camps into their religious networks. That they were so quickly successful bears witness to the failure of the PLO’s political socialization tools within the camp. Several factors explain this dynamic. First, Salafism offered a new intellectual horizon to its partisans, allowing those who had not personally experienced the Palestinian nationalist struggle to look beyond their geographical, legal, and political restrictions as “Palestinian refugees” in Lebanon. Salafism offered a new religious identity and new possibilities for action severed from a Palestinian cause that<br>

  Book Title: Faces of Displacement-The Writings of Volodymyr Vynnychenko<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): SOROKA MYKOLA<br>
  Abstract: "Whom do our people read? Vynnychenko. Whom do people talk about if it concerns literature? Vynnychenko. Whom do they buy? Again, Vynnychenko." So wrote Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky about the young Volodymyr Vynnychenko. An innovative and provocative writer, Vynnychenko was also a charismatic revolutionary and politician who responded to the dramatic upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century by challenging old values and bringing forward new ideas about human relationships. Despite his inseparable association with Ukraine, what is often overlooked is the fact that Vynnychenko wrote the majority of his works outside his native land following his flight from Tsarist and Soviet tyranny. In this ground-breaking study, Mykola Soroka draws on contemporary theories of displacement to show how Vynnychenko's expatriate status determined his worldview, his choice of literary devices, and his attitudes toward his homeland and hostlands. Soroka considers concepts of identity to study the intertwined experiences of the writer - as an exile, émigré, expatriate, traveler, and nomad - and to demonstrate how these experiences invigorated his art and left a lasting impact on his work. The first book-length study in English on Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Faces of Displacement is an insightful examination of an exiled writer that sheds new light on the challenges faced by the displaced.<br>

  Abstract: The principal point of this study is that all forms of displacement – exile, émigré, expatriate, travel, nomadism, emigration, and diaspora – are not isolated and may overlap. This pluralistic approach may reveal the dominance of one form of displacement over another or their collisions in shaping the identity of displaced writers, alongside other undercurrents of influence such as historical time, geographical place, and the writer’s own personal characteristics. Viewing different forms of displacement in the historical continuum, we can see how they change with the social progress of civilization. “A hundred years ago,” says Czeslaw Milosz, “average people not familiar with<br>

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects.

  Abstract: In an essay (translated here for the first time in English) that has been pivotal to the understanding of the history of electronic arts, Raymond Bellour shows how video art’s specific contribution to the realm of moving images lies in its unique deployment of the self-portrait. With video, argues Bellour, the image becomes a site of representation and interpellation of the self – but a self whose identity is more a question or an open-ended project than a definition or a clear determination. The relevance of this text to precarious visuality is indisputable: it discloses a visual writing of the “I”<br>

  Abstract: Over the last decade, contemporary art in Hong Kong, informed by travel(ing) theory, the special administrative region’s ambiguous (post) colonial-national-global connections and its inimitable set of historical and cultural situations, has been preoccupied with the themes of mobility, transition, and location in its representations of the city. This fixation, or, rather, the urgency of its mediation in not only artistic but also cultural, economic, and political arenas is inextricably linked to an ongoing elaboration of a Hong Kong identity.

  Abstract: Motherhood is an identity common to women in all societies, but the expression of it varies greatly both within and across social groups. Mothering emerges from the intersection of a woman’s personality, her life experiences, and choices available to her, and is embedded in gender role expectations shaped by religion, culture, and historical context. Every woman constructs her own expression of motherhood through a process of accepting and resisting role expectations. The process of establishing individual motherhood priorities may be covert or overt—likely influenced by the consequences of the choices. Thus the social construction of motherhood is dynamic and<br>

  Author(s) MARTIN BETTY ANN<br>
  Abstract: Noted anthropologist clifford geertz defines culture as “the ensemble of stories we tell ourselves about ourselves” (448). In keeping with this theory, Fred Inglis suggests that identity is formed through a process whereby we observe and “inhabit the narratives of how to live” available within a given culture (“Culture and Sentiment” 2). Such narratives generally reflect the dominant discourse and accepted range of meanings in relation to socially defined roles. In terms of the negotiated meaning of motherhood, however, there is a growing tension between competing narratives and representations that highlight the juxtaposition between culturally constructed fantasies of maternal perfection<br>

  TWO  Conceptualising, theorising and narrating retirement migration from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t896fb">Retiring to Spain</a><br>
  Abstract: The focus of this chapter is on how I gain knowledge of the processes involved in constructing shifting and overlapping forms of belonging to different kinds of community and how this illuminates experiences of retirement migration. I begin by presenting a discussion of my conceptualisation of retirement migration and then unravel my approach to theory, explaining how women’s experiences and agency are placed within wider structural contexts. I explore how understanding of retirement migration is gained through a thematic and structural narrative analytic approach centring on plot, time, identity or positionality and an analysis of linguistic devices employed.

  Book Title: Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age-  Publisher: Policy Press<br>
  Author(s): Gilleard Chris<br>
  Abstract: How do we sustain agency and identity amidst the frailty of advanced old age? What role does care play in this process? Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by age and infirmity. It begins with a theoretical examination of the fourth age, interrogating notions of agency, identity and personhood, as well as the impact of frailty, abjection and ‘othering’. It then applies this analysis to issues of care. Exploring our collective hopes and fears concerning old age and the ends of people’s lives, this is essential reading on one of the biggest social issues of our time.Pushing forward new sociological theory, this book explores the theoretical and practical issues raised by ageing, and the associated problems of mental and physical frailty in later life.<br>

  TWO  Interrogating personhood from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89766">Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age</a><br>
  Abstract: The fourth age imaginary embodies fears of dependency, frailty and the gradual loss of our sense of agency, identity and our status as persons. This fear, particularly as it is represented in the fear of ‘losing one’s mind’ or of developing Alzheimer’s, brings to the fore questions of agency, identity and personhood. When we first wrote about the fourth age, we described it as ‘ageing without agency’ (Gilleard and Higgs, 2010), treating mental decline as a decline in ‘agency’. By so doing we wanted to acknowledge how closely allied fears are of an unwanted old age with fears of losing<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89766">Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age</a><br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter we outlined the various ways that terms like ‘agency’, ‘identity’ and ‘personhood’ have been understood within philosophy, and how such understandings have been applied particularly in response to the problems of mental infirmity in later life. We argued that the de-construction of the term ‘person’ into the separable issues of agency and identity may provide a more useful framework through which to interpret these problems than by approaches based on the more generic term ‘personhood’. Irrespective of their ‘powers’ to express agency and identity, the common humanity of people with infirmities can serve as the underlying<br>

  Abstract: The emergence of what has been called a ‘hyper-cognitive’ society (Post, 1995) and its structural individualisation (Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002) has made the body a key site of identity and embodied difference. The ‘corporeal capital’ that could be said to be associated with owning a fit body has become a critical resource throughout life (Higgs, 2012). In later life, being fit and healthy enables effective participation in the cultures of the third age, and serves as a key point of reference for older people in judging how well they are doing and how effectively they are managing to age at<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1t89766">Personhood, identity and care in advanced old age</a><br>
  Abstract: We began this book by outlining our formulation of the fourth age as the cultural reconfiguration of all those aspects of old age that are most associated with fear and disgust. Such a social imaginary, we argued, draws on past and present representations of age as frailty, abjection and loss. The feared loss of agency, identity and independence that constitutes a pervasive element of this social imaginary is now centred on age-associated mental decline linked to ‘Alzheimer’s disease’ (Cutler, 2015). To provide a fuller context to the representation of this anticipated ‘loss’ within the fourth age’s social imaginary, we reviewed<br>

  Author(s) Bar-On Daniel<br>
  Abstract: The Holocaust did not only divide humanity into survivors, bystanders, perpetrators and rescuers and define generations as first, second and third generations of each category. The Holocaust also reinforced perspectives that became associated with the construction of collective memory, especially in countries where society identified itself, or was identified by, these categories, specifically Israel and Germany. ‘Who was a Holocaust survivor?’ was determined first legally and then historically (Gutman, 1990). In Israel, this identity became an important issue in terms of social labelling in the 1950s, and later became salient in terms of self-chosen categorisation in the 1980s and 1990s<br>

  Abstract: At the time of writing in the summer of 2016, 1,900 neighbourhood plans were under way across England, and more than 200 had passed referendum and were being used to help make development decisions (Planning Aid England, 2016). A movement of citizen-planners had responded with pragmatic enthusiasm to the conditional and much-circumscribed opportunity to influence the look and feel of their communities. In no other case study of devolution, across a broad international canvas, do we see so vividly the liberatory and regulatory conflicts that arise from the assemblages of localism, or the tangled relations of power and identity that<br>

  Abstract: The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

The ethnic identity of these urban Hui and the expression of that identity, however, is different from the northwestern Hui Muslim communities and the dispersed southeastern Hui lineages in many aspects.

  Abstract: Although James Baldwin’s essays depict the relationship of white supremacy to the formation of American society and the shaping of national identity, prevailing forms of liberal and Marxist political thought, as well as most versions of so-called democratic theory, do not recognize him as a political thinker or even contributing to the understanding of politics. Their resounding silence about race, and his exclusion from their canons, bespeak the very conditions he analyzes as a political and moral catastrophe. These conditions are, in short, ongoing racial domination as the foundation of American life, and its disavowal by those it enfranchises. On<br>

Or one might feel inclined to contend that his version of a radical humanism is particularly useful for postidentity politics at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Another possibility for confronting the question of Baldwin’s legacy would be to call attention to his understanding of the function of the writer as a public intellectual.

                  instructors. Too often we assume instructors of college composition classes are universally middle-and upper-class individuals who must be attentive to the needs of their working-class students.

  Abstract: The educational impact of poverty on working-class students often goes unexamined in disciplinary conversations about composition pedagogy and theory. This elision reflects a long-standing national rhetoric that simplifies interactions between social classes and hails a middle-class identity so persuasively that most Americans self-identify as middle class, regardless of their economic bracket, material affordances, or social interests.² As a result, narratives about education and social uplift tend to obscure many of the lived realities of students experiencing poverty.³ In first-year composition courses, where many students first encounter the linguistic and cultural expectations of a middle-class professoriate, examining the relationships between class<br>

  Abstract: Though the choice of 1990 as a watershed year demarcating ‘old’ Ireland from ‘new’, modern, Ireland may be a convenient simplification that ignores or plays down a slow, complex, ongoing process, it is nonetheless true to say that in recent years Ireland has undergone something of a revolution. Economic success, the so-called ‘Celtic Tiger’ phenomenon, and its attendant socio-political consequences, has given the country a new confidence whilst challenging or eroding the old markers of Irish identity.

  Abstract: Feminist criticism frequently employs metaphors of space to interrogate the position of women within society and their ability to articulate that position to a wider world. The idea of ‘clearing a space’ from which to speak suggests that for women freedom of expression can only be achieved in ‘empty’ space, space that is unmarked by ideological and aesthetic convictions. Yet such emptiness is impossible, since the speaking self must be meaningfully located. Space, both public and private, is closely related to the construction of identity and to its textual representation. This chapter examines the representation of the house by two<br>

  Book Title: Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticity-The Ethics of Theatricality in Kant, Kierkegaard, and Levinas<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): PICKETT HOWARD<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on the writings of Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, and Emmanuel Levinas, Howard Pickett presents a vivid defense of "virtuous hypocrisy." Our fetish for transparency tends to allow us to forget that the self may not be worthy of expression, and may become unethically narcissistic in the act of expression. Alert to this ambivalence, these great thinkers advocate incongruent ways of being.
      Rethinking Sincerity and Authenticityoffers an engaging new appraisal not only of the ethics of theatricality but of the theatricality of ethics, contending that pursuit of one's ideal self entails a relational and ironic performance of identity that lies beyond the pure notion of expressive individualism.<br>

  Abstract: Like Du Bellay’s

Critics from the Florentine Accademia della Crusca had violently attacked theGerusalemme Liberata, arguing that it was inferior in style and content to Ariosto’sOrlando Furioso.¹ To defend himself, Tasso had to prove the superiority of his Christian epic to Ariosto’s poem, which was, in Tasso’s view, ethically and aesthetically confused, an “animal of uncertain nature.”² Basically, Tasso defines the difference between his and Ariosto’s poems in terms of a<br>

The Western world was entering postmodernity, characterized by its fractured and liquid quality,¹ aptly characterized as an age of fracture, with the construct of woman being profoundly affected.

It is social death that enables us to distinguish the peculiar evil of genocide from the evils of other mass murders. Even genocidal murders can be viewed as extreme means to the primary end of social death. Social vitality exists through relationships, contemporary and intergenerational, that create an identity that gives meaning to a life. Major loss of social vitality is a loss of identity and<br>

First, the essential characteristics of narrative are partly obscured by the distinct inflections given it by the different media through which it manifests itself. Dramatic narrative is phenomenally immediate, realized by characters and settings both visually and audibly present. Literary narrative is likewise relatively specific with respect to character and setting, but is constructed through verbal description and dialogue. Mythic narrative invokes characters, settings, and/or themes with numinous cultural significance, situating these elements in an idealized, hyper-real manner. Historical narrative ostensibly employs real events and characters<br>

  Book Title: The War of 1948-Representations of Israeli and Palestinian Memories and Narratives<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kadish Alon<br>
  Abstract: The 1948 War is remembered in this special volume, including aspects of Israeli-Jewish memory and historical narratives of 1948 and representations of Israeli-Palestinian memory of that cataclysmic event and its consequences. The contributors map and analyze a range of perspectives of the 1948 War as represented in literature, historical museums, art, visual media, and landscape, as well as in competing official and societal narratives. They are examined especially against the backdrop of the Oslo process, which brought into relief tensions within and between both sides of the national divide concerning identity and legitimacy, justice, and righteousness of "self" and "other."<br>

  Abstract: This volume consists of a collection of studies of Israeli representations, both Jewish and Palestinian, of memory and historical narratives of the 1948 War. The studies map and explain some Israeli-Jewish and Israeli-Palestinian perspectives of the 1948 War as represented in literature, historical museums, art, visual media, and landscape, as well as in competing official and societal narratives.

  Book Title: Feminist Phenomenology Futures-  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): OLKOWSKI DOROTHEA E.<br>
  Abstract: Distinguished feminist philosophers consider the future of their field and chart its political and ethical course in this forward-looking volume. Engaging with themes such as the historical trajectory of feminist phenomenology, ways of perceiving and making sense of the contemporary world, and the feminist body in health and ethics, these essays affirm the base of the discipline as well as open new theoretical spaces for work that bridges bioethics, social identity, physical ability, and the very nature and boundaries of the female body. Entanglements with thinkers such as Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Beauvoir, and Arendt are evident and reveal new directions for productive philosophical work. Grounded in the richness of the feminist philosophical tradition, this work represents a significant opening to the possible futures of feminist phenomenological research.<br>

  Abstract: Thirteen years into the twenty-first century, much of the promise of the postmodern era has begun to materialize for the field of architecture. Technology has caught up with imagination, and our tolerance for evanescence, contingency, and multiplicity has found consonances in a world of informatics and bioengineering that transgress old boundaries of form, order, and identity. In the field of architecture, the chaotic character of earlier decades (when we drew sharp angles with dissonant relationships to show that we were no longer seeking a singular truth) is morphing into an appreciation and understanding of deep pattern.

  Abstract: The enemy—red in the past, today green—is at our door. Ready to overcome us. On the verge of subverting our society and of perverting our way of life—of subjugating our civilization. In the 1930s, the enemy sought to “Sovietize” France, to take power, to impose Soviets, and to destroy our colonial empire; in the early twenty-first century, the enemy intends to “Islamize” our country, destroy our “national identity,” wage international jihad, destroy Israel.

  Author(s) Liogier Raphaël<br>
  Abstract: The overused notion of “populism” should not be conflated with the term bandied about by politicians who say what they think voters want to hear. Nor is populism related to popular preoccupations, those of artisans, fishermen, workers, hunters, farmers, engineers, doctors, the rich, or the poor. In the enthusiasm surrounding populism, concrete categories within the population—professions, at times contradictory interests, class distinctions—tend to be elided over in favor of a fiction of an all encompassing, omnipresent, and omniscient people, who are believed to have a single soul and unified identity. Populists can be either Marxist, like Stalin, or<br>

This conflict is exemplified by the #GamerGate controversy, which exploded in the gamer community in August 2014, either in response to a lack of journalistic ethics or because of an undercurrent of vicious misogyny in gaming, depending on whom you ask. Among other things, it was an attempt to police the borders of gamer identity in the face of changing demographics and complementary erosions of<br>

  Abstract: Childhood stories in personal narratives of Western subjects often convey pivotal moments of experience aimed at communicating personal identity. Such strategies rely on cultural models that see identity as the product of past life events, with childhood experience especially important. But what do personal childhood stories reveal in societies with very different cultural models of early lifeʹs role in shaping identity? Among the Bumbita Arapesh of Papua New Guinea—a group bordering the Ilahita Arapesh—childhood is the time of life when a new growing being takes in essential life substance from parental nurturing, supplemented by ritual transformation in initiation<br>

  Abstract: At the end of a survey covering more than a millenium, from Archaic Greece to the Late Roman Empire, ancient rhetoric appears simultaneously various and unified. It is various because it functioned in very diverse circumstances—in a Hellenic and in a Roman milieu, in Greek and in Latin, in democracies, aristocracies, and monarchies—and changed its fashions to suit each circumstance. And yet it is unified, because in this diversity of situations it constructed and preserved a fundamental identity. The components of this identity, or, to put it differently, the essential elements of a definition of ancient rhetoric, can<br>

  Abstract: It is not at all easy to free human awareness from the captivating idea that the human being can account for his own existence without coming to terms with the question of his own origin. The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

However, after his death and resurrection, and with the coming of the Holy Spirit, full Christian faith in him begins.

  Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the nexus between language, space and identity.¹ It does so by focusing on the frequent use of orientational or deictic words in Buli language and relating it to the processes of identification. Spatial deixis seems to be relevant to the processes of identification at two levels: those of individual subjectivity on the one hand and those of cultural identity and differentiation on the other.

Unlike Marcel and Ricœur, however, (authentic) Lévinassian time is not conceived in terms of presence, but is absolutely Other. Rather than justifying a totalizing return to the Self, Lévinas believes that the paradoxes of (temporal) identity bear witness to a time that simply cannot — and therefore should not — be resolved.

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir directors push beyond the earlier genre's limitations and open new paths of cinematic and philosophical exploration.<br>

  Abstract: In his

In particular, he holds that our conscious memories constitute our identities.¹ Christopher Nolan’sMemento(2000) tests this theory of personal identity. In the film, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an insurance investigator from San Francisco, suffers shortterm memory loss as a result of an assault on his wife, Catherine (Jorja Fox), and himself. But now, without his memories, he can hardly function. He insists that his attackers have destroyed his ability to live. Leonard asks: “How can I heal if I cannot feel time?” The question<br>

  Problems of Memory and Identity in Neo-Noir’s Existentialist Antihero from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2jcts3">The Philosophy of Neo-Noir</a><br>
  Author(s) Spicer Andrew<br>
  Abstract: One of the most arresting traits of film noir is its depiction of male protagonists who lack the qualities (courage, incorruptibility, tenacity, and dynamism) that characterize the archetypal American hero and who therefore function as antiheroes. Typical noir male protagonists are weak, confused, unstable, and ineffectual, damaged men who suffer from a range of psychological neuroses and who are unable to resolve the problems they face. Noir’s depiction of its male protagonists—what Frank Krutnik calls its “pervasive problematising of masculine identity”—is expressive of a fundamentally existentialist view of life.¹ As Robert Porfirio argues, noir’s “nonheroic hero” is such<br>

DuBois’s focus on the manner in which Afri-US (Negro) identity, citizenship, and social life were experienced as divided, antagonized, and marginal serves as a model for a new American urban sensibility.

  Abstract: The contributors to this inspiring anthology meet the challenge that everyone faces: that of becoming a whole person in both their personal and professional lives. John C. Haughey, SJ, has gathered twelve professionals in higher education from a variety of disciplines-philosophy, theology, health care, business, and administration. What they have in common reflects the creative understanding of the meaning of "catholic" as Haughey has found it to operate in Catholic higher education. Each essay in the first six chapters describes how its author has assembled a unique whole from within his or her particular area of academic competence. The last six chapters are more autobiographical, with each author describing what has become central to his or her identity. All twelve are "anticipating an entirety" with each contributing a coherence that is as surprising as it is delightful.<br>

Elsewhere, where the seminal events on which collective memories rest are further in the past, the issues involve debating and institutionalizing an appropriate culture of memory and collective identity for future generations.

  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Nylund Anastasia<br>
  Abstract: Narratives are fundamental to our lives: we dream, plan, complain, endorse, entertain, teach, learn, and reminisce through telling stories. They provide hopes, enhance or mitigate disappointments, challenge or support moral order and test out theories of the world at both personal and communal levels. It is because of this deep embedding of narrative in everyday life that its study has become a wide research field including disciplines as diverse as linguistics, literary theory, folklore, clinical psychology, cognitive and developmental psychology, anthropology, sociology, and history. In
      Telling Storiesleading scholars illustrate how narratives build bridges among language, identity, interaction, society, and culture; and they investigate various settings such as therapeutic and medical encounters, educational environments, politics, media, marketing, and public relations. They analyze a variety of topics from the narrative construction of self and identity to the telling of stories in different media and the roles that small and big life stories play in everyday social interactions and institutions. These new reflections on the theory and analysis of narrative offer the latest tools to researchers in the fields of discourse analysis and sociolinguistics.<br>

  Abstract: IN THIS CHAPTER we examine what appears to be a perfect storm related to identity work in social interaction: the use of language alternation in quoting others’ speech in the course of telling conversational, or “small,” stories. Central to language alternation is laying claim to, putting off, or otherwise constructing and negotiating social identities (Torras and Gafaranga 2002). Similarly, identity formation and construction are based in narrative forms and functions (Georgakopoulou 2006; Taylor 2006). Last, identity work is at the core of reported speech (Clift 2006; Stokoe and Edwards 2007). Here we analyze two conversational stories from group interview sessions<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2tt629">Telling Stories</a><br>
  Author(s) COHEN LEOR<br>
  Abstract: THE PURPOSE of this study is to explore how people negotiate their place in the world through the discursive manipulations of identity. A social constructionist perspective is assumed, where identity is constructed online through discourse in social interaction. Constructionism views identity as a dynamic, fluid, multiplicitous construct able to adjust to the demands of the almost infinite array of contexts. Interactional sociolinguistics emerged out of a constructionist framework (De Fina, Schiffrin, and Bamberg 2006, 1–6), where the microanalysis of discourse affords diverse opportunities to uncover that which would otherwise be rationally invisible (Garfinkel 1967, vii; Shotter 1993, 102).

  Abstract: LIFE NARRATIVE RESEARCH in personality psychology has focused on narrative trajectories and on how dispositional traits (what your personality is 
                  usually or typically like) and characteristic adaptations (i.e., more particularized and context-sensitive aspects of one’s personality) are combined to form integrative life stories (McAdams 1985). However, life stories can also go awry. This calls for revisions of assumptions such as continuity. Mishler (2006, 41) argues that the conception of a plurality of subidentities “points to another problem with temporal-order models of progressive change: the tendency to treat identity development as a unitary process, as if each life could be defined<br>

  Abstract: Augustine’s vast literary output encompasses so much, it is inevitable that a particular era’s fascinations bring certain aspects to the fore and leave others less widely known. At least since the Reformation, the intellectual anxiety provoked by Augustine’s doctrine of predestination has led to intensive critical scrutiny of this and related themes, especially in his late, anti-Pelagian writings. It might seem that if the number and identity of the elect have been known since the founding of the universe, and salvation is not in our power but in God’s, then we humans are puppets in the hands of the Lord,¹<br>

  Author(s): Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: It is commonly agreed that we live in an age of globalization, but the profound consequences of this development are rarely understood. Usually, globalization is equated with the expansion of economic and financial markets and the proliferation of global networks of communication. In truth, much more is at stake: Traditional concepts of individual and national identity as well as perceived relationships between the self and others are undergoing profound change. Every town has become a potential cosmopolis -- an international city -- affecting the way that people conceptualize the relationship between public order and political practice.<br>

  Abstract: In chapters 3 and 4, images of the artist have confirmed the profound affinity between masks and metaphors suggested by the introductory chapters on role-playing in photographs, letters, and interviews and also posited by the theoretical chapter.

Faulkner, after all, has made his name as one of the most complex of the high modernists, with an incredible sensitivity for language and an obsession with the sense of place and the role of history in determining human identity and fate.

  Abstract: Modernity—to the degree that it was or is a kind of cultural project or epochal ideology—understands itself as the history of freedom. Or rather, I suppose I should say, the one grand cultural and historical narrative that we as modern persons tend to share, and that most sharply distinguishes a modern from a premodern vision of society, is the story of liberation, the story of the ascent of the individual out of the shadows of hierarchy and subsidiary identity into the light of full recognition, dignity, and autonomy.

  Abstract: In sharp reversal of the monolithic imagination of national identity projected for so long by the culturally levelling discourses of Francoism, Spanishness, for the past two decades, has been actively constructed in terms of multiplicity and synchronicity. Any location of identity thus rests on the historically contingent axes of temporal and spatial parts. In this scattered and fragmented cultural landscape, the modern imagination of nation necessarily cedes to a more ambivalent vision of collective identity, one that allows for a more adept navigation through the disjuncture of postmodernity. Ironically, therefore, this has meant the return to the concept of community.<br>

  Abstract: Issues concerning the concept of community in the context of modernity which were presented in Chapter 1, will be explored in a more specific way in this chapter. My aim here is to problematize community identity by focusing upon key aspects of Julio Llamazares’s prose narratives, attending particularly to 
                  La lluvia amarilla (1988), Luna de lobos (1985), and El río del olvido (1990). Where relevant, I shall also draw upon some of Llamazares’s other works, namely Escenas de cine mudo (1994) and his earlier poetry, La lentitud de los bueyes (1979) and Memoria de la nieve (1982).

  Abstract: This chapter will examine two works by the Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga, 
                  Obabakoak (1988) and El hombre solo (1995), in order to assess their treatment of contemporary Spanish experiences of history and temporality and the subsequent effects on community identity. The previous chapter probed these issues in Llamazares’s work in the context of modernity. My aim here is to intensify the problematization of community in modernity presented in the first chapter through an analysis of Atxaga’s focus on identity in the more recent contexts of post-Francoist Spain. Underlying the key issues which arise in this chapter, therefore, is the postmodern<br>

  Abstract: This chapter aims to examine concepts and narratives of community identities in relation to representations of ethnicity in the film 
                  Alma gitana (Chus Gutiérrez, 1995).¹ This film, which projects a love story between Lucía, a gitana, and Antonio, a payo, ² problematizes ethnic and communal boundaries not just as borders which fence off identity, but also as possible points of crossing.

  Book Title: Art and Its Uses in Thomas Mann's 'Felix Krull'-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Schonfield Ernest<br>
  Abstract: The turn of the twentieth century was a time of identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which increased social mobility caused the blurring of traditional boundaries and created a need for reference works such as the British Who's Who (1897). At the same time, the rise of a new leisure industry and an increase in international travel led to a boom period for confidence men, who frequently operated in hotels and holiday resorts. Thomas Mann's "Felix Krull", written between 1910-13 and continued (though never completed) in 1951-54, uses contemporary accounts of these figures as a starting-point from which to explore the aesthetics of society. The early Krull marks an important stage in Mann's development in a number of respects.In writing it, Mann acquired a more flexible conception of identity and a new understanding of the relation between artist and public. Krull also signals a deeper engagement with Goethe and a shift in Mann's work towards a more open treatment of sexuality. The novel presents art as being central to the development of the individual and to social interaction. While Krull is nominally a confidence man, he is more of a performance artist, a purveyor of beauty who relies upon the complicity of his audience. The later Krull takes up where Mann left off and continues the justification of art as an essential human activity. This study draws upon unpublished material in order to provide a comprehensive reading of "Felix Krull". It examines the novel within the context of Mann's work as a whole, and, in doing so, it seeks to demonstrate the remarkable continuity of Mann's creative achievement.<br>

  Abstract: In his study 
                  The Age of Empire, Eric Hobsbawm describes the period between 1875 and 1914 as a time of profound identity crisis for the upper and middle classes, one in which social mobility reached unprecedented levels.¹ As a result, there arose a confusion about ‘who was who’, and it was in this period that reference volumes about persons of status in the nation, such as the British Who’s Who (1897), first appeared.² The growth of the modern city added to the confusion about identity. As Georg Simmel remarked in his essay ‘Die Großstädte und das Geistesleben’ (1903), the dominance<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter I will argue that the early work on 
                     Felix Krull represents a creative watershed in Mann’s career. It marks the moment when Mann realized that he could imaginatively expand his identity to the extent that he could identify with persons and characters far removed from his own experience and disposition. I will seek to show that Felix Krull offers a creatively adaptable model of identity, and that it presents art and aesthetics as being central to the development of the individual subject.<br>

  Abstract: So far I have considered

I therefore intend to analyse the novel from the point of view of technique, in order to show how the novel’s formal elements reinforce its exploration of art’s contribution to both individual identity and community. Formally, the most remarkable aspect of Krull is the way in which the narrator continually pauses to address the reader. At the heart of this chapter is therefore section (iv), which analyses the<br>

  Abstract: The vocabulary and cadences of Scripture—particularly of the LXX—are imprinted deeply on Paul’s mind, and the great stories of Israel continue to serve for him as a fund of symbols and metaphors that condition his perception of the world, of God’s promised deliverance of his people, and of his own identity and calling. His faith, in short, is one whose articulation is inevitably intertextual in character, and Israel’s Scripture is the “determinate subtext that plays a constitutive role” in shaping his literary production.¹<br>

That is, the French state and questions of national belonging within the republic were always at the heart of these relations.

  Book Title: Aliens and Sojourners-Self as Other in Early Christianity<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DUNNING BENJAMIN H.<br>
  Abstract: Early Christians spoke about themselves as resident aliens, strangers, and sojourners, asserting that otherness is a fundamental part of being Christian. But why did they do so and to what ends? How did Christians' claims to foreign status situate them with respect to each other and to the larger Roman world as the new movement grew and struggled to make sense of its own boundaries?
      Aliens and Sojournersargues that the claim to alien status is not a transparent one. Instead, Benjamin Dunning contends, it shaped a rich, pervasive, variegated discourse of identity in early Christianity. Resident aliens and foreigners had long occupied a conflicted space of both repulsion and desire in ancient thinking. Dunning demonstrates how Christians and others in antiquity capitalized on this tension, refiguring the resident alien as being of a compelling doubleness, simultaneously marginal and potent. Early Christians, he argues, used this refiguration to render Christian identity legible, distinct, and even desirable among the vast range of social and religious identities and practices that proliferated in the ancient Mediterranean. Through close readings of ancient Christian texts such as Hebrews, 1 Peter, theShepherd of Hermas, and theEpistle to Diognetus, Dunning examines the markedly different ways that Christians used the language of their own marginality, articulating a range of options for what it means to be Christian in relation to the Roman social order. His conclusions have implications not only for the study of late antiquity but also for understanding the rhetorics of religious alienation more broadly, both in the ancient world and today.<br>

  Abstract: In the second century, the designation of the Christian as alien and sojourner remained a useful (and indeed prevalent) category for forging and negotiating identity. Scholarship on the topos has tended to treat second-century materials primarily in terms of their relationship to the earlier canonical sources (1 Peter, Hebrews).¹ But Christians in the second century had their own reasons for turning to the alien topos, reasons not primarily (or at least not entirely) determined by earlier texts. Rather, the alien topos proved helpful for these Christians in advancing their own projects of identity formation, bound up as they were in<br>

While numerous texts of the first and second centuries were making exactly this move (as evidenced by our analysis thus far), this was not the only conceptual option available to Christians as they thought about their identity and what its legitimate relationship ought to be to the rhetoric of alienation. Thus there were (perhaps not surprisingly) voices of protest to the increasingly common strategy of constructing the Christian self as other. These voices were not separate or outside the contested discourse of formative Christian identity,<br>

      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Book Title: Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe-  Publisher: Amsterdam University Press<br>
  Author(s): Góis Pedro<br>
  Abstract: Globalisation, migration and integration have shaken up identity processes and identity dynamics as never before. But in a post-colonial, multi-ethnic Europe, what is identity? How is it constructed? Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe endeavours to answer these questions and more. Eleven of the thirteen chapters present empirical case studies from the Basque Country, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Portugal - thus resulting in one of the first international volumes to highlight Portugal's diverse and complex migration flows. Transnationalism also takes centre stage in several contributions that survey various types of informal and formal networks in local communities and across national borders. Via American studies, anthropology, cultural studies, ethnology, history, social psychology and sociology, the authors come from an array of disciplines as dynamic as the continent about which they write. This title is available in the OAPEN Library - http://www.oapen.org.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt46mvd1">Identity Processes and Dynamics in Multi-Ethnic Europe</a><br>
  Author(s) Westin Charles<br>
  Abstract: This volume is about inter-ethnic relations in Europe with special emphasis on identity dynamics and identity processes. Here the concept of inter-ethnic relations comprises a broad range of encounters, between people and groups of diverse origins, taking place in contemporary societies. Much of the literature emphasises the problematic dimensions of these relations, pertaining to various aspects of social exclusion – racism, discrimination, segregation, xenophobia, ethnocentrism, inequality and injustice. However, inter-ethnic relations should also be understood to encompass processes of social inclusion, referred to under various headings such as incorporation, insertion, acculturation, assimilation, integration and even absorption. In other words, inter-ethnic<br>

  Author(s) Bastos Susana<br>
  Abstract: The preference for an anthropological reflection upon identity processes as a means to overcome the micro-macro dichotomy that has hampered the development of the social sciences (Calhoun 1996) immediately faces a number of obstacles. A strategy of total subjective and relative social research, reduced to micro-dimensions (limited to the construction of the self and interaction), may impede an analysis of the relationships between socio-historical groups. Similarly, a strategy of conceptual and theoretical babelisation of the concept of identity (and its derivatives) may lead to the loss of its analytical function in understanding historical dynamics.<br>

  Abstract: Postmodern and post-colonial discourses have praised hybridity and ambivalence as enriching traces of identity-building in our age of multidirectional migrations as if only travelling between and across cultures through transnational dislocations could provide the experience of developing diasporic, hyphenated or deterritorialised identities. But some authors are beginning to challenge what may be too narrow a perspective of the social conditions from which such identities can spring. The Portuguese sociologist Santos recently highlighted the fact that since its inception Portuguese colonialism has always been an experience of ambivalence and hybridity in the relationship it promoted between the coloniser and the colonised.<br>

  Abstract: Hall (2000) presents two ways of thinking about cultural identity. The first position defines cultural identity in terms of one shared culture among people with a common history and ancestry where cultural identities reflect the mutual historical experiences and shared cultural codes which provide us, as ‘one people’, with stable, unchanging and continuous frames of reference and meaning, beneath the shifting divisions of the present. The second position, although related to the first, recognises that as well as the many points of similarity there are also critical points of significant difference which constitute what we really are, or rather, what<br>

  Abstract: Emigration was an economic strategy for Cape Verdeans from as early as the eighteenth century. It has become an important element of Cape Verdean social identity or, as this identity also has been called, Cape Verdeanness. In a situation where there are more Cape Verdean emigrants and their descendants outside Cape Verde than living within the archipelago itself,¹ traditional theories of migration and/or national identity placing more importance on origin than on all other features in the process of identity construction seem misplaced.<br>

  Abstract: In two texts written 50 years apart, Erikson (1972: 274) and Bauman (2003) both attribute the relatively recent preoccupation with identity processes to the great economic and social transformations which destroyed community life, made subjects and families culturally vulnerable and created mounting internal and international migratory fluxes which temporarily increased tolerance to uncertainties (Appadurai 1998). Erikson developed his cluster of identity concepts within a relatively closed community, based on intergenerational recognition, and characterised by an antagonistic exteriority that conveniently sanctioned its relative closure. On the other hand, Bauman (2003: 16) theorises on community fixation, in line with Fromm (1941), less<br>

  Abstract: No tradition, intellectual or otherwise, can exist or stay alive without demarcating its own identity from something that is seen as representing its negative counterpart, its ‘other’; and as a result, this ‘other’ necessarily accompanies any tradition, as the shadowy background or dark canvas which allows it to draw the contours of its own identity in the first place. The presence of this shadow can therefore never be forgotten; but in order to fulfill its role as a negative background, neither can it be brought into the full daylight of memory and recollection.

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Abstract: After decades of critical skepticism, studies of both sentimentalism and childhood are becoming thriving areas of scholarly inquiry and analysis. In Hildegard Hoeller’s recent assessment, the study of sentiment is “cooking on all burners,” having overcome a century of marginality in the American literary canon to become a nimbly theorized, richly interdisciplinary body of work.¹ Her review of new scholarship finds sentimentality finally treated “as a central concept in American culture, the very vehicle through which Americans imagined themselves and defined their

  Book Title: Southern Masculinity-Perspectives on Manhood in the South since Reconstruction<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): Friend Craig Thompson<br>
  Abstract: The follow-up to the critically acclaimed collection Southern Manhood: Perspectives on Masculinity in the Old South (Georgia, 2004), Southern Masculinity explores the contours of southern male identity from Reconstruction to the present. Twelve case studies document the changing definitions of southern masculine identity as understood in conjunction with identities based on race, gender, age, sexuality, and geography. After the Civil War, southern men crafted notions of manhood in opposition to northern ideals of masculinity and as counterpoint to southern womanhood. At the same time, manliness in the South--as understood by individuals and within communities--retained and transformed antebellum conceptions of honor and mastery. This collection examines masculinity with respect to Reconstruction, the New South, racism, southern womanhood, the Sunbelt, gay rights, and the rise of the Christian Right. Familiar figures such as Arthur Ashe are investigated from fresh angles, while other essays plumb new areas such as the womanless wedding and Cherokee masculinity.<br>

  Abstract: The line between the idea of cultural region, generally delineated according to human criteria, and ecological region and bioregion, defined by natural factors, would seem to be fairly sharp and clear. Sometimes, though, that line becomes blurred in ways that force closer examination of these spatial concepts and the ways that they relate to each other. For example, northern New England can be seen as a distinct literary subregion distinguished by the differences that writers more or less self-consciously draw between dominant tropes of New England regional identity as a whole and the ways of life that they feel characterize<br>

  Abstract: The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,<br>

  Book Title: Seasons of Misery-Catastrophe and Colonial Settlement in Early America<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): DONEGAN KATHLEEN<br>
  Abstract: The stories we tell of American beginnings typically emphasize colonial triumph in the face of adversity. But the early years of English settlement in America were characterized by catastrophe: starvation, disease, extreme violence, ruinous ignorance, and serial abandonment.
      Seasons of Miseryoffers a provocative reexamination of the British colonies' chaotic and profoundly unstable early days, placing crisis-both experiential and existential-at the center of the story. At the outposts of a fledgling empire and disconnected from the social order of their home society, English settlers were both physically and psychologically estranged from their European identities. They could not control, or often even survive, the world they had intended to possess. According to Kathleen Donegan, it was in this cauldron of uncertainty that colonial identity was formed. Studying the English settlements at Roanoke, Jamestown, Plymouth, and Barbados, Donegan argues that catastrophe marked the threshold between an old European identity and a new colonial identity, a state of instability in which only fragments of Englishness could survive amid the upheavals of the New World. This constant state of crisis also produced the first distinctively colonial literature as settlers attempted to process events that they could neither fully absorb nor understand. Bringing a critical eye to settlers' first-person accounts, Donegan applies a unique combination of narrative history and literary analysis to trace how settlers used a language of catastrophe to describe unprecedented circumstances, witness unrecognizable selves, and report unaccountable events.Seasons of Miseryaddresses both the stories that colonists told about themselves and the stories that we have constructed in hindsight about them. In doing so, it offers a new account of the meaning of settlement history and the creation of colonial identity.<br>

  Book Title: Marrow of Human Experience, The-Essays on Folklore by William A. Wilson<br>

  Abstract: As a body, Wilson's essays develop related topics and connected themes. This collection organizes them in three coherent parts. The first examines the importance of folklore-what it is and its value in various contexts. Part two, drawing especially on the experience of Finland, considers the role of folklore in national identity, including both how it helps define and sustain identity and the less savory ways it may be used for the sake of nationalistic ideology. Part three, based in large part on Wilson's extensive work in Mormon folklore, which is the most important in that area since that of Austin and Alta Fife, looks at religious cultural expressions and outsider perceptions of them and, again, at how identity is shaped, by religious belief, experience, and participation; by the stories about them; and by the many other expressive parts of life encountered daily in a culture.<br>

As with his other studies, however, he is careful to ground issues of identity in the distinctive historical and cultural experience of specific groups and recognize that differences often emerge.<br>

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

  Author(s) De Souza Pascale<br>
  Abstract: The general lack of scholarly interest in the contribution of island cultures to postcolonial debate, as underlined by the Caribbean/South Pacific scholar Elizabeth Deloughrey (2001a: 22), takes on specific dimensions within Francophone postcolonial studies. While Caribbean authors have elicited much interest, literature from the Mascarenes and the South Pacific remains to a large extent excluded both from Francophone research conducted in Europe or North America and from Anglophone postcolonial discussions of regional identity. Comparative readings have the potential, however, to reveal rifts and commonalities.<br>

  Author(s) Forsdick Charles<br>
  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Author(s) Woodhull Winifred<br>
  Abstract: Insofar as film scholarship followed literary studies, in the 1980s and 1990s, in taking up Benedict Anderson’s work on the construction of national identity through imagined communities, much attention has been devoted to looking at French films that participate in that process by construing colonized peoples as primitive and frequently feminized ‘Others’, in opposition to whom the French define themselves as rational, enlightened and civilized. Like the films themselves, the analyses vary in the degree to which they see colonizer/colonized relations in terms of stark binaries or in terms of ambiguous hybrid identities on both sides. Yet whatever the emphasis,<br>

  Abstract: After the Shoah politics and political solidarity take on a different quality. The attribution of an identity and the affirmation of that identity have to be viewed as importantly different. It is no longer possible to define Jewish identity simply in terms of the object of persecution and oppression.¹ Such descriptions deny the possibility of that conception of identity that Jews would attribute to themselves. The politics of identity has to take the divide between attribution and affirmation as central to any understanding and evaluation of claims concerning identity.

  Abstract: Monuments to the Irish Famine can be found in communities across three continents; while the majority remain relatively unseen, unknown affairs, a small proportion has attained widespread recognition and attention. These memorials are the products of sustained, well-funded, and organized commemorative efforts, usually supported by an infrastructure of official and/or national bodies, and present an embodiment of Famine memory explicitly intended for wider viewership. As a consequence, many bear the scars of protracted civic negotiation and politicized appropriation, of artistic vision and compromise, and of struggles between competing versions of Irish history and identity. They are, in every sense, ‘monumental’<br>

  Abstract: France provides a particularly complex and fascinating object of analysis for any investigation into the impact of war on modern and contemporary cultural production and cultural history, having been at war for almost fifty years of the twentieth century. This impact is characterised by radically different experiences and memories of the two world wars, and further complicated by enduring legacies of those wars, and of subsequent, brutal colonial wars. An understanding of the impact that the experiences of these different types of war have made on French cultural, social and political identity is essential for the broader analysis of developments<br>

What is it about the branches of neurons that makes individuals think the way they do? Literary realism has similar limits.

  Book Title: Japanese Philosophy-A Sourcebook<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Maraldo John C.<br>
  Abstract: With
      Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebook,readers of English can now access in a single volume the richness and diversity of Japanese philosophy as it has developed throughout history. Leading scholars in the field have translated selections from the writings of more than a hundred philosophical thinkers from all eras and schools of thought, many of them available in English for the first time.TheSourcebookeditors have set out to represent the entire Japanese philosophical tradition-not only the broad spectrum of academic philosophy dating from the introduction of Western philosophy in the latter part of the nineteenth century, but also the philosophical ideas of major Japanese traditions of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shinto. The philosophical significance of each tradition is laid out in an extensive overview, and each selection is accompanied by a brief biographical sketch of its author and helpful information on placing the work in its proper context. The bulk of the supporting material, which comprises nearly a quarter of the volume, is given to original interpretive essays on topics not explicitly covered in other chapters: cultural identity, samurai thought, women philosophers, aesthetics, bioethics.An introductory chapter provides a historical overview of Japanese philosophy and a discussion of the Japanese debate over defining the idea of philosophy, both of which help explain the rationale behind the design of the Sourcebook. An exhaustive glossary of technical terminology, a chronology of authors, and a thematic index are appended. Specialists will find information related to original sources and sinographs for Japanese names and terms in a comprehensive bibliography and general index.Handsomely presented and clearly organized for ease of use,Japanese Philosophy: A Sourcebookwill be a cornerstone in Japanese studies for decades to come. It will be an essential reference for anyone interested in traditional or contemporary Japanese culture and the way it has shaped and been shaped by its great thinkers over the centuries.24 illus.<br>

  Abstract: Ever since Socrates accepted the Delphic oracle’s challenge to “know thyself,” the issue of personal identity has been part of the western philosophical repertoire. That issue typically broke down into two fundamental questions. The first was one of individual identity: who am I? The second was one of universal identity: what characterizes our humanity? Only in recent history has the West added questions of cultural, linguistic, and ethnic identity: for example, what does it mean to be French Canadian? Three circumstances have supported this rather new enterprise. The first is the rise of the social sciences, especially cultural anthropology, sociology,<br>

Moments before, a gray haired stranger had ambled in through the temple gate, settled on a ledge, and casually narrated the founding legend of this village temple: a legend that featured Chandaphui’s mother, my grandmother Ba. This soft-spoken man had most likely not imagined that he would be addressing Ba’s descendents to explode over eighty years of silence and unsettle our conceptions of ancestral identity.<br>

  Book Title: Relative Histories-Mediating History in Asian American Family Memoirs<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Rocío G.<br>
  Abstract: Relative Histories focuses on the Asian American memoir that specifically recounts the story of at least three generations of the same family. This form of auto/biography concentrates as much on other members of one’s family as on oneself, generally collapses the boundaries conventionally established between biography and autobiography, and in many cases—as Rocío G. Davis proposes for the auto/biographies of ethnic writers—crosses the frontier into history, promoting collective memory. Davis centers on how Asian American family memoirs expand the limits and function of life writing by reclaiming history and promoting community cohesion. She argues that identity is shaped by not only the stories we have been told, but also the stories we tell, making these narratives important examples of the ways we remember our family’s past and tell our community’s story. In the context of auto/biographical writing or filmmaking that explores specific ethnic experiences of diaspora, assimilation, and integration, this work considers two important aspects: These texts re-imagine the past by creating a work that exists both in history and as a historical document, making the creative process a form of re-enactment of the past itself. Each chapter centers on a thematic concern germane to the Asian American experience: the narrative of twentieth-century Asian wars and revolutions, which has become the subtext of a significant number of Asian American family memoirs (Pang-Mei Natasha Chang’s Bound Feet and Western Dress, May-lee and Winberg Chai’s The Girl from Purple Mountain, K. Connie Kang’s Home Was The Land of Morning Calm, Doung Van Mai Elliott’s The Sacred Willow); family experiences of travel and displacement within Asia in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, which unveil a history of multiple diasporas that are often elided after families immigrate to the United States (Helie Lee’s Still Life With Rice, Jael Silliman’s Jewish Portraits, Indian Frames, Mira Kamdar’s Motiba’s Tattoos); and the development of Chinatowns as family spaces (Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men, Lisa See’s On Gold Mountain, Bruce Edward Hall’s Tea that Burns). The final chapter analyzes the discursive possibilities of the filmed family memoir ("family portrait documentary"), examining Lise Yasui’s A Family Gathering, Ruth Ozeki Lounsbury’s Halving the Bones, and Ann Marie Fleming’s The Magical Life of Long Tack Sam. Davis concludes the work with a metaliterary engagement with the history of her own Asian diasporic family as she demonstrates the profound interconnection between forms of life writing.<br>

  Abstract: In his book,
                  Oneself as Another,Paul Ricoeur explains that identity is partly bound up in identification with significant others, which is the reason why, especially in autobiographies, writing the self implies writing the other. This idea resounds with one of the key insights in autobiography theory in the 1990s, namely that identity—for both men and women—is essentially relational, formed and defined in relation to others. As Laura Marcus points out, “Recounting one’s own life almost inevitably entails writing the life of an other or others; writing the life of another must surely entail the biographer’s identifications with<br>

  Abstract: This examination of the family narratives of Asian diasporic subjects gives us a sociohistorical portrait of an increasingly dynamic phenomenon. These stories explain particular histories by juxtaposing public events with private experiences, to reveal the ways families construct (or reconstruct) identity within the experience of diaspora. Giving a sense of cohesion and closure to the lives of grandparents and parents can establish a sense of authority and meaning to the writer’s own life story. Access to these stories also allows readers to understand the development of particular ethnic communities, as the narratives support the production of a history and culture<br>

The philosopher Martin Heidegger derives the notion of “world” from his study of Jakob von Uexküll’s biological research, which suggested that different sentient life forms have different experiences of their surroundings, and hence phenomenologically (that is, experientially) different worlds. A “world” in this sense is a zone of things that surround the sentient being, which have various kinds of significance for that being.<br>

  Book Title: Textual Intimacy-Autobiography and Religious Identities<br>
  Publisher: University of Virginia Press<br>
  Author(s): KORT WESLEY A.<br>
  Abstract: Given its affinity with questions of identity, autobiography offers a way into the interior space between author and reader, especially when writers define themselves in terms of religion. In his exploration of this "textual intimacy," Wesley Kort begins with a theorization of what it means to say who one is and how one's self-account as a religious person stands in relation to other forms of self-identification. He then provides a critical analysis of autobiographical texts by nine contemporary American writers-including Maya Angelou, Philip Roth, and Anne Lamott-who give religion a positive place in their accounts of who they are. Finally, in disclosing his own religious identity, Kort concludes with a meditation on several meanings of the word

  Abstract: Religious identity’s second facet is assumption as in consciously taking something on, like assuming the responsibilities of office upon being sworn in. Usually the second facet is a response to challenges that question or present alternatives to a religious identity that, heretofore, had simply been assumed. These challenges need not result in radical change, although, as we saw earlier in some of the self-accounts, they can. More often they produce a process of distancing, uncertainty, and reformulation.<br>

While the need or desire for acceptance or inclusion may seem to signal weakness or low self-confidence, I think of it as a sign of health and as part of daily life. Even more, however, it is part of religious belief and behavior.

  Abstract: This book engages questions of space and spatial imagination in Caribbean fiction. Through the lens of contemporary spatial theory, I offer a comparative and interdisciplinary view of Caribbean postcolonial discourse. This discourse, in its inherently spatial orientation, contributes to and even anticipates the growing interest in space and place as critical categories fundamental for our understanding of social and political identity. Many Caribbean writers emphasize not only the cultural and linguistic legacy of colonialism but also its impact on space and spatial hierarchy. This question of spatial hierarchy has an even broader relevance: How are ordinary people, whom the Marxist<br>

  3  “No Admittance”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrm9c">Locating the Destitute</a><br>
  Abstract: The approach to identity as an outcome of spatial practice constitutes one of the most important aspects of V. S. Naipaul’s semi-autobiographical novel
                  A House for Mr. Biswas(1961). This novel is a prime example of the correlation between spatial theory and Caribbean postcolonial discourse and draws into sharper focus a number of questions that I have been raising. The novel consists of a central triad—space, self, and writing—that, in its triple orientation, allows me to examine the material significance of the house, its impact on identity, and its symbolic relevance in the protagonist’s quest for autonomy and<br>

  4  Squatters in the Cathedral of the Written Word: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wrm9c">Locating the Destitute</a><br>
  Abstract: Patrick Chamoiseau’s
                  Texaco(1992) chronicles the squatter community of Texaco, a slum located at the edge of Martinique’s capital, Fort-de-France. As an underprivileged and illegitimate space, the slum reflects and shapes the lives of its inhabitants. The abandoned lot of the Texaco petroleum company is gradually settled by former slaves who, fleeing the plantation, arrive in the city in search of employment. The squatters’ occupation of the abandoned site signals the spontaneous cultural potential of “an open community grounded not on identity but on strategic alliance” (Lincoln, 3), while also reflecting, in spatial terms, the historical deprivation of the Martinican<br>

One need only note how impossible it would be for someone who participated in the war to tell stories about it the way people used to tell stories about their adventures.”¹ (2) The war is “as totally divorced from experience as is the functioning of a machine from the movement of the body, which only begins to resemble it in pathological<br>

  Abstract: Unlike the many Francophone African autobiographers who practiced autobiography at a relatively early age, Amadou Hampâté Bâ came to first-person narrative at the last stage of his career as a writer. Bâ was well known as a “traditionalist” for his endeavor to preserve African culture and traditions through his writings. He published many folktales and essays about identity in the African context, defining himself as a “man of culture.”

  Abstract: Patrick Chamoiseau was born in Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, in 1953. He studied law both in his country of birth and in France, and he served as a probation officer in Fort-de-France before working as a librarian with young prisoners in France. Chamoiseau collaborated with his fellow countryman Raphaël Confiant and Jean Bernabé on the literary manifesto

  Abstract: The followers of Pythagoras introduced us to a sacramental dimension of the ancient concept of the symbol. The secretive tradition that grew up around the Presocratic philosopher’s legend employed his “symbols,” the short epigrammatic sayings attributed to him, as tokens of true identity and as a kind of catechism in a ritualized ascent to knowledge. They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

  Book Title: Available Light-Anthropological Reflections on Philosophical Topics<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geertz Clifford<br>
  Abstract: Geertz, who once considered a career in philosophy, begins by explaining how he got swept into the revolutionary movement of symbolic anthropology. At that point, his work began to encompass not only the ethnography of groups in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but also the study of how meaning is made in all cultures--or, to use his phrase, to explore the "frames of meaning" in which people everywhere live out their lives. His philosophical orientation helped him to establish the role of anthropology within broader intellectual circles and led him to address the work of such leading thinkers as Charles Taylor, Thomas Kuhn, William James, and Jerome Bruner. In this volume, Geertz comments on their work as he explores questions in political philosophy, psychology, and religion that have intrigued him throughout his career but that now hold particular relevance in light of postmodernist thinking and multiculturalism.

  Chapter Five  The Odd Triangle: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: From Augustine to our own era, introspection is inextricable from “self-consciousness,” which in turn is integral to and, in some sense, coincident with various understandings of selfhood. Simply, self-consciousness is enacted through self-reflexivity, and in this process of self-awareness, identity emerges. But the word “reflexivity” has a more circumscribed history. Reflexivity appears as a paradigm of understanding the self during the early modern period, coincident with the preoccupation with optics and the birth of a new physics of light. “Reflexivity” was first applied to cognitive introspection, in referring to “thought as bending back upon itself,” in the 1640s, when theologians,<br>

  Chapter Six  Who Is the Subject? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7rrpr">Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher</a><br>
  Abstract: Freud’s thinking about the ego combines several formulations, which begin with early modernist principles. In some sense, he draws an alliance with Descartes’s meditation, “I am a thinking thing,” as the “true” center of his identity. Indeed, the modernist endeavor to define personal identity begins by recognizing that the self cannot be derived, but instead, the Cartesian
                  cogitans—the end point of the skeptic’s query—serves as the starting point of self-consciousness.¹ Accordingly, to the extent that “identity” has a definition in the Freudian universe, it must be that which can be identified; that is, the conscious ego examines and<br>

  Book Title: Performing Africa-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EBRON PAULLA A.<br>
  Abstract: Africa often enters the global imagination through news accounts of ethnic war, famine, and despotic political regimes. Those interested in countering such dystopic images--be they cultural nationalists in the African diaspora or connoisseurs of "global culture"--often found their representations of an emancipatory Africa on an enthusiasm for West African popular culture and performance arts. Based on extensive field research in The Gambia and focusing on the figure of the jali, Performing Africa interrogates these representations together with their cultural and political implications. It explores how Africa is produced, circulated, and consumed through performance and how encounters through performance create the place of Africa in the world. Innovative and discerning, Performing Africa is a provocative contribution to debates over cultural nationalism and the construction of identity and history in Africa and elsewhere.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s6ph">Performing Africa</a><br>
  Abstract: History projects attempt to make a past that answers the challenge of nation-building and political identity. Yet the elements required to generate a sense of national identity and political culture are not clear. The chapters in this part discuss the negotiation of Gambian political culture in the postcolonial era up to the early 1990s, before the shift in political leadership in 1994. I examine the divergent political and cultural projects of those who imagine themselves as its makers: professional historians, government bureaucrats, national elites, and jali.

  Author(s): SEYHAN AZADE<br>
  Abstract: Some of the most innovative writers of contemporary literature are writing in diaspora in their second or third language. Here Azade Seyhan describes the domain of transnational poetics they inhabit. She begins by examining the works of selected bilingual and bicultural writers of the United States (including Oscar Hijuelos, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Eva Hoffman) and Germany (Libuse Moníková, Rafik Schami, and E. S. Özdamar, among others), developing a new framework for understanding the relationship between displacement, memory, and language. Considering themes of loss, witness, translation, identity, and exclusion, Seyhan interprets diasporic literatures as condensed archives of cultural and linguistic memory that give integrity and coherence to pasts ruptured by migration.<br>

At this historical juncture, over six million foreigners, including Gastarbeiter (guest workers), refugees, asylum seekers, writers, artists, and professionals are permanently settled in Germany. In the embattled Europe of the post-cold-war era, Germany, with its economic power, political stability, generous welfare system, and what until recently were very flexible asylum laws, has become, perhaps quite unwittingly and unwillingly, the destination for a growing body of dis- placed peoples.

The symbolic registers of the nation usually increase proportionately to the length of time spent outside the nation, and the loyalties that bind the “imagined community” (Anderson) diverge into smaller communities bound by gender, class, caste, religion, home region, profession, language, and dialect.

  Abstract: Adam Seligman, one of our most important social thinkers, continues the incisive critique of modernity he began in his previously acclaimed
         The Idea of Civil SocietyandThe Problem of Trust.In this provocative new work of social philosophy, Seligman evaluates modernity's wager, namely, the gambit to liberate the modern individual from external social and religious norms by supplanting them with the rational self as its own moral authority. Yet far from ensuring the freedom of the individual, Seligman argues, "the fundamentalist doctrine of enlightened reason has called into being its own nemesis" in the forms of ethnic, racial, and identity politics. Seligman counters that the modern human must recover a notion of authority that is essentially transcendent, but which extends tolerance to those of other--or no--faiths.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter ended with the problem of recognition, which lies at the core of the “politics of identity.” With authority internalized as individual right, mutual recognition becomes an elusive goal as, in de Tocqueville’s words, “each man is narrowly shut in himself and from that basis makes the pretense to judge the world.”¹ With recognition lost, the self comes increasingly to rest solely on the calculus and negotiation of power. Wills are, to return to the nomenclature of our opening chapter, coerced from without, rather than subjugated from within. The result is a situation fraught with paradox: the very<br>

  Abstract: Some of the more interesting things that Christianity has to say about territorial boundaries come by way of its views on the nation, national identity and loyalty, and nationalism. Historically, of course, Christianity—or, rather, Christians—have said different and sometimes quite contradictory things on these topics. Some have considered each nation to be specially ordained by the eternal God, while others have stressed the mutable historicality of national compositions and boundaries.¹ Some have virtually equated loyalty to the nation with loyalty to God, while others have regarded it as inimical to pacific, universalist Christian faith.

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

  Abstract: IN PLACING so high an estimate in chapter 2 on autobiography as an indispensable, authoritative source of biographical insight, I may have seemed to subscribe to one of the sustaining myths of autobiography, belief in the possibility of self-determination. What—or how much—does an autobiographer really mean when he or she speaks of writing a life? The drive in writing lives toward an identity between story and the personal history that is its subject—“this is no book, / Who touches this touches a man”—is reflected in the ambiguous uses of the word

  CHAPTER 6  “Routes/Roots”: from:

                  The Practice of Everyday Life. It involves maps and mapping, routes and routing, borders and bordercrossings. As a form of relational spatialization, however, it incorporates the opposing dimensions of the homonym routes/roots. Traveling is a concept that depends upon the notion of stasis to be comprehensible. Routes are pathways between here and there, two points of rootedness.

Similarly, Cook shows that love poetry proceeds out of a profound failure of language resulting from the opacity of discourse, its lack of neutrality, or the fugitive transparency of reference. Writing Lovers also explores race, ethnicity, age, and sexual identity within the context of the passionate excesses of amatory discourse.<br>

The concept of oceanity refers at once to the direction and to the outcome of the symbolic appropriation of the Australian continent; in this sense, oceanity constitutes a reference point diametrically opposed to the European pole, since it is constructed at the latter’s expense. The concept ends up embracing all the attempts to create an authentic national identity, sometimes known as

While the dynamics of abstraction and experience will continue to guide the investigation, the turn from paradigm to person will bring to light distinctive features of the works of Pound and Eliot. The present chapter, devoted to Ezra Pound, begins with the poet’s tendency to think in terms of certain oppositions—form/flux, abstraction/experience, identity/difference, unity/multiplicity—and then to find constructs that hold together the antithetical terms. This attempt to integrate form and flux is typical of Pound’s approach<br>

The dominant patterns of understanding required what was potential to be made actual by a process of transformation that narrowed the distance of relationship until it closed. Closure came through affective bonding in which love, conflict, and hatred could combine.

In Hardy and Conrad, “become who you are” is a calamitous and unwanted pronouncement. What these protagonists want is immaculate self-fulfillment, achieved in the idiom of their culture’s prescriptions. Tess would be pure, Jude would be learned, Jim would be a hero, Nostromo would be admired. They are unfree exactly in the measure that their incarnate propensities—the fears and desires that they carry into every activity—are anathema to the models of behavior and achievement they propose for themselves:<br>

Lawrence seeks to center identity on flame-life (he even sees the surrounding world of matter, the sun and the moon, as derived from flame-life),¹ and the goal of the Lawrentian protagonist is as simple as it is elusive: to achieve the mobile flame-life of pure being.

  Abstract: Born into a church, family, and country that devour their own progeny, Joyce spent the first twenty years of his life doing something that others in less inimical circumstances do with less urgency and self-consciousness. He spent those years finding and then defending his identity from his culture’s claims upon it.¹ His culture conspired to make him other, to coerce him into signing its testimonials. He was to be the child of the Catholic Church, the son of an Irish gentleman, the citizen of a ghostly Gaelic community. Each of these identities reinforced the others, and together they proposed for<br>

  Book Title: Subaltern Appeal to Experience-Self-Identity, Late Modernity, and the Politics of Immediacy<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ireland Craig<br>
  Abstract: Combining historical findings with discourse analyses and diagnostic readings of recent subaltern and aesthetic inquiry, Ireland reveals that the term experience has been incorrectly understood. Since the 1970s, persistent appeals to experience in identity politics and cultural inquiry testify not only to the influence of a particular modern concept but, more importantly, to the historical status of modern self-identity.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: Over the last few decades, the term “experience” has persistently preoccupied certain strands in cultural, subaltern, and aesthetic inquiry concerned with issues of agency, identity formation or counterhegemonic resistance. This preoccupation with experience has also sparked a series of skirmishes since the 1970s between those who debunk experience as the stuff of an antiquated philosophy of consciousness and those who, on the contrary, seek its rehabilitation by resurrecting Dilthey or Dewey. Heated and protracted exchanges on experience take place to this day in such journals as the

  1  The Appeal of Immediate Experience from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zxm6">Subaltern Appeal to Experience</a><br>
  Abstract: The concept of experience has elicited the interest of various academic disciplines for at least the last two centuries. But only the last three decades can rightly be called, to borrow Michael Rutschky’s expression, decades of
                  Erfahrungshunger.¹ Unlike in earlier decades, where it had remained largely within the confines of academia, by the 1970s the concept of experience had frequently become the stuff of programmatic manifestos, and it was enlisted as the ground from which it was (and still is) believed could be erected microstrategies of resistance, subaltern counterhistories, and a politics of identity. Experience spilled over into the streets,<br>

  Abstract: Writing, the exigency of writing: no longer the writing that has always ... been in the service of the speech or thought that is called idealist (that is to say, moralizing), but rather the writing that through its own slowly liberated force (the aleatory force of absence) seems to devote itself solely to itself as something that remains without identity, and little by little brings forth possibilities that are entirely other: an anonymous, distracted, deferred, and dispersed way of being in relation, by which everything is brought<br>

  Abstract: Perhaps the time will never arrive when our common manner of speaking reflects a disavowal of the voice as the repository of being. And perhaps this refusal signifies, above all else, the unyielding reign of ontology. However, there are reasons to believe this regime is being challenged by discourses that desimplify traditional exigencies and propel thought in the direction of the unthinkable - that disturbing situation in which, or because of which, identity can no longer approach within the confines of a beyond accessible through language. While I cannot cling to any hard and fast conclusions here, it is nonetheless<br>

  Abstract: In Alistair MacLeod’s “The Closing Down of Summer,” Gaelic-speaking Cape Breton miners carry sprigs of spruce from Cape Breton with them “to Africa as mementos or talismans or symbols of identity.” “Much,” argues the narrator, “as our Highland ancestors, for centuries, fashioned crude badges of heather or whortleberries to accompany them on the battlefields of the world.

  Author(s) CARIOU WARREN<br>
  Abstract: Métis stories are something like the Rigoureau, the shape-changing wolf-man character which often appears in those stories. The Rigoureau is an amalgam of European werewolf legendry and Oji-Cree shape-changer narratives, and perhaps because of this it is a creature of liminality, a dangerous passe-partout, a trickster, a traitor, a folk hero, an outsider. In other words, it is the perfect metaphor for the slipperiness of Métis identity itself. I grew up hearing Rigoureau stories, and I was even told once that my Uncle Vic

  Book Title: A Portrait of the Artist as Australian-L’Oeuvre bizarre de Barry Humphries<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): ST PIERRE PAUL MATTHEW<br>
  Abstract: A Portrait of the Artist as Australian offers the first critical assessment of Barry Humphries' entire career - as a daring postmodern deconstructionist on stage, film, and television, with sixty-seven stage shows, twenty-four film and thirty-four video appearances, thirty-four television series and seventy-one television appearances, and seventy-two audio recordings, but especially what he calls his "second career" as author of twenty-nine books. With an oeuvre that includes novels, biographies, autobiographies, editions, compilations, comic books, poetry, dramatic monologues, sketches, film scripts, and several unclassified works, Humphries is a literary and dramatic artist of considerable significance. Arguing that Humphries is one of Australia's greatest writers, Paul Matthew St Pierre reveals a multi-faceted artist whose success is rooted in music halls, Dadaism, and his identity as an Australian.<br>

  Abstract: “Re-vision,” says Adrienne Rich in a 1971 essay,¹ has revolutionary potential. Re-vision can be revolutionary when understood as “the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction … an act of survival.” Enriching the term even more, Rich calls it a “drive to self-knowledge … more than a search for identity … part of our refusal of the self-destructiveness of male-dominated society … how we can begin to see and name – and therefore live – afresh” (“When We Dead Awaken: Writing as Re-Vision” 35).

  Abstract: Freeman’s (1978) and Suleiman’s (1991) reflections on identity and difference – on the perils that attend seeing “there” as (always already) an encroachment on “here,” and “them” as alien and a threat to the charmed circle of “us” – were written in the shadow of the Gulf War and the war in Bosnia, respectively. I read their apt metaphors as timely reminders: affirming (through the organic tropes) the human longing to belong, contesting any view of identity as homogeneous or bounded, and recognizing the shifting and variable nature of identifications.

He does not claim that his idea is wholly original, for he finds aspects of it in the thought of the nineteenth-century social reformer Robert Owen. Owen argued that the new capitalism had caused not simply the material impoverishment of the workers but also the disruption of the ethical culture to which they belonged and through which they defined their identity. He was among the first to recognize that economic institutions have an impact on people’s cultural self-understanding. He advocated — and actually established - an alternative organization of<br>

  Abstract: Aphorism, while constituting a literary genre
                  per se,can function concomitantly with a different genre — for example, the novel. Aphorisms deployed along with another genre serve both as a component of the overall text and as text in and of themselves. Given their differentiated identity, aphorisms display idiosyncratic powers of evocation peculiar to the genre. Because of its peculiar behaviour in relation to the narrated chain of events, aphorism often demands the reader’s focused attention. Once a reader becomes conscious of their rhetorical and semantic content, a novel’s aphorisms might do little more than support a traditional reading of the<br>

  Book Title: Diasporic Feminist Theology-Asia and Theopolitical Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Kang Namsoon<br>
  Abstract: How do we navigate the question of identity in the fluid and pluralist conditions of postmodern society? Even more, how do we articulate identity as a defining particularity in the disappearance of borders, boundaries, and spaces in an increasingly globalist world? What constitutes identity and the formation of narratives under such conditions? How do these issues affect not only discursive practices, but theological and ethical construction and practice? This volumes explores these issues in depth. Diasporic Feminist Theology attempts to construct feminist theology by adopting diaspora as a theopolitical and ethical metaphor. Namsoon Kang here revisits and reexamines today’s significant issues such as identity politics, dislocation, postmodernism, postcolonialism, neoempire, Asian values, and constructs diasporic, transethnic, and glocal feminist theological discourses that create spaces of transformation, reconciliation, hospitality, worldliness, solidarity, and border-traversing. This work draws on diverse sources from contemporary critical discourses of diaspora studies, cultural studies, ethnic studies, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and feminism and feminist theology from a transterritorial space. This book is a landmark work, providing a comprehensive discourse for feminist theology today.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9m0snb">Diasporic Feminist Theology</a><br>
  Abstract: The question of self-identity, Who am I?, is an enduring theme in human reality. When one connects this question of Who am I? to the question of Who are we?, one forms a politics of identity. The question as to how and where people as groups construct and express the identity that holds them together is more complex than it appears on the surface. Identity politics has made tremendous contributions for the marginalized groups: raising self-awareness and self-dignity; challenging through politicization the mainstream claim to hegemonic power; providing spaces to claim their voices and experiences as legitimate; and empowering both<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding two chapters, we examined the turn to eschatology in the writings of Metz and Schillebeeckx as they attempted to respond to the cultural pressures faced by the European church in the 1960s. Initially, their distinctly modern approaches to eschatology allowed both theologians to champion a practical eschatology that operated rather comfortably within the wider cultural context. As we observed, however, it was not long before both theologians grew increasingly sensitive to the subsequent overidentification of the hope of Christianity with the hope of modern culture. This sensitivity to the nonidentity of eschatological and societal hope only would<br>

But is their reality as institutional entities here and now ultimately secondary to their deeper reality as historically grounded systems or processes for handing on a specific doctrinal and liturgical tradition from one generation to the next over hundreds or even thousands of years? In other words, is the Church primarily an institutional entity with a relatively fixed identity as a result of its longstanding doctrinal and liturgical heritage, or is the Church primarily a process or system for handing on<br>

  Abstract: This paper explores the prospects of a proactive approach to historical thinking in relation to the paradox of human difference and interdependence in a global context. The dual premise of my analysis is the reality and permanence of cultural (including religious) diversity of human societies, on the one hand, and the imperatives of peaceful and cooperative co-existence in an increasingly globalized environment, on the other. Competing visions of history, I suggest, have always been integral to conceptions of self-identity and relationship to the “other,” in individual and communal interactions.

  Abstract: Hannah Arendt’s political writings are frequently analyzed through the lenses of her German-Jewish identity or her tutelage under
                  existenzphilosophers like Martin Heidegger or Karl Jaspers. This approach has been useful in understanding much of what Arendt was trying to offer in her writings, but it also restricts our understanding of Arendt in very significant ways. Too much focus on Arendt’s direct influences (teachers, identity, place in history) has created an environment where academic work on Arendt has tried to dig into every possible historical clue it can to “come to terms” with her thought, in the same way that<br>

From the late eighteenth century on, the engagement with the past, and particularly with ‘patriotic’ history (

Foucault spoke frequently of the connection between his intellectual work and his own experience and identity: “I have always held that my books are, in a sense, autobiographical fragments” (2001b: 1566–67).

  Book Title: The French Road Movie-Space, Mobility, Identity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Archer Neil<br>
  Abstract: The traditionally American genre of the road movie has been explored and reconfigured in the French context since the later 1960s. Comparative in its approach, this book studies the inter-relationship between American and French culture and cinemas, and in the process considers and challenges histories of the road movie. It combines film history with film theory methodologies, analysing transformations in social, political and film-industrial contexts alongside changing perspectives on the meaning and possibilities of film. At once chronological and thematic in structure,
      The French Road Movieprovides in each chapter a comprehensive introduction to key themes emerging from the genre in the French context - liberty, identity and citizenship, masculinity, femininity, border-crossing - followed by detailed, innovative and often revisionist readings of the chosen films. Through these readings the author justifies the place of the road genre within French cinema histories and reinvigorates this often neglected and misunderstood area of study.<br>

  Abstract: The aim of this book has been to historicize and understand French cinema’s exploration of the road movie. As I suggested in my introduction, this is not a straightforward task. As the road movie is dif-fi cult to identify in culturally specific terms, and is therefore always a genre in search of its identity, a French road movie is engaged in a constant negotiation of its own physical and conceptual boundaries. In fact, as I hope to have shown, analysing the ‘French road movie’ ultimately begs the question of its ‘French-ness’. If the road movie, to an extent, resists being<br>

Nations share that characteristic with other identities with which they coexist, for instance, gender, regional or transnational identities.¹ All these forms of social identity can be further understood, according to the classic definition of Henri Tajfel, ‘as that part of the individual’s self-concept which derives from his knowledge of his membership of a social group (or groups) together with the value and emotional significance attached to that membership’.²<br>

  Abstract: In the soapbox speeches of politicians, references to Europe have until recently functioned as an institutionalized appeal to overcome the nationstate. Intellectuals like the political scientist Jerzy Mackow have lent weight to this notion by calling for a ‘European idea’—which he aptly calls ‘Europeanism’—analogous to the development of nationalism during the nineteenth century. In order to build a common identity on the basis of history beyond ‘a bunch of national narratives and legends,’ he argues ‘the Europeans need to learn and understand European history.’¹ Even the past chairman of the Association of German Historians Johannes Fried warns that<br>

  Chapter 3  Writing National Histories in Europe: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qdff2">Conflicted Memories</a><br>
  Author(s) Berger Stefan<br>
  Abstract: The rise of national identity discourses in Europe accompanied the growing professionalization and institutionalization of history writing in the nineteenth century. Consequently national history writing became, for about one century between 1850 and 1950, the dominant form of history writing across Europe. Of course, national history had been written long before the nineteenth century. Thus we can trace histories of England, for example, to medieval times.¹ And of course, national history continued to be a popular genre after the 1950s, in big nation-states as much as in smaller and reemerging or nascent nation states.

One factor is the perception that Muslims are making politically exceptional, culturally unreasonable or theologically alien demands upon European states. Against that, I wish to say, that the claims Muslims are making, in fact, parallel comparable arguments about gender or ethnic equality. Seeing the issue in that context shows how European and contemporary is the logic of mainstream Muslim identity politics. Additionally I shall argue that multicultural politics must embrace what I call a moderate secularism, and resist a radical secularism.<br>

  Book Title: Constructing Feminine Poetics in the Works of a Late-20th-Century Catalan Woman Poet: Maria-Mercè Marçal-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Vicedo Noelia Díaz<br>
  Abstract: This study focuses upon the work of the Catalan woman poet Maria-Mercè Marçal. It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.<br>

  Abstract: Through a detailed analysis of Marçal’s poetic evolution in the previous chapter, I have examined the conceptual and iconic frameworks that allow the poet to reelaborate her experience around the concept of being, particularly of her
                  ser dona. As a result, the dynamic poetic space and form shapes this remaking, rewriting and rereading of the self. Furthermore, it highlights the system of structures (linguistic and semiotic) that merge in the process of poetically reinscribing female identity. In this third chapter, I consider how the literary space of poetry harnesses the possibility of becoming a subject, formed and conceptualized in alternative<br>

  Book Title: Soul-Black Power, Politics, and Pleasure<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Green Richard C.<br>
  Abstract: No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than "Soul". Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.<br>

  Abstract: It has been more than a generation since Fannie Lou Hamer’s eloquent and moving plea for freedom and civil rights before the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. More than thirty years have elapsed since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led thousands of nonviolent protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to confront the racist phalanx of state police troopers defending segregation. The politics of resistance at that turbulent moment in our history gave new meaning to our sense of identity.

  Book Title: The Lebanese Diaspora-The Arab Immigrant Experience in Montreal, New York, and Paris<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Abdelhady Dalia<br>
  Abstract: The Lebanese are the largest group of Middle Eastern immigrants in the United States, and Lebanese immigrants are also prominent across Europe and the Americas. Based on over eighty interviews with first-generation Lebanese immigrants in the global cities of New York, Montreal and Paris, this book shows that the Lebanese diaspora - like all diasporas - constructs global relations connecting and transforming their new societies, previous homeland and world-wide communities. Taking Lebanese immigrants' forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.The Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.<br>

  Abstract: Like many of my respondents, I learned the meaning of being Arab in the United States. Growing up in Egypt, I studied Arab nationalism and the construction of a pan-ethnic Arab identity that was based on shared historical struggles and political interests. Aside from official narratives of coherent Arab ethnicity told in our history books, the decades of the 1970s and 1980s were fraught with fragmentation and conflict among Arab nations, and most people around me did not see themselves as Arabs.¹ Arriving in the United States, however, I sought out other Arabs, as this seemed a logical approach to<br>

  Abstract: In the various branches of the natural, mathematical, and human sciences, “identity” has a range of uses related to the property of sameness or consistency of an element regardless of the influence of other variables. “Personal identity,” the subset most relevant to studies children’s literature, is defined in the
                  Oxford English Dictionary(OED) as “the sameness of a person or thing all times and in all circumstances; the condition or fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else.” This definition has a rigidity that most contemporary scholars of children’s literature will find objectionable.

  Author(s) Mallan Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The word “queer” is a slippery one; its etymology is uncertain, and academic and popular usage attributes conflicting meanings to the word. By the mid-nineteenth century, “queer” was used as a pejorative term for a (male) homosexual. This negative connotation continues when it becomes a term for homophobic abuse. In recent years, “queer” has taken on additional uses: as an all-encompassing term for culturally marginalized sexualities—gay, lesbian, bi, trans, and intersex (GLBTI)—and as a theoretical strategy for deconstructing the binary oppositions that govern identity formation. Tracing its history, the

  Abstract: As long as we have a notion of a self-identity, most people have a moment in their life when they have been forced to recognise, as a result of events, that ‘I am not the same as I was, as I used to be’ (Strauss, 1959, p 95). This is the basic definition of the sociological concept of ‘turning points’ provided by Anselm Strauss in his 1959 book,

The project explores how such critics approach their vocation as critics in the light of their identity as members of the Latino/a experience and reality.

  Author(s) Segovia Fernando F.<br>
  Abstract: This project on the identity and role of the Latino/a biblical critic constitutes an exercise in racial-ethnic criticism in general and minority biblical criticism in particular. To express it otherwise: just as minority biblical criticism represents a variation of racial-ethnic criticism, so does an analysis of the critical task as envisioned by minority critics represent a variation of minority biblical criticism. To explain what this variation signifies and entails, it is imperative to conceptualize and formulate its placement within both critical frameworks. Toward this end, I draw on previous reflections, offered as part of a study of the poetics of<br>

  Author(s) Avalos Hector<br>
  Abstract: I am not a Latino biblical scholar. I am a biblical scholar who happens to be Latino. I make this distinction for a number of subtle but significant reasons. While my upbringing as a Mexican American Pentecostal Protestant rendered me intimately acquainted with the Bible, my secularist stance has an even larger influence on the topics and approaches I use in biblical scholarship. In fact, I would say that my experience with a chronic illness (Wegener’s Granulomatosis) explains more of my publications as a biblical scholar than my Latino identity (Avalos 1995, 1999, 2007).<br>

  Author(s) Botta Alejandro F.<br>
  Abstract: In this essay I am attempting a self-definition, which has proven to be a much more difficult task than I ever expected. Perhaps it is because my reluctant metamorphosis to USian¹ Latino is still unfinished, or perhaps because every attempt at self-definition is an attempt to capture just a moment of our continuous identity flow. As Fernando Segovia has stated, “The concept of Latin(o/a)ness … is neither self-evident nor determinate—self-contained and unchanging; readily accessible to and intelligible by all; bearing the same force throughout, regardless of historical situation or social-cultural formation. It is rather a construct” (2009, 199). Segovia<br>

  Abstract: Latino/a biblical criticism has from the beginning raised the question of critical task: the identity and role of the critic. This problematic it has pursued in recurrent fashion through the years, with greater intensity in recent times. Such focalization may be viewed as the result of various intersecting factors, social as well as cultural: the striking rise in population numbers within the country; the widening presence of points of origin from Latin America and the Caribbean; and the growing sophistication in matters of method and theory within the field of studies. With exploding demographics, multiplying backgrounds, and expanding discourses, the<br>

  Abstract: This collection of essays on the question of what makes Latino/a biblical interpretation “Latino/a” raises a central and intriguing issue for critics and readers alike: Is identity a matter of being and/or practice? Is the “Latino/a-ness” of an interpretation defined by the personal identity (howsoever defined) of the interpreter? Or is it a matter of how Latino/a biblical interpretation is practiced—that is, are there certain principles, sources, methods (reading strategies), or aims that make some biblical interpretations Latino/a and others not? In this concluding reflection it is not my intention to define Latino/a biblical interpretation in a rigid way,<br>

  Abstract: Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a). By virtue of its very title, Ventura Pons’s nineteenth feature film,
                  Barcelona (Un mapa)(2007), would therefore seem to be an ideal object for analysis from this kind of perspective. Indeed, the film’s title appears to point to the centrality<br>

The chapter will centre on Barcelona itself as a concrete locus of identity negotiation, and on the body as the specific site of that negotiation, through its presence in carnivalesque performance or by its absence, fragmentation or imprint. The body, in particular the puppet body, thus serves as a metaphor for discussing how the accultured<br>

Centred around an interracial family unit, the film explores the effects of (neo-) colonialism on concepts of race, cultural memory and identity politics, proposing contemporary Africa as a borderland in which hybridity flourishes. By foregrounding the experiences of mixed-race women and their families, and examining personal and cultural histories and identities, the film<br>

In this chapter, I propose to examine the ideology and strategy of two contrasting anti-racist groups – SOS Racisme (SOS) and the Mouvement des Indigènes de la République (MIR) – in relation to the political climate of 2005–9, a timeframe which encompasses several key events that brought to the surface issues<br>

In part, this is due to the tendency of Caribbean scholars to conceive of educational institutions primarily as instruments of the state to propagate and reinforce the hegemony exerted by domestic and foreign elites over political and economic institutions (Carnoy and Samoff, 1989; Henry and Stone, 1983; Miller, 1989).¹ Curriculum content, student assessment and placement,<br>

Postmodernism, too, has had a significant impact with its critique of the one-sided universalism typically associated with ‘the Enlightenment,’ as<br>

  Abstract: This essay is about the uneasy fit between confession and identity at two moments of heightened interest in securing a ‘true and perfect’ relation between the two: the trial of Henry Garnet, supposed confessor to the Gunpowder Plot conspirators in 1606, and the years just after the executions of the popish plot traitors in 1679. Both of the moments I shall discuss are a little after the most intense panic, when the broader consequences of crises began to manifest themselves.

  Abstract: In the absence of an institutional Catholic Church in England after the Reformation, lay piety loomed particularly large in the English recusant community’s efforts to sustain a sense of religious identity and culture. Though scholars of early modern Catholicism once disagreed about whether early modern Catholic culture was characterized by the survival of late medieval traditions or the influence of missionary priests, recent work on both English and Continental Catholicism has shown that it was in fact defined by complex interactions between the two, as the traditions of the past and the spiritual directives of the Counter-Reformation merged, clashed, and<br>

And what does the possibility of sudden death mean for our ability to understand the narrative of ourselves?For the first time, this collection brings together figures in contemporary philosophy and Kierkegaard studies to explore pressing questions like these in the philosophy of personal identity and moral psychology. These essays will both advance important ongoing discussions of selfhood and expand the light that, 200 years after his birth, Kierkegaard is still able to shed on contemporary problems.<br>

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) STOKES PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: Questions of self-constitution and personal identity have been amongst the most heavily contested topics in Anglophone philosophy over the last half-century. Yet the pedigree of this discussion goes back considerably further. Such questions are clearly at work as early as the second-century theologians Athenagoras and Irenaeus, who worried about how identity could be preserved in bodily resurrection,¹ and this eschatological dimension to the question was still very much alive in early modern discussions of mind and identity. Even Locke’s treatment of personal identity in his

  1  The Moments of a Life: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) SCHECHTMAN MARYA<br>
  Abstract: Over the past several decades narrative accounts of personal identity have become increasingly popular (see, e.g. Davenport 2012, MacIntyre 1984, Ricoeur 1992, Rudd 2012, Schechtman 1996, Taylor 1989). As the narrative approach has become more prominent it has, predictably, attracted its share of criticism, and there has been a fairly strong reaction against the idea that our lives can profitably be understood in narrative terms. The most common and forceful objection to this approach is often formulated as a kind of dilemma: either narrative theories really mean to claim that our lives are significantly like literary narratives or these views<br>

  2  Teleology, Narrative and Death from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) ALTSHULER ROMAN<br>
  Abstract: Consider the fission problem: a single human being, A, is divided into two such humans, B and C, through teleportation, divine intervention, or some other mythical power. Both B and C are psychologically continuous with A. As the established account of personal identity would have it, psychological continuity is sufficient for personal identity.¹ But if fission is conceptually possible, the psychological continuity view of personal identity faces a problem: since both B and C are psychologically continuous and thus identical with A, given the transitivity of identity it must follow that B and C are identical with each other. And<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) RUDD ANTHONY<br>
  Abstract: There has been a good deal of discussion in recent philosophy of narrative theories of personal identity and of ethics.¹ And there have been lively debates among Kierkegaard scholars about whether, and to what extent, Kierkegaard can be considered a narrative theorist, and the relevance of his thought to discussions of narrative in contemporary philosophy.² In some of these discussions, though, there has been a tendency to consider the notion of narrative apart from the broader philosophical context in which it was introduced by the chief founders of modern narrative theory – Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor and Paul Ricoeur.³ For them<br>

  4  Narrative Holism and the Moment from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) STOKES PATRICK<br>
  Abstract: Personal identity theory is a rather odd sort of hybrid: born of philosophy of mind and metaphysics, with some pneumatology and soteriology a bit further back in the family tree, and eccentric uncle philosophy of religion living in the shed out the back (where the others let him potter around doing his own thing, hoping he’ll eventually move out). When narrative theory married into this family, having been introduced in the 1980s via philosophy of history and through the dual tracks of MacIntyrean virtue ethics and Ricoeurian hermeneutics, it brought a much-needed infusion of ethics, value theory and philosophical psychology<br>

  5  Kierkegaard’s Erotic Reduction and the Problem of Founding the Self from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) STRAWSER MICHAEL<br>
  Abstract: The ‘signature narrative thesis’ serves particularly well in explaining how personal identity gets constituted through one’s reflective consciousness or understanding, although it leaves open the question of how reflective consciousness itself is constituted (cf. Davenport 2012: 2–3). Is the ‘self’ identical to the narrative form of a person’s understanding, or is there a deeper self than that which emerges on the reflective level? In contrast to this narrative view, according to recent scholarship the phenomenological tradition unanimously affirms that the core self is to be found in pre-reflective consciousness. Further, Kierkegaard has not only been suggested to be significant<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt16r0hb2">Narrative, Identity and the Kierkegaardian Self</a><br>
  Author(s) SIGRIST MICHAEL J.<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary discussions about narrativity and selfhood commonly make reference to Alastair MacIntyre’s
                  After Virtueand to the work of Charles Taylor from the seventies and eighties, especiallySources of the Self. Paul Ricoeur’s writings on the subject also figure prominently, and more recently, Marya Schechtman’sThe Constitution of Selveshas powerfully shaped the terms of the debate. Each of these philosophers defends a narrative model of personal identity as an alternative to physicalist or embodied theories, on the one hand, and psychological theories on the other. These latter approaches have tried to understand selfhood either by appeal to a self-identical<br>

  Chapter 4  Catherine Malabou: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2hjp">French Philosophy Today</a><br>
  Abstract: This second of two chapters on neurological transformations of the human will focus on epigenesis, a particularly fruitful notion for the elaboration of a non-reductive materialist account of the self. At the end of the previous chapter I drew a distinction between the mind–brain problem and the self–brain problem; in the present chapter I will take up that distinction in order to pursue the question of the identity of self (rather than the mind or brain) over time. In the previous chapter I considered how Malabou can overcome the tethering of the question of humanity as such to<br>

  Book Title: Imagining the Arabs-Arab Identity and the Rise of Islam<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Webb Peter<br>
  Abstract: Investigating the core questions about Arab identity and history, this book tackles the time-honoured stereotypes that depict Arabs as ancient Arabian Bedouin, and reveals the stories to be a myth: tales told by Muslims to recreate the past to explain the meaning of Islam and its origins.<br>

  3  Arabness from the Qur’an to an Ethnos from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: The novel appearance of
                  al-ʿarabin Umayyad-era poetry as a term of self-reference points decisively to the period when ideas of Arab communal consciousness gained wide acceptance to articulate a shared identity, but the verses alone do not explain why early Muslims during the later first/seventh century chose the name ‘Arab’ to identify themselves. The wordal-ʿarabappeared as an understood byword for the large collective – but where did early Muslims find the word and why did it become their ethnonym? These questions are important because peoples’ choice to identify as ‘Arabs’ would not have been idle: Arabness replaced<br>

  Imagining and Reimagining the Arabs: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bh2j7h">Imagining the Arabs</a><br>
  Abstract: By unfastening Arab identity from conventional cultural stereotypes, Bedouinism and ancient pre-Islamic Arabian bloodlines, this book sought to reveal the complexities and changing nature of historic Arab identity. The book was intended as an invitation to begin rethinking Arabness afresh, and by highlighting the shortcomings inherent in the static, monolithic manner in which historical Arab communities have often been discussed, our analysis sought to reappraise historic Arabness as an ethnicity, tracking its evolution and contextualising its development with close attention to the sociopolitical and ‘cultural stuff’ factors that sustain ethnogenesis.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g09ttm">Narrative and Becoming</a><br>
  Abstract: Ana Castillo’s œuvre is generally taken to be descriptive of Chicana culture and thus predominantly received in terms of ethnicity, feminism, and politics. As a result and as befits Chicana literary studies’ received tradition, Castillo scholarship is strongly thematic, with the themes of ethnic, sexual, and cultural identity taking centre-stage. Accordingly, the conceptual tools used for these thematic explorations are predominantly derived from postcolonial, feminist, and cultural studies with those of hybridity – or

  Author(s) Besley A. C. (Tina)<br>
  Abstract: Western philosophy has had a continuous engagement with the problem of subjectivity and with the self as a locus of both consciousness and experience – a question that is deemed to be open to understanding, analysis and philosophical reflection – ever since the first moments of institutional philosophy in Ancient Greece. The notion of the self has been an object of inquiry, a problem and a locus for posing questions concerning knowledge, action and ethics since Antiquity. Plato and Aristotle in different ways inquired of the self in terms that we understand today as personhood and personal identity, viewing the<br>

  Author(s) Boundas Constantin V.<br>
  Abstract: Philosophies of difference, where difference holds its ground without being subordinated to identity, are exceedingly rare. It is not by chance that the fortunes of philosophical heterologies are better served inside process philosophies. Although to be a process philosopher is not a guarantee that one will also be a philosopher of pure difference, movement and the reflection on movement that constitute the raison d’être of the philosophies of process offer a rich soil for the nurture of difference. But a process philosophy, in order to support a purely heterological thought, has to be capable of doing without subjects steering the<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1g0b1vg">The Edinburgh Critical History of Nineteenth-Century Philosophy</a><br>
  Author(s) Nassar Dalia T.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most obscure, yet significant, concepts in early nineteenth-century philosophy is that of the Absolute. As a word, the Absolute came into philosophical discourse with Schelling to mean the ontological ground of and point of identity between subject and object. In this sense Hegel adopted the term in his early works, while in his later writings he came to identify the Absolute with the process and final conclusion of reason. Although it is these figures who employed the words ‘the Absolute’ (

  Author(s) Pattison George<br>
  Abstract: In the first decade of the twenty-first century, religion once more became a prominent topic of public discourse and the language of religion, and of atheism, became the lingua franca in which key issues of the day were formulated. Whatever might be thought of the general level on which it has been taken up in our contemporary debates, this resurgence of religion facilitates the leap of historical imagination required to take us back to the intellectual climate of the nineteenth century, especially its first half. Then, as now, religion offered a crucial focus for debating fundamental issues of human identity<br>

  Abstract: Picking up on the discussion of identity and difference in ‘Measure: William Wordsworth’, this chapter focuses on deviance, a related topic. In order for a phrase to be deviant, it must be different from a more ordinary way of saying something similar or of employing the same construction. A similitude within dissimilitude is required here, as, if one were to see no resemblance between the ordinary and the deviant phrase, they would stand in no relation to each other at all, the one would not be recognised as a deviant form of the other (I shall go on to qualify<br>

  Abstract: Objects in each other form big things. The biggest possible thing is what we call the
                     universe. While the world is the reverse side or the form of each thing, the universe is a big thing, the identity of which is variable. The universe is always defined with a superlative: ‘the biggest thing’. Thus, we cannot conceive of a more important thing at the present moment, and we do not know if we will find a means to augment it further in the future.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Streete Adrian<br>
  Abstract: For the nineteenth-century French composer, Hector Berlioz, Shakespeare offered more than artistic inspiration. In fact, the playwright and his works acted as a prism through which the composer understood and rationalized his personal and professional successes and failures, indeed his very identity. Berlioz first discovered Shakespeare in 1827, an event he describes in his 
                  Memoires (1870) with typically Romantic effusion: “This sudden and unexpected revelation of Shakespeare overwhelmed me. The lightening flash of his genius revealed the whole heaven of art to me, illuminating its remotest depths in a single flash” (Berlioz, 1932, 66; see Schmidgall, 1990, 272–9; Cairns,<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the relationship between organisational discourse practices, power and resistance. It is concerned with the ways in which language is used to create and shape an organisation, to carve out an internal structure with circumscribed roles, responsibilities and rights for its different members, and for others with whom they interact. Covering institutional documentation, work discussions and routine talk, it also explores the discursive patterns of control and challenge as struggles for identity occur. We are interested in what has been defined as ‘institutional language’ (Thornborrow 2002; Drew and Heritage 1992) – talk that has pre-inscribed participant roles; is<br>

  Book Title: The Discursive Construction of National Identity-  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Unger J. W.<br>
  Abstract: How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? The Discursive Construction of National Identity analyses discourses of national identity in Europe with particular attention to Austria.In the tradition of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyse current and on-going transformations in the self-and other definition of national identities using an innovative interdisciplinary approach which combines discourse-historical theory and methodology and political science perspectives. Thus, the rhetorical promotion of national identification and the discursive construction and reproduction of national difference on public, semi-public and semi-private levels within a nation state are analysed in much detail and illustrated with a huge amount of examples taken from many genres (speeches, focus-groups, interviews, media, and so forth).In addition to the critical discourse analysis of multiple genres accompanying various commemorative and celebratory events in 1995, this extended and revised edition is able to draw comparisons with similar events in 2005. The impact of socio-political changes in Austria and in the European Union is also made transparent in the attempts of constructing hegemonic national identities. Key Features:*Discourse-historical approach.*Interdisciplinarity (cultural studies, discourse analysis, history, political science).*Multi-method, multi-genre.*Qualitative case studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Lacanian Left-Psychoanalysis, Theory, Politics<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stavrakakis Yannis<br>
  Abstract: In recent years psychoanalysis – especially Lacanian theory – has been gradually acknowledged as a vital resource in the ongoing re-orientation of contemporary political theory and analysis. Of particular note is that the work of Jacques Lacan is increasingly being used by major political philosophers associated with the Left. This indicates the dynamic emergence of a new theoretico-political horizon: that of the ‘Lacanian Left’. However, this has yet to be properly conceived and structured as a field. The Lacanian Left is the first book to bring it into academic consciousness and to draw its implications for concrete political analysis in a systematic way. It offers:• An accessible mapping of its main contours. • A detailed examination of the points of convergence and divergence between the major figures active or at the periphery of this terrain, including Slavoj h the central Lacanian notion of ‘enjoyment’, The Lacanian Left puts forward innovative analyses of political power and authority, nationalism, European identity, consumerism and advertising culture, de-democratisation and post-democracy. It will be of value to everyone interested in exploring the potential of psychoanalysis to reinvigorate political theory, critical political analysis and democratic politics.<br>

  Abstract: Although our contemporary world is marked throughout by the importance of questions of identity, something increasingly reflected in the directions of contemporary social–scientific research, in the general field of nationalism studies the issue of the attraction and salience of national identities has not been sufficiently examined. This is partly due to the hegemonic position of modernist and constructionist approaches in the relevant literature.² In opposition to the common doxa reproduced by nationalist myths, contemporary research on the nation tends to stress the constructed character of national identity: the nation is primarily understood as a modern social and political construction.<br>

  Abstract: I started the previous chapter with an observation regarding the importance that questions of identity have gradually acquired. It would be bizarre if the broad field of international relations were to stay untouched by this trend. In fact, no one is surprised any more by the fact that ‘the discipline of international relations (IR) is witnessing a surge of interest in identity and identity formation’ (Neumann 1999:1). The same applies to the sub-discipline of European Studies – affecting both marginal and mainstream approaches.

                  jouissance in its different modalities and interactions with the world of signification and social practice. Obviously the emergence of the ‘new’ cannot succeed if it ignores this important parameter, but this is not to say that sedimented, libidinally invested identifications are in any way privileged to retain their hegemonic position indefinitely. Processes of dis-identification and affective re-investment are, on the contrary, part and parcel of social and political life. In capitalist – especially late<br>

In stating

  Abstract: In the Akwapim kingdom of southeastern Ghana,¹ clothing is used as a form of communication to make statements about personhood and status; to conceal or reveal identity; to express desires and impulses. It may do so directly or indirectly, conventionally or rebelliously. Clothing is owned, bestowed and gives identity. The clothed body expresses the person of the wearer and society’s image of that person. As a result, clothing absorbs the particular times in which it has been worn² and becomes like a relic of these past events.<br>

In fact, if we subtract from their ranks those which, in their struggle to maintain the primacy of difference, succumb to the ineffable and turn their back on the creation of concepts, the number of philosophical heterologies turns out to be minuscule. And of course it is not by chance that the fortunes of philosophical heterologies are better served inside process philosophies. Although to be a process philosopher is not a guarantee that one will also be a philosopher of<br>

  Abstract: If magic is error for modernity, then the most scandalous of its errors is its collapsing into identity of words and objects. As Randall Styers argues, one of the central themes running through scholarly work on magic from the second half of the nineteenth century is the claim that magic is fixated on the power of words (Styers 2004: 219ff.). Certainly magic is often defined as that which attempts to animate matter, but again and again writers on magic assert a particular attitude to language as central to this animation. For James Frazer, if magic originates in the human fear<br>

The identity of the critical and the clinical expresses a more general turn in Deleuze’s philosophy towards a pragmatic, diagrammatic or cartographic theory of language which attempts to articulate a relationship between literature and the socio-political critique of power. Pragmatics does not replace but rather subsumes what Deleuze calls the ‘generative’, which we have discussed in terms of the psychosexual genesis of material bodies and immaterial signs, and the ‘transformational’, which we have discussed<br>

  Abstract: Joseph Conrad’s reputation predominantly rests on his proto-modernist exploration of the individual male consciousness. Throughout his fiction, protagonists such as Charlie Marlow, Lord Jim, Razumov and Axel Heyst are preoccupied with (frequently failed) quests for identity, isolated figures grappling with a troubled psychology, trying to make sense of their situation in a hostile or unwelcoming community. In this context, parties (other than political ones) do not immediately spring to mind as familiar locations or sources for Conrad’s narratives, and when they do occur they are not always markers of social harmony in his work.¹ His emphasis on the relationship between<br>

  Book Title: Post-beur Cinema-North African Émigré and Maghrebi-French Filmmaking in France since 2000<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Higbee Will<br>
  Abstract: Since the early 1980s and the arrival of Beur cinema filmmakers of Maghrebi origin have made a key contribution French cinema's representation of issues such as immigration, integration and national identity. However, they have done so mostly from a position on the margins of the industry. In contrast, since the early 2000s, Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers have occupied an increasingly prominent position on both sides of the camera, announcing their presence on French screens in a wider range of genres and styles than ever before. This greater visibility and move to the mainstream has not, however, automatically meant that these films have lost any of the social or political relevance. Indeed in the 2000s many of these films have increasingly questioned the boundaries between national, transnational and diasporic cinema, whilst simultaneously demanding, either implicitly or explicitly, a reconsideration of the very difference that has traditionally been seen as a barrier to the successful integration of North African immigrants and their descendants into French society. Through a detailed study of this transformative decade for Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France, this book argues for the emergence of a 'Post-Beur' cinema in the 2000s that is simultaneously global and local in its outlook. Its key features include: A comprehensive overview of the key developments in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking in France since the 2000s: counter-heritage cinema and the memorialisation of France’s colonial past; journey narratives and the myth of return; the ‘mainstreaming’ of Maghrebi-French directors and stars; representations of Islam. Detailed case studies of key films from the 2000s that have yet to receive scholarly attention, such as Hors-la-loi, Dernier maquis and Vénus noire. An in-depth analysis of trends in production, distribution and exhibition as they relate to Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmakers in the 2000s.<br>

  Abstract: Given the extent to which the integration of France’s North African Muslim population has been foregrounded in public debates over immigration, integration and national identity since the late 1980s, it is perhaps surprising that representations of Islam have remained marginal in Maghrebi-French and North African émigré filmmaking. This is even more so the case when it is considered that films by directors of North African origin have tended to foreground narratives addressing contemporary socio-political realities concerning the Maghrebi immigrant community and their French descendants. In other ways, however, this structuring absence of Islam since the 1980s finds a clear precedence<br>

By identity, we mean how we come to recognize ourselves and each other through group belonging.¹ All of us belong to certain groups: this is to say that we occupy subject positions. For example, street-level workers belong to various occupational groups and are recognized for their belonging to racial, class, gender, and sexual groupings. Each of these group memberships (for example, working-class, white, female, heterosexual) represents what we call a subject position. Each subject position is filled<br>

  Abstract: We are on the cusp of being able to better understand questions in International Relations hitherto considered unanswerable due to methodological limitations of the discipline. Methodology is vital to the enterprise of studying strategic narrative because the right methods allow us to explain how strategic narratives are formed, projected, received, and interpreted. Only then can we build explanations of the roles narratives play in persuasion, influence, identity-formation, alliance-building, order-shaping, and other major concerns of IR. There is a sense today among those practicing international relations that the rapid transformation of global political communication has opened up new opportunities to manage<br>

  Abstract: The symbolic representation of collective identity—an essential communicative element of nationalism—invariably involves the strategic deployment of narratives. An archetypical example in this regard is the creation and transmission of master commemorative narratives. In the nexus of Chinese domestic politics and foreign relations, such historical accounts are central to the internal and external legitimation of the nondemocratic state. By bestowing determined meanings upon the past, which is causally related to the present and future of the Chinese nation-state, this sort of strategic narrative defines the identity role of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in China’s sociopolitical development and projects<br>

  Abstract: Diverse archival aims mirror diverse uses of the past in general. At one extreme are disinterested efforts to learn and understand what has actually happened; at the other, partisan zeal to fabricate a past that suits present needs—to forge an identity, to secure a legacy, to validate a conquest or a claim, to prove a preeminence. The role of archives in these contrary goals is symptomatic, indeed, crucial. The conflict is exemplified today in a widening gulf between established archival repute and emerging archival reality.<br>

  Book Title: Race and the Making of the Mormon People-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): MUELLER MAX PERRY<br>
  Abstract: The nineteenth-century history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Max Perry Mueller argues, illuminates the role that religion played in forming the notion of three "original" American races-red, black, and white-for Mormons and others in the early American Republic. Recovering the voices of a handful of black and Native American Mormons who resolutely wrote themselves into the Mormon archive, Mueller threads together historical experience and Mormon scriptural interpretations. He finds that the Book of Mormon is key to understanding how early followers reflected but also departed from antebellum conceptions of race as biblically and biologically predetermined. Mormon theology and policy both challenged and reaffirmed the essentialist nature of the racialized American experience.The Book of Mormon presented its believers with a radical worldview, proclaiming that all schisms within the human family were anathematic to God's design. That said, church founders were not racial egalitarians. They promoted whiteness as an aspirational racial identity that nonwhites could achieve through conversion to Mormonism. Mueller also shows how, on a broader level, scripture and history may become mutually constituted. For the Mormons, that process shaped a religious movement in perpetual tension between its racialist and universalist impulses during an era before the concept of race was secularized.<br>

The

  Abstract: In the love verse of Durand and his contemporaries, a wayward rhetoric reverts to ultimate fidelity, only to rebound toward disjunction once again: and so the somersaults proceed, in a ceaseless chain. No matter how obliquely, the thematic subversions, puncturing devices, and playful inconsistencies of this poetry still portray, on a stylistic plane, the inner conflicts of a Petrarchist psychology. But this “metamimetic”¹ allegiance to the traditional

  Book Title: Storytelling in Siberia-The Olonkho Epic in a Changing World<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): HARRIS ROBIN P.<br>
  Abstract: Olonkho , the epic narrative and song tradition of Siberia 's Sakha people, declined to the brink of extinction during the Soviet era. In 2005, UNESCO 's Masterpiece Proclamation sparked a resurgence of interest in olonkho by recognizing its important role in humanity 's oral and intangible heritage. Drawing on her ten years living in the Russian North, Robin P. Harris documents how the Sakha have used the Masterpiece program to revive olonkho and strengthen their cultural identity. Harris 's personal relationships with and primary research among Sakha people provide vivid insights into understanding olonkho and the attenuation, revitalization, transformation, and sustainability of the Sakha 's cultural reemergence. Interdisciplinary in scope, Storytelling in Siberia considers the nature of folklore alongside ethnomusicology, anthropology, comparative literature, and cultural studies to shed light on how marginalized peoples are revitalizing their own intangible cultural heritage.<br>

  Abstract: Arguing that the "letting die" element of biopolitics has been overemphasized, Yasmeen Arif zeros in on biopolitics' other pole: "making live." She does so by highlighting the various means and the forms of life configured in the aftermath-or after
         lives-of violent events in contexts of law, justice, community, and identity. Her analysis of the social repercussions is both global and local in scope. Arif examines the convictions made in the Special Court of Sierra Leone, the first hybrid court of its nature under international criminal law. Next, she explores the making of a justice movement in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in 2002 in the state of Gujarat, India. From there she revisits the Sikh carnage in Delhi of 1984. Finally, she explores a span of civil violence in Lebanon, and particularly, its effects on the city of Beirut.<br>

Yet at this late stage of his career, Eisenstein becomes preoccupied with the issue of what he termed “great nothingness”—the opposite, the emptiness, the nonidentity against which we can define what is present and given.<br>

  Abstract: In a previous work, dedicated to a

One of the core chapters of that work noted the characteristics of identity and difference that mediate between text and metatext. In dealing specifically with the question of difference, the problem of defining language or the literary text was brought to the foreground, a classical problem that was not addressed at the time because the investigation wandered along other paths.

  Abstract: Chapters 1 and 2 situate the reader within the currents of history and intellectual thought that have influenced the ideas of national identity for both Portugal and Brazil. Although the two nations are treated separately in each chapter in order to highlight individual particularities, comparative allusions are made in order to illustrate the ways Brazil and Portugal impinge upon each other’s respective national identity formation.

Thus, we observe a shift from macrological approaches that have privileged constructs such as “racial democracy,” social typologies such as “the cordial man,” or geopolitical binaries such as the<br>

  Author(s) Lockhart Melissa A.<br>
  Abstract: José Hernández (1824-86), with his
                  Martín Fierro(1872 and 1879), is undoubtedly the emblematic author of Argentine identity. Critics and cultural essayists have been unable to resist constructing around him a series of supposedly national and spiritual values concerning what it means to be Argentine. At the same time, they have established the canonical character of a genre known as the gauchesque.² The theme of the gaucho has passed through various stages of transformation, even though not all works of the era are considered to be part of the gauchesque genre: from Hilario Ascasubi (1807-75) to Bartolomé Hidalgo (1788-1822) and<br>

  Abstract: This ambitious work explores the vexed connections among nation building, ethnic identity, and regional conflict by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military intervention in the ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. Postcolonial Insecurities counters the perception of “ethnicity” as an inferior and subversive principle compared with the progressive ideal of the “nation.” Krishna, in fact, shows ethnicity to be indispensable to the production and reproduction of the nation itself.<br>

  Abstract: This book is about the troubled and violent journey of postcolonial nationalism in South Asia. It examines the interaction between the modern enterprise of nation building and the emergence of ethnic conflict in this area by focusing on a specific event: Indian political and military involvement in the struggle between Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka. It argues that the attempt to construct nation-states on the basis of exclusionary narratives of the past and univocal visions for the future has reached an impasse.

  Abstract: In this chapter, I examine the production of a modern nation in Sri Lanka through a process that has been extraordinarily violent in both physical and epistemic terms. I do this primarily through a close analysis of a particular text authored by a former Sri Lankan president whose political career spanned most of the twentieth century, J. R. Jayewardene. If we are the stories we tell about ourselves, Jayewardene’s fable regarding the origins and evolution of Sri Lanka is interesting for the ways in which it produces a sense of identity out of difference. It is an encapsulation of history<br>

  Abstract: Like King, Baldwin is shaped profoundly by his experience in the black church, and he forges a language of love, suffering, and redemption that is both personal and political.¹ Like King, he exemplifies a “double-consciousness” toward both whites and blacks, whose entwined fates he can address partly because he refuses to be wholly defined by either. Like King, he works through a complex attachment to an “American” identity he links both to white supremacy and to a “promise” of overcoming ascription by “race, caste, and class.” Like King, he invests in African Americans a special responsibility for voicing and redeeming<br>

  Author(s) Liu Lydia H.<br>
  Abstract: The concept of the self, subject, or individual (as well as the slippage between them) has been a main target of criticism in the academic West since the emergence of poststructuralist scholarship. A good deal of that critique is bent on deconstructing the post-Enlightenment European notion of the subject. This move has been greeted with challenge by critics of deconstruction feminists and others who try to (re)introduce concepts such as political agency, strategic identity, and multiple subjectivities into the contemporary debate.1 As someone who specializes in a non-European language, I find this debate fascinating within the context of Euro-American academia<br>

  Abstract: The two volumes that constitute Deleuze′s inquiry into the cinematic image,

This milieu, in which the essence of a thing appears, is likewise the milieu of acinema-thinkingthat rescinds any phenomenological privilege from natural perception in order to lay itself open to the ″materialist programme″³ of a Bergsonian world.

  Abstract: In chapter 1 I argued that the

In particular, theMiller’s Tale“loosens” the class and gender hierarchies anchoring the body in theKnight’s Taleenough to imagine through its masochistic contract a body in motion, fluid and powerfully unpredictable in its representational flexibility. The identity positions offered by such an embodiment, however, bring with them both the reassuring prospect of participation in the construction of a properly dominant masculinity and the uneasy recognition of the instabilities that such an<br>

  Abstract: The discipline of international relations (IR) is witnessing a surge of interest in identity and identity formation.¹ This development has definitely been permitted and facilitated by the general uncertainty of a discipline that feels itself to have spent the 1980s barking up the wrong trees. A lack of faith in the old has made it easier for the new to break through. And yet because identity formation has been foremost among the common concerns of social theory for years and years, it is hardly coincidental that “the new” happened to take the study of identity formation as one of its<br>

  Abstract: A variety of others have been and are instrumental in the process of forging European identity. From the confrontations with Islam and the Spanish conquest of the “New World” to the scramble for colonial possessions at the end of the nineteenth century and beyond, European historians and philosophers have grappled with the clash between “infidels” or “barbarians” and “civilized” peoples (Harbsmeier 1985). Ethnically and culturally peripheral minorities also serve as internal others. Outstanding historical examples include Jews and Freemasons. The most important contemporary candidates for otherness, arguably, are the postcolonial immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.<br>

  Abstract: Whereas one of the main reasons for devoting the previous chapter to European representations of “the Turk” had to do with the historical centrality of such representations for European identity formation, one of the main reasons why this chapter discusses representations of “Russia” has to do with its sweeping contemporary salience. In addition to its centrality for overall discourse on European identity formation, the question of where Russia fits in is a central component of ongoing discourse on the European security order, and is frequently its focus. It is the central part of most day-to-day deliberations over institutional particulars, such<br>

  Abstract: For reasons that probably have more to do with quantity than with quality, in the international relations literature on regions, and particularly in the noneconomic literature, "Europe" is often not included as a region. Thus the two readings of how the self/other perspective may be brought to the study of identity formation at the Europewide level that were presented in Chapters z and 3 played themselves out in a "heterologue," with texts written mainly by historians. Once one turns to regions or, granting that Europe may just as well be treated as a region, subregions in addition to such texts<br>

The term “Central Europe” has not only become firmly entrenched as a term, but it has also contributed to propelling the states that ostensibly make it up to the forefront of the queue of EU applicant states. In its present incarnation, the discourse on Central Europe dates back to the 1950s, when intellectuals like Czesław Miłosz reopened the question of whether there existed a supranational identity in this<br>

  Abstract: The conclusion to Chapter 7, that “the East” has been cut loose from its geographical point of reference and has become a generalized social marker in European identity formation, is one that may also serve as an initial conclusion to the book as a whole. “The East” is indeed Europe’s other, and it is continuously being recycled in order to represent European identities. Since the “Eastern absence” is a defining trait of “European” identities, there is no use talking about the end of an East/West divide in European history after the end of the Cold War.

  Abstract: Boundaries abound. Between humanity and the gods. Between human and animal. Between culture and nature. Between life and death. Between genders, nations, peoples, times, races, classes, and territories. But boundaries have also become problematic today, perhaps more so than before. In a world experienced by many to be without a natural design to which they might conform, the function of boundaries becomes highly ambiguous. Boundaries form indispensable protections against violation and violence; but the divisions they sustain also carry cruelty and violence. Boundaries provide preconditions of identity, individual agency, and collective action; but they also close off possibilities of being<br>

On the contrary, it is a priority, given the “constitutional” moment that the European Union has been undergoing since the formal signing of the Constitutional Treaty and<br>

  Abstract: The authors begin with an overview of the extreme positions held by opposing camps in the debate over cinema: the "digitalphobes" who lament the implosion of cinema and the "digitalphiles" who celebrate its new, vital incarnation. Throughout, they remind readers that cinema has never been a static medium but a series of processes and transformations powering a dynamic art. From their perspective, the digital revolution is the eighth major crisis in the history of motion pictures, with more disruptions to come. Brokering a peace among all sides, Gaudreault and Marion emphasize the cultural practice of cinema over rigid claims on its identity, moving toward a common conception of cinema to better understand where it is headed next.<br>

  Abstract: Like many inherited historical concepts, republicanism has been understood differently in different contexts and at different times. This has resulted in confusion, polemic, and, most often, paradoxes that also have the benefit of adding depth and richness to the concept itself. So it is today. As used in France, republicanism refers to the political project that found its idealized representation in a vision of universal citizenship that is identified with the achievements of the Third Republic. In the United States, the concept designates the social community needed to provide a meaningful identity to the participants in a liberal polity organized<br>

This issue places crucial aspects of our humanity at stake since borders and boundaries are linked to the realities of inside and outside, inclusion and exclusion, questions of identity and difference. The current tendency of multiplying strategies for closure reveals that we have significant difficulties when it comes to different ways of configuring everything that has to do with the legal-political realm, citizenship, identity, or security.

  Book Title: Religion and the Specter of the West-Sikhism, India, Postcoloniality, and the Politics of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mandair Arvind-Pal S.<br>
  Abstract: Mandair rethinks the intersection of religion and the secular in discourses such as history of religions, postcolonial theory, and recent continental philosophy. Though seemingly unconnected, these discourses are shown to be linked to a philosophy of "generalized translation" that emerged as a key conceptual matrix in the colonial encounter between India and the West. In this riveting study, Mandair demonstrates how this philosophy of translation continues to influence the repetitions of religion and identity politics in the lives of South Asians, and the way the academy, state, and media have analyzed such phenomena.<br>

  Abstract: In the previous chapter I argued that it may be possible to break the cycles of repetition that produce identity politics centered around structures of transcendence. These structures have continued to govern the modern and postmodern (globalized) forms of Sikhism and Hinduism by limiting their engagements in the world to revivals or retrievals of an essence or an original identity. For Sikhs such a break can be effected through interpretations of texts such as the Guru Granth Sāhib, which are inherently capable of posing resistance to the

  Abstract: A Latin island set in a sea of Slavic neighbours, Romania is a country that has consistently felt close to identities and sources that were somehow out of reach.

  Abstract: In spite of the prevalence of ethical tropes in theoretical discussions in North Atlantic scholarly circles, an explicit embrace of the ethical turn in the humanities and social sciences has not been as prominent as that afforded to other so-called turns—including the cultural, linguistic, theological, psychoanalytic, and affective turns—of the past thirty years. Indeed, in contrast with previous turns, the ethical turn displays an almost apologetic reluctance about its self-identity: uneasiness and ambiguity define the attitude of many theoretical proponents of the turn, even if its political practitioners—humanitarians and human and animal rights advocates, among others—are<br>

  Book Title: Chinese History and Culture-Seventeenth Century Through Twentieth Century<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Duke Michael S.<br>
  Abstract: From Ying-shih Yü's perspective, the
      Dao, or the Way, constitutes the inner core of Chinese civilization. His work explores the unique dynamics between Chinese intellectuals' discourse on theDao, or moral principles for a symbolized ideal world order, and their criticism of contemporary reality throughout Chinese history. Volume 2 ofChinese History and Culturecompletes Ying-shih Yü's systematic reconstruction and exploration of Chinese thought over two millennia and its impact on Chinese identity. Essays address the rise of Qing Confucianism, the development of the Dai Zhen and Zhu Xi traditions, and the response of the historian Zhang Xuecheng to the Dai Zhen approach. They take stock of the thematic importance of Cao Xueqin's eighteenth-century masterpieceHonglou meng(Dream of the Red Chamber) and the influence of Sun Yat-sen'sThree Principles of the People, as well as the radicalization of China in the twentieth century and the fundamental upheavals of modernization and revolution. Ying-shih Yü also discusses the decline of elite culture in modern China, the relationships among democracy, human rights, and Confucianism, and changing conceptions of national history. He reflects on the Chinese approach to history in general and the larger political and cultural function of chronological biographies. By situating China's modern encounter with the West in a wider historical frame, this second volume ofChinese History and Cultureclarifies its more curious turns and contemplates the importance of a renewed interest in the traditional Chinese values recognizing common humanity and human dignity.<br>

  Abstract: In recent years, the May Fourth Movement has generally been identified as the Chinese Enlightenment. When Chinese authors first gave the movement this new identity in the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was clearly intended as a tribute of the highest possible order by way of analogy. Now that the twentieth century is over, however, the honor originally implied in that identity is fast becoming a dubious one. Indeed, now the dark side of the Enlightenment project centering on the idea of rationality is often perceived as a “failure,” or even worse, as a form of “domination.” It is<br>

  Book Title: Cosmopolitanism in Mexican Visual Culture-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>

  Abstract: Fernández organizes episodes in the history of Mexican art and architecture, ranging from the seventeenth century to the end of the twentieth century, around the consistent but unacknowledged historical theme of cosmopolitanism, allowing readers to discern relationships among various historical periods and works that are new and yet simultaneously dependent on their predecessors. She uses case studies of art and architecture produced in response to government commissions to demonstrate that established visual forms and meanings in Mexican art reflect and inform desires, expectations, memories, and ways of being in the world-in short, that visual culture and cosmopolitanism are fundamental to processes of subjectification and identity.<br>

  Abstract: After independence in 1821, the Mexican elites’ previous identification with Spain took the form of a general identification with Europe and later with the United States. This resulted in imitation of European and U.S. cultural patterns. Simultaneously, Mexico’s leaders continued to look at the most developed indigenous civilizations, especially the Aztec Empire, as episodes of their own past. This double identification of the Mexican upper classes with indigenous civilizations and also with foreign powers replicated in a postcolonial era the identity dynamics of the colonial period.<br>

  Book Title: Wicked Cinema-Sex and Religion on Screen<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Cutrara Daniel S.<br>
  Abstract: From struggles over identity politics in the 1990s to current concerns about a clash of civilizations between Islam and Christianity, culture wars play a prominent role in the twenty-first century. Movies help to define and drive these conflicts by both reflecting and shaping cultural norms, as well as showing what violates those norms. In this pathfinding book, Daniel S. Cutrara employs queer theory, cultural studies, theological studies, and film studies to investigate how cinema represents and often denigrates religion and religious believers—an issue that has received little attention in film studies, despite the fact that faith in its varied manifestations is at the heart of so many cultural conflicts today.Wicked Cinema examines films from the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, including Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Circle, Breaking the Waves, Closed Doors, Agnes of God, Priest, The Last Temptation of Christ, and Dogma. Central to all of the films is their protagonists' struggles with sexual transgression and traditional belief systems within Christianity, Judaism, or Islam—a struggle, Cutrara argues, that positions believers as the Other and magnifies the abuses of religion while ignoring its positive aspects. Uncovering a hazardous web of ideological assumptions informed by patriarchy, the spirit/flesh dichotomy, and heteronormativity, Cutrara demonstrates that ultimately these films emphasize the "Otherness" of the faithful through a variety of strategies commonly used to denigrate the queer, from erasing their existence, to using feminization to make them appear weak, to presenting them as dangerous fanatics.<br>

  Abstract: From the early 1920s to the late 1950s the dialectic of modernism and tradition, whether classical or vernacular, characterized the Italian state’s architectural patronage.¹ This essay investigates post–World War II state-sponsored building initiatives, mainly housing, and the architectural debates accompanying their design and realization. It sets them against the backdrop of Italian architectural discourse on identity that surfaced during the Fascist period (1922–1943) and continued to weigh heavily on the decisions of architects and urban designers in postwar democratic Italy.

  Author(s) PARKER TIMOTHY<br>
  Abstract: The essays in this section address a phenomenon that, from certain points of view regarding modern identity, remains virtually invisible. A long-standing trope of modernity is that it emerges insofar as religion, superstition, and their premodern cognates diminish. Thus, for instance, the modern world is roughly equated with not only the sociopolitical results of industrialization but also the philosophical implications of the scientific revolution and Enlightenment rationality, eventually yielding a disenchanted world, however incomplete its achievement may remain. Such a view is clearly reductive and simplistic, as the spate of “post-secularization” literature during recent decades in religious studies and elsewhere<br>

  Author(s): MINOW MARTHA<br>
  Abstract: Minow firmly rejects the prevailing conception of the self that she believes underlies legal doctrine-a self seen as either separate and autonomous, or else disabled and incompetent in some way. In contrast, she regards the self as being realized through connection, capable of shaping an identity only in relationship to other people. She shifts the focus for problem solving from the "different" person to the relationships that construct that difference, and she proposes an analysis that can turn "difference" from a basis of stigma and a rationale for unequal treatment into a point of human connection. "The meanings of many differences can change when people locate and revise their relationships to difference," she asserts. "The student in a wheelchair becomes less different when the building designed without him in mind is altered to permit his access." Her book evaluates contemporary legal theories and reformulates legal rights for women, children, persons with disabilities, and others historically identified as different.<br>

  Book Title: The Novels of Josefina Aldecoa-Women, Society and Cultural Memory in Contemporary Spain<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): KENNY NUALA<br>
  Abstract: Josefina Aldecoa, in her treatment of themes such as a woman's place in society under and after dictatorship, mother-daughter relationships, war, and memory, confirmed her unique role as a contemporary novelist concerned with women's identity in Spain and as a writer of the mid-century generation ('los niños de la guerra'). The first volume of her trilogy, Historia de una maestra, was one of the earliest narratives of historical memory to be produced in Spain. In this sense, Aldecoa's work anticipated new developments in gender studies, such as the intersection of feminist concerns and cultural memory. This book offers a comprehensive examination of Aldecoa's trajectory as a novelist, from La enredadera to Hermanas, centring on her primary preoccupations of gender and memory, arguing that Aldecoa's fiction offers a new, more complex understanding of women's identity than previously understood. The work combines the two dominating theoretical components of feminism and cultural memory with close textual analysis of Aldecoa's narratives. Her novels highlight the importance of the details of women's daily experiences and struggles throughout the twentieth century, a period of significant socio-political upheaval and change in Spain's history.

  Book Title: Interconnections-Gender and Race in American History<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Parker Alison M.<br>
  Abstract: This collection builds on decades of interdisciplinary scholarship by African American women and gender historians and feminist scholars, bridging the gap between well-developed theories of race, gender, and power and the practice of historical research. It reveals the interdependent construction of racial and gender identity in individuals' lived experiences in specific historical contexts, such as westward expansion, civil rights movements, or economic depression as well as national and transnational debates over marriage, citizenship and sexual mores. All of these essays consider multiple aspects of identity, including sexuality, class, religion, and nationality, among others, but the volume emphasizes gender and race--the focus of our new book series--as principal bases of identity and locations of power and oppression in American history.

Renaissance magic seemed to be a magnet, which possessed an extraordinary power to draw into its orbit a whole range of associations. Many feared magic as a dangerous adventure of curiosity into the realm of the devil. Faustus’s bold claims in these areas made him sensational, provocative, and, in his lifetime, admired at certain times, condemned at others.

  Book Title: El documental cinematográfico y televisivo contemporáneo-Memoria, sujeto y formación de la identidad democrática española<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): ESTRADA ISABEL M.<br>
  Abstract: Este libro evalúa la aportación del documental cinematográfico y televisivo producido en España a partir de los años 90 al debate en torno a la memoria de la represión franquista, por un lado, así como a la construcción de la identidad democrática, en términos más generales. Propongo que tanto los documentales con un enfoque histórico explícito como aquellos cuya mirada retrospectiva se realiza sin referentes tan concretos cuestionan el proyecto político teleológico concebido durante la Transición. La primera parte de mi estudio trata de la memoria histórica de la guerra civil específicamente y, la segunda, de la memoria en un sentido socioeconómico para apuntar el déficit de agencia del sujeto en la democracia neoliberal. En última instancia se reivindica la marginalidad social de la víctima a la vez que se deja al descubierto su obliteración de los procesos democráticos. Isabel M. Estrada is Visiting Assistant Professor, Franklin & Marshall College. ENGLISH VERSION This book examines how a selected group of documentaries made since 1995 for both film and television inform the debate centered on the so-called "recuperation of memory" of the Spanish Civil War and dictatorship. Estrada contends that these documentaries modify Spanish identity as it was conceived by the teleological historical project of the transition. The narrative of mass media should be examined in order to comprehend the process of the "recovery of memory" that culminated in the Law of Historical Memory (2007). She carries out a comparative analysis of the visual discourse of the documentary and the narrative discourses of history and testimony, paying special attention to the relations of power among them. Using theoretical frameworks provided by Badiou, Adorno, Renov, and Ricoeur, this study ultimately sheds light on the status of the victim in the context of Spain's neoliberal democracy. Isabel M.

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.

  Author(s): Allen N.J.<br>
  Abstract: Everyday nationalism, the human and cultural aspects of identity, is a neglected subject in the literature on nationalism in Europe. Jeremy MacClancy redresses the balance in this unusual and sharp book on the human and cultural aspects of the idea of being Basque in the modern world. The style is fresh and colloquial, dealing with several of the kinds of issues that usually appear in popular magazines - cuisine, football, art and graffiti - but the treatment is serious and illustrative of underlying currents in social life. MacClancy argues that the ethnographic understanding of nationalisms, rather than the orthodox studies of ideology, political parties, social classes and centre-periphery clashes - offers a more nuanced comprehension of the lived reality of people in areas where nationalism is a significant force. This is very much nationalism from the bottom up. JEREMY MACCLANCY is Professor of Social Anthropology at Oxford Brookes University. Series editors: Wendy James & Nick Allen<br>

  Abstract: Identity is a catch-all term of our times. It is an empty vessel which can be filled with almost any content. As a quick perusal of recent volumes on European communities shows, astute anthropologists can use identity as a general framing device for a surprising variety of ethnographic data. In these books discussion can span from the individual to the regional to the supranational, from styles of dress or dance to religious faith. The range of possible topics seems to be limited only by the imaginative power of the compiler. The worry, of course, is that we anthropologists may well<br>

  Abstract: It’s very simple. We are social beings. We are also animals. Problems begin when we try to tie those two statements together. The knot becomes tighter when nationalism is involved. Indeed it tends towards the Gordian when there appears to be a well-grounded biological basis to a certain ethnic identity, and questions of ‘race’ and thus of course accusations of ‘racism’, start to raise their head. The Basques are such a case. In this chapter, rather than lunge for a sword, metaphorical or otherwise, I wish to untie this particular knot piece by piece, and to assess the evidence as<br>

  Abstract: In October 1997 the Museo Guggenheim Bilbao opened in Bilbao to a blaze of fireworks and publicity. The fireworks died down but the publicity has persisted and, from its very first day, visitors have continued to pour in, in unforeseen numbers. Almost on its own, the Museo has radically changed the image of the city, modified the regional economy, and opened up important debates about Basque identity and the place of art within it. These debates show no signs of dying down. The local effects of the Museo have been so wide-ranging and, to a great extent, so unexpected that<br>

  Book Title: Dialogic Aspects in the Cuban Novel of the 1990s-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): DORADO-OTERO ÁNGELA<br>
  Abstract: This book examines six Cuban novels published between 1991 and 1999, all part of the new "boom" of the Cuban novel in the 1990s. It analyses how in undermining monolithic representations of reality these texts employ discursive techniques that question absolute truths, defy established boundaries of literary genres and challenge concepts of national, gender and individual identity. The authors studied in this book---Reinaldo Arenas, Leonardo Padura Fuentes, Abilio Estévez, Daína Chaviano, Yanitzia Canetti, and Zoé Valdés---are placed beyond the dichotomy of outside and inside Cuba in order to focus on the fluidity and heterogeneity of Cuban culture displayed in its literature. This study establishes similarities and differences in the way these authors create polyphonic texts that question whether notions of country and nation coincide in novels that respond to economic hardship, political and social changes, issues of cubanía, and exile.

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship. Silvio J. dos Santos is assistant professor of musicology at the University of Florida.<br>

  Abstract: By establishing a principle of identity between Berg and Wagner, this chapter is bound to cause suspicion, as it could rightly be argued that a person’s identity is formed by a multitude of factors—including the appropriation of historical or fictional narratives—by which the individual and collective identities are in a constant process of reconfiguration. To single out one element as

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt5vj797">Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"</a><br>
  Abstract: Berg’s fixation on constructing narratives of identity is reflected most overtly in his rendering of the character of Alwa, who is transformed into an opera composer, the “
                  WozzeckKomponist” (composer ofWozzeck),¹ from the original playwright in Wedekind’s play. This sort of self-identification was not unusual within his Viennese circle of friends; perhaps the closest model is Schoenberg’s identification with Moses in his operaMoses und Aron.² Yet Berg complicates his self-identification with Alwa because, as Patricia Hall has rightly argued, “many sketches for the Rondo suggest that on some level Berg associated the character of Alwa with Tristan from<br>

  Conclusion: from:

  Abstract: Berg’s fascination with Wagner,
                  Tristanin particular, complicates our understanding of his music because it underlies not only his creative identity and actions but also some principles behind his musical compositions. In his writings, Adorno often tries to draw a distinction between Berg and Wagner, but his explanations, while illuminating, only contribute to the problem. In his reevaluation of Berg, written about twenty years after Berg’s death, Adorno recognizes the “autonomy” of Berg’s works but points to a peculiar sort of metaphysics in which Berg’s music would emerge from underneath the music drama. In other words, Adorno draws a distinction<br>

  Abstract: Histories are never just neutral accounts of the past. Rather, past events are selected, shaped, and linked into narratives that are told in order to make sense of, and give meaning to, the present. Individuals, families, religious communities, political parties, and other groups use them as vehicles to communicate how they arrived where they are, how they want to be seen and understood. Above all, the cultural construction of these narratives, understood in the broadest possible sense, is one of the central planks in the formation of national identity, the collective myth-making which so often essentializes the otherwise contingent nation-state.<br>

  Book Title: Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Otero Solimar<br>
  Abstract: ‘Afro-Cuban Diasporas in the Atlantic World’ explores how Yoruba and Afro-Cuban communities moved across the Atlantic between the Americas and Africa in successive waves in the nineteenth century. In Havana, Yoruba slaves from Lagos banded together to buy their freedom and sail home to Nigeria. Once in Lagos, this Cuban repatriate community became known as the Aguda. This community built their own neighborhood that celebrated their Afrolatino heritage. For these Yoruba and Afro-Cuban diasporic populations, nostalgic constructions of family and community play the role of narrating and locating a longed-for home. By providing a link between the workings of nostalgia and the construction of home, this volume re-theorizes cultural imaginaries as a source for diasporic community reinvention. Through ethnographic fieldwork and research in folkloristics, Otero reveals that the Aguda identify strongly with their Afro-Cuban roots in contemporary times. Their fluid identity moves from Yoruba to Cuban, and back again, in a manner that illustrates the truly cyclical nature of transnational Atlantic community affiliation. Solimar Otero is assistant professor of English and folklore at Louisiana State University and is research associate and visiting professor at the Women's Studies in Religion Program at the Harvard Divinity School from 2009 - 2010.<br>

The little boy in the last stanza foreshadows and represents the Cuban nation yet to be born out of this sordid past. The two tropes, of violence and nature, provide an entry point for a discussion of the development of the use of the idea of the African citizen in constructing national identity in Cuba. This idea of the emerging Afro-Cuban citizen was reformulated through re-remembering race and<br>

                     Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre is a tour de force of identification, including multiple psychological identifications, mistaken identities, and the eventual union of sexual partners who are ideally matched but held apart by the exigencies of narrative and plot.<br>

                  Faust expresses Romanticism’s agony over the fact of individuation and the individual’s distance from its origin and destiny. Its action is propelled by a man’s desire to escape from selfhood into love. Faust does not end in a Liebestod, like Romeo and Juliet or Aida. Yet what is at stake is the continuation of Faust’s self-identity in time versus his dissolution, his Entgrenzung, in a timeless moment of bliss. The escape from selfhood into union with another, whether a lover, the world, or God, would be a Liebestod, and there are many echoes of the love-death theme in Faust,<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Deconstructions of Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdrich-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Rosenthal Caroline<br>
  Abstract: By analyzing the works of Thomas, Marlatt, and Erdrich through the lenses of subjectivity, gender studies, and narratology, Caroline Rosenthal brings to light new perspectives on their writings. Although all three authors write metafictions that challenge literary realism and dominant views of gender, the forms of their counter-narratives vary. In her novel 'Intertidal Life', Thomas traces the disintegration of an identity through narrative devices that unearth ruptures and contradictions in stories of gender. In contrast, Marlatt, in 'Ana Historic', challenges the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist a way out into a new order that breaks with the law of the father, creating a "monstrous" text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity. In her tetralogy of novels made up of 'Love Medicine', 'Tracks', 'The Beet Queen', and 'The Bingo Palace', Erdrich resists definite readings of femininity altogether. By drawing on trickster narratives, she creates an open system of gendered identities that is dynamic and unfinalizable, positing the most fragmented worldview as the most enduring. By applying gender and narrative theory to nuanced analysis of the texts, Rosenthal's study elucidates the correlation between gender identity formation and narrative. Caroline Rosenthal is Professor and Chair of American Literature at the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany. Her book 'Narrative Deconstructions of Gender' was published by Camden House in 2003.<br>

  Abstract: Over the last few decades, the concepts of “gender,” “identity,” and “narrative” have received growing attention in nearly every field of academic study. Gender has become an important analytical tool in many disciplines because of the insight it gives into the cultural orders underlying representations. Theories of subjectivity have illustrated that identity is not something we achieve and possess but something individuals must consistently reestablish in various social contexts and through a number of symbolic practices. One such symbolic practice is narrative. Through a coherent structure, and by drawing on familiar forms, narrative both constitutes and naturalizes concepts at the<br>

  Abstract: Identity is an all-pervasive and fundamental aspect of human life, and yet identity as a concept is one of the most hotly debated — contested and defended — concepts of our time. The term identity has its roots in developmental psychology and has only been the subject of critical debates since modernism. The notion of identity as a psycho-social entity only dates back about 100 years to the psychology of William James who differentiated an outer perspective, the “social self” (me) as the self recognized by others, from an inner perspective, the “continuous, inner self” (I) that denoted the self as experienced<br>

  Abstract: As the title 
                  Intertidal Life suggests, Audrey Thomas’s 1984 novel depicts the story of a woman who is caught in-between the erratic tides of convention and difference. In an attempt to construct a new identity for herself after a severe rupture in her life story, Thomas’s protagonist, Alice Hoyle, oscillates between traditional, socially accepted positions for women and new identities she imagines for herself. The title not only points to the plot but also to the textual devices of Thomas’s narrative that moves back and forth between fixture and fluidity, fact and fiction.¹ The laws and features of the intertidal<br>

  Abstract: For Daphne Marlatt’s 1988 book 
                  Ana Historic, Lewis Carroll’s writings are also important subtexts as they question conventions and playfully illustrate that what is real depends on cultural frameworks and individual perspective. As another contemporary Canadian woman writer who breaks down linguistic and narrative structures, Marlatt seems to share a lot of Audrey Thomas’s aims and strategies. Like Thomas, Marlatt disrupts surface structures to defamiliarize accepted notions of femininity and to question the coherence and continuity of gender and sexual identity. Both authors mirror the process of identity (de)formation in the narratives of their protagonists who are both writers themselves.<br>

  Abstract: As this study has shown, narrative can be both a prison house that enforces gender stereotypes, and a tool for imagining gender differently. Gender identity is informed by narrative that hides its ideological impetus by concealing the conditions for, and mechanisms of, its own construction. The texts chosen for this study render those mechanisms and thus reverse the naturalizing gestures of narrative, thereby also calling into question constructions of gender. They make possible different narrative constructions of gender that remain, however, visible as constructions because the novels are self-reflexive in their make up. If, as I argue in the framing<br>

  Abstract: In this article I examine the place of religious beliefs, and the interrelation between religion and gender, in a selection of twenty-first-century German-language prose fiction written by women. In line with the widespread recognition of a “ religious turn”¹ or “(re)sacralization”² that is transforming political and cultural discourse in the “post-secular society”³ in which we live, the role of religion in contemporary German-language literature is subject to increasing scrutiny. In German literary studies the depiction of Islam in Germanic culture and the history of German-Jewish identity currently receive much more explicit attention than the place of Christian faith.⁴ Julian Preece<br>

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

Identity, Goytisolo suggests, is intimately linked to one’s individual recall of the past set against the backdrop of the shared history of a community. Memory is the key to unlock this sense of identity by offering access to the past, from the perspective of the present, with a view to the future direction that the individual’s or community’s life may take. This is a phenomenological and non-teleological view, akin<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

It was followed by The Red Power Murders: A DreadfulWater Mystery in 2006.¹ The original front cover of DreadfulWater Shows Up sported only the pseudonym, but the author’s true identity would have been evident to devoted readers of King’s work: a small photo on the back flap showed the author as film-noir sleuth, complete with trench, fedora,<br>

  Author(s) Cox James H.<br>
  Abstract: Thomas king published major works prior to and simultaneously with a shift in the primary focus of American Indian literary critical inquiry from issues of culture and identity to questions of history and politics. Much of the early scholarship on King’s fiction, therefore, approaches it with an interest in identities and storytelling strategies and assesses its cultural, multicultural, and crosscultural character. The attention to American Indian intellectual, activist, and tribal nation specific histories by Osage scholar Robert Warrior (1995), Cherokee scholar Jace Weaver (1997), and Muscogee Creek and Cherokee scholar Craig Womack (1999) shapes more recent critical work, for example,<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/9781610441872">Fighting For Time</a><br>
  Author(s) Collinson Margaret<br>
  Abstract: The analytical significance of time has long been recognized in the natural science writings of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and in the philosophical tracts of Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, among others. Indeed an awareness of a past, a present, and a future, and of the finiteness of life are central features of human existence (Berger and Luckmann 1967). Human beings find meaning and identity in the temporal character of existence (Urry 1991, Collinson 2003). Yet it is only relatively recently that the importance of time has been acknowledged in theories of society (Giddens 1979, 1984, 1987; Adam 1990; Harvey 1990;<br>

  Author(s) HEISE DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: Symbolic interactionism (e.g., McCall & Simmons 1978; Stryker 1980) provides insights into how humans understand social events. Definitions of situations categorize settings and the people in them, narrowing a person’s attention to a constrained range of phenomena, a restricted set of identities and objects that guide understanding and anticipation of social events. Events are created and interpreted to confirm the situational meanings provided by the definition of the situation. People create events to establish identities, to maintain identities, and to restore damaged identities. Expectations for another’s behavior reflect his or her identity, and if an observed event does not confirm<br>

  Abstract: The history of this ‘Reader’ goes back to a meeting of a group of young scholars at the Balkan Summer University in Plovdiv in 1999. The lively interaction and debates engendered by this occasion highlighted the necessity of creating a common regional framework of intercultural dialogue. A year later, meeting in the same place, the idea of a ‘Reader’ containing a representative collection of fundamental texts that had contributed to and/or reflected upon the formation of narratives of national identity in Central and Southeast Europe was conceived. We envisioned this ‘Reader’ as a new synthesis that could challenge the self-centered<br>

  Book Title: Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals-The Quest for an Eternal Identity<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mylonas Christos<br>
  Abstract: This book is a comprehensive exposition of the interaction of a national (the Serbian people) and a religiou (the Orthodox Christian faith) content, in the formation of a distinctive national identity and a mode of being. Its interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, social anthropology, theology, political theory, Balkan historiography, and Serbian folklore, is deployed to provide a powerful and original analysis of how Serbian Orthodoxy has resulted in the sacralisation of the Serbian nation by framing the parameters of its existence. Addresses the following questions: what 'makes' a Serb? Are meaningful assumptions possible by introducing Serbian Orthodoxy as the primal point of reference? Why does religion appear to have an especially strong appeal?<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7829/j.ctt1cgf87j">Serbian Orthodox Fundamentals</a><br>
  Abstract: In untangling this complicated subject it will be helpful to resort to a simplified schema, founded upon the following point of departure: that religion—Serbian Orthodoxy, in this particular context—defines man and his place in the universe. In order to function effectively, it is essential that a person or group have a precisely focused and systematically conceived definition of its environment and of itself. Such a definition of the system and the cosmos to which it is related is a conception of identity. Orthodoxy can be understood only as an integrated system of thought, logically sound and epistemologically valid,<br>

  Abstract: Orthodoxy, as already suggested, through the dialectical interaction of her religious content—doctrinal and functional—with the national substance of the Serbian being, sacralises the identity of the latter in the confines of the human–divine communion. Spatial, sacramental, historical, temporal, aesthetic, and spiritual signifiers or referents of faith contribute toward the constitution of a holistic and objectified experience that permeates the nature of the national collectivity. A genealogy of right belief, underlined by the “mediative” presence of venerated patriots and the autocephaly of ecclesiastical institutions, concretise the convergence of the catholic and universal character of Orthodoxy into a unique<br>

  Book Title: What Holds Europe Together?-  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Michalski Krzysztof<br>
  Abstract: The book addresses contemporary developments in European identity politics as part of a larger historical trajectory of a common European identity based on the idea of 'solidarity.' The authors explain the special sense in which Europeans perceive their obligations to their less fortunate compatriots, to the new East European members, and to the world at large. An understanding of this notion of 'solidarity' is critical to understanding the specific European commitment to social justice and equality. The specificity of this term helps to distinguish between what the Germans call "social state" from the Anglo-Saxon, and particularly American, political and social system focused on capitalism and economic liberalism. This collection is the result of the work of an extremely distinguished group of scholars and politicians, invited by the previous President of the European Union, Romano Prodi, to reflect on some of the most important subjects affecting the future of Europe.<br>

  Author(s) LEGGEWIE CLAUS<br>
  Abstract: What sets the Europe Paper of the Reflection Group apart from many declarations on Europe is its clear rejection of an essentialist concept of culture—such as, for example, a (Christian) guiding culture—as the possible basis for both a collective establishment of identity and for practical integration policies. Europe is not some kind of cultural essence, but an open historical process and Europe’s identity has always been defined in de-centered and extra-territorial terms.

  Author(s) Wegley Andrew<br>
  Abstract: One linchpin that holds together Western modernity, the secularization thesis, is crucial in narrating the historical progress of society away from religious control to individual determination. The thesis can be seen as comprising six components: 1) the creation of different institutional apparati that separate religion from politics, 2) the depoliticization and privatization of religion, 3) the decline in religious belief, 4) the development of cultural identity, 5) the rise of the state as governmental form, and 6) the production of capitalist markets.¹ Together these components describe the new phenomenon that constitutes modernity as different from religious and traditional cultures.

Date: 09 2000<br>
Author(s): Lara Maria Pia<br>
Abstract: Lara’s book is thick with references and interwoven arguments and is sometimes hard to follow for this reason. She is concerned with showing the possibilities for a recognition of the importance of self‐fashioning narrative in Habermas’s own work, especially in his early analysis in
   The Structural Transformation of the Public. She takes up discussions of deliberative democracy to show how they are enriched by a recognition of the place of narrative; she takes up postmodern accounts of identity; and she pursues her argument through the work of Paul Ricoeur, Albrecht Wellmer, and Wayne Booth, as well as a host of others. Despite the density of the work, Lara succeeds in illuminating the relation between narrative, identity, and morality. If the question of how we should live is bound up with ideas of who we are, and if we shape who we are with the help of narratives of other lives, these ideas would seem to be an integral part of the normative question that Habermas asks as to how we should live with others. Lara’s book is not only a welcome addition to recent work on Habermas, but also an important participant in current discussions of the relationship between literature and morality.<br>

Journal Title: Ethics<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: et.2001.112.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 2001<br>
Author(s): Young, Jeffrey T.<br>
Abstract: Young’s new book on Adam Smith provides a careful textual analysis of Smith’s two major works:
      The Theory of Moral SentimentsandThe Wealth of Nations. Young argues, with good textual evidence, that Smith did not divide economics from moral theory and that, indeed, Smith thought of economics as a moral science. Young traces Smith’s economic and moral philosophy to Aristotle and Hume, and he points out, correctly, that “self‐interest itself had a significant moral dimension in Smith” (p. 173). Thus Smith’s alleged focus on self‐interest inThe Wealth of Nationshas normative dimensions not always recognized by all Smith scholars. Young uses Smith’s notions of the impartial spectator and benevolence as well as his theory of justice to link the two texts. This is a controversial conclusion since neither the impartial spectator nor benevolence is evident as an important concept inThe Wealth of Nations. Young also argues that Smith divides the economic sphere from the political sphere (see his matrix on p. 158), a questionable conclusion in light of Smith’s focus on political economy inThe Wealth of Nations. Young’s book also suffers from his apparently not having read Amartya Sen’s or my works on Smith, both of which make many of the same arguments Young develops. Still, Young has added further to the growing literature that reads Smith as a serious moral philosopher whose theory of self‐interest is far from libertarian and who neither divided economics from ethics nor politics from either.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: The necessity of both solidarity and proceduralism thus holds for both distributive and criminal justice. In the end, Ricoeur remains committed to notions that ground the just polity in community and mutual sharing without thinking that these notions require us to dispense with the formalism of procedures of justice. While the latter are not sufficient on their own to create or sustain a just society, while, indeed, formal procedures always presuppose some conception of the good, procedural conceptions allow us to recognize each other as subjects of rights. Although it is not always clear that Ricoeur succeeds in reconciling Rawls and Walzer or Habermas and Gadamer, he does provide a fresh perspective on current debates within his own interesting account of the structure of moral action.<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Abstract: This idea of the deliberate recovery of theological tensions by crossing religious boundaries can be understood in terms of the ecumenical concept of the complementarity of conflicting doctrinal formulations.

            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Whatever normative conclusions may be drawn in the end, theological ethicists ignore the unique situation of children and childhood at their own peril. Neglecting such marginalized groups as women and minorities weakened the voice of theological ethics in the past, both by silently playing into larger social wrongs and by failing to learn and grow from those silenced. Childhood in the United States and the world presents theological ethics today with a new and different but just as acute social challenge. Methodologically, since children cannot speak up as fully as can adults for themselves, theological ethicists should engage as deeply as possible with children’s actual social experiences, including through the sophisticated observational work of the human sciences, in order more creatively to understand and respond. Substantively, childhood demands at the very least renewed attention to the asymmetrical tensions of human moral responsibility, the senses in which others demand of those around them creative self‐transformation. This childist gesture of responsiveness and self‐critique has already begun to animate the human sciences. How much more, then, should it be welcomed and deepened further by Christian ethicists, who in one way or another trace a transformed world to the possibilities incarnated in an infant’s birth.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Instructive as his book is, Popkin could also have explored in greater depth yet the relationship between historical scholarship and expressions of the self. By focusing on autobiographies alone, he misses an opportunity to examine how such texts and scholarly publications related to (and possibly affected) one another, most notably in their divergent or convergent patterns of self‐representation. The boundary between autobiographical and scholarly writings may be more porous than Popkin intimates. Paul Hollander’s recent study of academic acknowledgments arrives, for instance, at conclusions that mirror Popkin’s regarding self‐representation and professional norms (“Acknowledgments: An Academic Ritual,”
   Academic Questions15, no. 1 [2001–2]: 63–76). Likewise, one could question why Popkin limited himself to the discursive analysis of published sources and “the motives that historian‐autobiographers acknowledge in their texts” (78). Autobiographies are also social practices that call for systematic research outside the text, in archival and published sources (and, perhaps, interviews as well). But Popkin is too good a historian not to know this. His book is by and about historians; it is dedicated to historians, but it is not only for historians. Its chief objective may well be to show how much the historian’s autobiography has contributed “to the literature of personal life writing” (8). In this respect as in many others,History, Historians, and Autobiographyis a success.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K. Conkin and John Higham, eds., New Directions in American Intellectual History (Baltimore, Md., 1979), 3-26. See also, in the same volume, David A.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured. While his chapters are full of relevant and interesting details of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 24 Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (Boston, 2000). 25 Butler, Becoming America, 9. 26 Butler, Becoming America, 36. 27 Butler, Becoming America, 22.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau. For reading the current essay, my particular thanks to Catherine Desbarats, Eric Jabbari, James Ron, and Michael Wasser, as well as to Tim Rowse, Desley Deacon, Ann Curthoys, and John Docker for helpful suggestions.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V. Y. Mudimbe, The Invention of Africa: Gnosis, Philosophy, and the Order of Knowledge (Bloomington, Ind., 1988). The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86.

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject.

There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76.

Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground. On Helmore's dismissal, see LMS-SA, 19/2/A: James Read to LMS Directors, Philipton, June 3, 1843. The LMS Directors overturned the dismissal and censured Philip. 37 An interesting point of contrast is provided by Janet Hodgson, "A Battle for Sacred Power: Christian Beginnings among the Xhosa," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh I HAVE SUGGESTED THROUGHOUT THIS ESSAY that the Comaroffs present nineteenth- century missionaries as fairly powerful figures, able to effect changes in the consciousness of Tswana interlocutors, despite the resistance of many. In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Abstract: Theorizing for theory’s sake certainly has its place, and not every book needs to be focused on practical issues. Nonetheless, even the most gymnastic theoretician needs some grounding connection to relevant cases. Reynolds is profoundly uninterested in this level of analysis. While he flies through the theoretical air with great speed in
   The Broken Whole, it is unclear whether the book can make any sort of stable or decisive landing.<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: In providing clarification of previous works,
   Reflections on the Justis exceptionally helpful. Of particular interest in this volume is the paradoxical nature of authority—What is authority? How is it legitimated? Is it claimed or granted?—the existence of vulnerability and passivity within autonomy and initiative, and the relationship between moral ideals and historical manifestation, questions that exist more on the margins ofOneself as Another. Those interested in Ricoeur’s religious thought will find little of direct interest here. Those who see a deep connection between his moral philosophy and his philosophy of religion will find some confirmation, but there are other places where the connections are more explicitly manifest.Reflections on the Justis best approached as a companion volume to earlier philosophical works, certainlyThe Justbut perhaps more importantlyOneself as Another. As such, it holds an important place in Ricoeur’s oeuvre.<br>

Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: Critchley uses the term in a discussion of Levinas and politics. Noting that government tends to become tyrannical when left to itself, Critchley commends the way Levinas’s ethical ideas can cultivate forms of “dissensual emancipatory praxis” that “work against the consensual idyll of the state, not in order to do away with the state or consensus, but to bring about its endless betterment” (“Five Problems in Levinas’s View of Politics,” 183).<br>

Abstract: AbstractThis paper isolates movement as a topic for analysis in Roman imperial history. Movement is regarded under three aspects: translation (of texts, practices, ideas), migration (of officials, merchants, students, etc.), and communication (i.e. the movement of written documents). Interrelationships among the three aspects of movement are identified and discussed, as are the shared impact of translation, migration, and communication on issues of cultural and social identity and political negotiation and control. The article argues that movement changes the role of the state as well as relations between individual and states, augments the use of writing in society, transforms identities, and gives impulse to internal and external regulations. The implications of movement are understood as both pragmatic and formal, altering relations to space and time and influencing ways of organizing and thinking. The author surveys current work in the field and identifies potential areas for future research. The paper draws heavily on both literary and documentary sources and discusses material from the late republic through late antiquity, paying particular attention to continuities and discontinuities between early and later periods of the Roman empire.<br>

Abstract: This essay brings together and builds upon histories of cold war American science and studies of objectivity, scientific personae, and the self by exploring the physicist Merle A. Tuve‘s career in the late 1940s and 1950s as a history of selfhood and the emotional dimensions of scientific identity. As director of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington after World War II, Tuve followed a convoluted path through the institutions, politics, identities, and sensibilities of science in the cold war, and he struggled to preserve a sense of meaning and identity centered on the humanistic and aesthetic possibilities of scientific inquiry in an era of rapidly growing instrumentalism. His predicament highlights not just the political and institutional shifts within postwar science, but also the intricate entanglements between feeling, selfhood, and the cold war order.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: Conventional views of text/music relationships in early Italian opera focus on the imitation of affections. But by dealing exclusively with the referential meanings of texts (e.g., emotions, images, and concepts) these views overlook an important aspect of music's interaction with language. In opera, music also imitates language's contextual and communicative functions—i.e., discourse, as studied today by the subfield of linguistics called pragmatics. In his operas Monteverdi fully realized Peri's ideal of “imitating in song a person speaking” (“imitar col canto chi parla”) by musically emphasizing those context-dependent meanings that emerge especially in ordinary language and that are prominent in dramatic texts, as opposed to poetry and prose. Such meanings are manifest whenever words such as “I,” “here,” and “now” appear— words called “deictics”—with the function of situating the speaker/singer's utterances in a specific time and place. Monteverdi highlights deictics through melodic and rhythmic emphases, repetition, shifts of meter, style, and harmony, as part of a strategy to create a musical language suited to opera as a genre and to singers as actors. In
         Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patriaandL'incoronazione di Poppea, this strategy serves large-scale dramaturgical aims with respect to the relationships among space, time, and character identity, highlighting issues also discussed within the contemporary intellectual context.<br>

Abstract: Walter Pater's theoretical "come-back" over the past forty years or so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread Imaginary Portraits, "Sebastian van Storck" (1887), explores the basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially "theological" trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the "identity" that it modestly claims to have merely discovered. Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism- equation-I venture that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence, metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in a post-deconstructive ethics.<br>

Abstract: The L.D.S Church's use of commemorative rituals and narrative history to simultaneously adapt and maintain identity is not unique, but it is uniquely available to analysis because of the immediacy of the change and the Saints' devotion to record-keeping. Thus, the drama of LDS survival during the Progressive Era illuminates age-old religious strategies for adaptation to social norms, which strategies preserve the faithful's confidence in the timelessness of their god's moral and ecclesiastical order. More narrowly, these events in American church history are critical for understanding how the civilly disobedient Saints finally accepted the rule of federal law without losing their religion.<br>

Abstract: Research on identity suggests that a critical factor in identity concerns presentation or the behaviors actors perform in order to convince others of their identity. Yet identity also involves the attributions others make on the basis of these behaviors. In this paper, I argue that all acts do not fare equally in the process of attribution. Rather, individuals making attributions engage in a process of mental weighing as a way to determine which acts “count” toward identity and to what extent. While various components of the act contribute to its social weight—its presence or absence, markedness, frequency, context, and the manner in which it is performed—the lens through which the attributer views the act also influences the weighing process.<br>

Abstract: This article combines a narrative approach on life histories, inspired by Paul Ricoeur, with the symbolic interactionist approaches of George Herbert Mead and Erving Goffman. It focuses on "negotiations" in qualitative interviews with alcoholics, that is, narrative sequences in which the interviewee's line comes into conflict with the line of the interviewer. From a larger study of drinking careers among alcoholics in Copenhagen, two interviews are singled out for a more detailed analysis. The two interviewees did not live up to the (implicit) expectations of the study: the presumptions (a) that persons contacted at institutions for heavily addicted alcoholics do indeed identify themselves as alcoholics and (b) that alcoholics are interested in structuring their life histories according to the development of their drinking problems. By struggling to defend an alternative identity for themselves than the one the interviewer had in readiness for them, the interviewees laid bare the (problematic) therapeutic framework of the study.<br>

Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Abstract: In the formation and composition of what might be termed personal identity a key but often neglected aspect is ideal identity. While comprising aspirations rather than realities, it makes a major contribution to the definition of self-identity. It does this as a result of: (a) clarifying what kind of person the individual wishes to be; and (b) an interrogation of how she sets about achieving her ideal identity, intimating what kind of person she is at a particular moment by virtue of the way in which she strives to achieve her ideal. The article argues for a re-appraisal of the notion of ideals in education and for its reinstatement as a significant feature of education. Indeed, we argue, children cannot avoid ideals--they are presented to them everyday from a wide variety of sources. But these sources or the ideals that they promote are not necessarily good for the child's well-being or for her fellow citizens. Consequently, teachers as moral agents have an important role in assisting children to acquire ideals that do meet such a criterion of goodness in addition to helping them reflect critically on the range of ideals they may encounter in their communities and society.<br>

Abstract: The cross-cultural program of research presented here is about matters of temporal persistence-personal persistence and cultural persistence-and about solution strategies for solving the paradox of "sameness-in-change." The crux of this paradox resides in the fact that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognizable as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two constitutive conditions. The first of these is that selves are obliged to keep moving or die, and, so, must continually change. The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical. Although long understood as a problem demanding the attention of philosophers, we argue that this same paradox arises in the ordinary course of identity development and dictates the different developmental routes taken by culturally mainstream and Aboriginal youth in coming to the identity-preserving conclusion that they and others are somehow continuous through time. Findings from a set of five studies are presented. The first and second studies document the development and refinement of a method for parsing and coding what young people say on the topic of personal persistence or self-continuity. Both studies demonstrate that it is not only possible to seriously engage children as young as age 9 or 10 years in detailed and codable discussions about personal persistence, but that their reasoning concerning such matters typically proceeds in an orderly and increasingly sophisticated manner over the course of their early identity development. Our third study underscores the high personal costs of failing to sustain a workable sense of personal persistence by showing that failures to warrant self-continuity are strongly associated with increased suicide risk in adolescence. Study four documents this same relation between continuity and suicide, this time at the macrolevel of whole cultures, and shows that efforts by Aboriginal groups to preserve and promote their culture are associated with dramatic reductions in rates of youth suicide. In the final study we show that different default strategies for resolving the paradox of personal persistence and change-Narrative and Essentialist strategies-distinctly characterize Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth.<br>

Abstract: The Euro-American philosophical traditions offer two extreme positions to the problem of identity over time: G. W. Leibniz' essentialism and Derek Parfit's reductionism. A third alternative conception of personal identity is presented here, more appropriately named personal nonduality, which is based on Nishida Kitarō's conception of personal unity as nonrelative contradictory self-identity.<br>

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manyness are thoroughly corelative, joined in a dialectical relation of reciprocal implication. This pluralized unity and unified plurality is the ontological matrix of truth's relativity. Symbolic awareness is the interface of contextual meaning and relational being. The density of constitutive relations and the nascence of concrete actuality engender a dissonance between manifest and latent content in the reflection of being in consciousness. The polysemy of symbols captures the polymorphism of being in a way that establishes the need for a constant process of decipherment in which we reformulate our notions in order more fully to penetrate synchronic and diachronic relations that are ontologically definitive. By maintaining the tension between the revealed and the concealed, symbolic awareness insures that knowledge always evolves through ceaseless reinterpretation. For symbolic consciousness, truth, as being itself, forever becomes. The essay concludes with the suggestion that the wedding of a relativistic epistemology and a relational ontology in a symbolics of the religious imagination reopens the possibility of constructive theological reflection in a pluralistic age.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines, from the point of view of an existential hermeneutics, five accounts of transpersonal experience: Robert Monroe's Journeys Out of the Body, Paul's experience in the third heaven in II Corinthians 12, a description of rapture by Teresa of Avila, a disembodied vision of guardian spirits by John Lilly from The Center of the Cyclone, and the vision of the assault of the Lords of the Dead from the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Through a consideration of world, embodiment, death, care and other existential categories, the discussion in each case focuses on a central ambiguity about the personal identity of the narrator. The question of authenticity, in a Heideggerian sense, is posed to these materials, and the central ambiguity is shown to strike so deeply as to undercut the assumption of autonomy as the criterion of authenticity. Being-toward-death is relativized in such experiences, but relativized by an even more radical threat to individual existence. In conclusion, some generalized principles are offered as heuristic criteria for interpreting transpersonal experience in general.<br>

Abstract: Taylor, it has to be noted, would presumably quarrel
with this "either/or" formulation, either interpret the
classics or interpret the world. His Hegel book obvi-
ously falls within the genre of commentary on the tradi-
tion. Furthermore, in the preface to its condensation as
Hegel and Modern Society, he emphasizes the relevance
of Hegel's political philosophy to our time (1979, pp. xi-
xii)

Abstract: This paper focuses on the revival and reconstruction of polyphonic settings of the Latin Mass in selected villages in Corsica. Many such mass settings, often unique to a single village and preserved only in oral tradition, fell into disuse during the first half of the 20th century for a variety of reasons that are briefly explored. In some cases, however, fragments remained in the memories of surviving singers or on old recordings and these were to provide the seeds for the repertoire's later renaissance. My account of the processes of retrieval, reconstruction and re-absorption of the musical material itself is balanced by an examination of the different motives and ideologies of the various parties involved, together with an exploration of the broader theoretical implications of the enterprise of reclaiming the musical patrimony and, in particular, what it reveals about attitudes towards the past, authenticity, ownership and local identity. In the course of my analysis I draw on a series of metaphors and paradigms from the fields of archaeology and heritage conservation. Ultimately, I argue that the renewed practice of singing the mass in the "old way" should be viewed as an authentic part of the Corsican present.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained as a result of being out of place and not quite right.<br>

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: Schwartz argues for the later rabbinic development of practices related to death: "Indeed, if it
is the case that even strongly 'Jewish' Jews were often buried without the accompaniment of Jewish
iconography—that despite what we are accustomed to think about such liminal moments as birth,
death, marriage and so on, death was not yet generally an occasion among Palestinian Jews for
strong public affirmation of group identity—then Beth Shearim shows that the judaization of
Jewish burial practice was now (third-fourth century) underway in some circles" (2001: 154).<br>

Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Abstract: This article proposes using the theoretical discussions of Deleuze and Guattari as a means of comprehending the various ways in which individuals speak about their ethnic identity. This is done through a case study of a state-run educational boarding school offered to subjects identified as 'ethnic' in Israel. The findings expose two ways of talking about ethnic identity: 'minor language' and 'major language'. What I term the 'major language of ethnicity' makes substantial use of state language and offers two hierarchical categories that serve as an archetype for classifying groups. The 'minor language of ethnicity', on the other hand, offers multiple local identifications and potential identity alternatives. The article suggests using dynamics at the foundation of these concepts to consider the position of the researcher and to expose existential 'lines of flight' and life inventions of subjects in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Slave narratives, in general, and Frederick Douglass’s works, in particular, have created a serious difficulty for their modern readers and interpreters as representations of the otherwise silent community of black slaves. Silence here denotes their inability to enter certain domains of discourse. Thus, they appear` silent despite the rich African American traditions of music, song, and story-telling, which helped to preserve their cultural identity but could not be written into the mainstream culture. The article poses questions concerning the ability of one intellectual voice to represent the collectivity of black experience and of black slaves. This does not diminish the literary value of Douglass's writing but undermines the use of it as a historical document<br>

Abstract: It has been argued that in higher education academic disciplines can be seen as communities of practices. This implies a focus on what constitutes identities in academic culture. In this article I argue that the transition from newcomer to a full participant in a community of practice of physicists entails a focus on how identities emerge in learning how to highlight certain aspects of personal life histories. The analysis of interviews with 55 physicists shows that physicists often perceive experiences in their childhood as the first step into their professional identities as physicists. These experiences involve recollections of the ability to think scientifically (e.g., 'go beyond the surface'), and the ability to play with toys which can be connected to the practical life of physics. The process of identity formation can be described as developing in a relational zone of proximal development, where old-timers recognize particular playful qualities in newcomers as a legitimate access to a physicist identity. The article discusses how play which physicists connects with a scientific mind can constitute a relational zone of proximal developments in a community of practice as a particular "space of authoring" in a physicist culture, which cut across other cultural differences. Il a été admis que les disciplines de l'éducation supérieure peuvent être considérées comme des communautés de pratique. Cela pose la question de savoir comment se constituent les identités dans la culture académique. Dans cet article, pour mettre en évidence la transition de nouveau venu à participant à part entière dans une communauté de pratique de physiciens, j'examine non seulement la manière dont des identités émergent au travers des pratiques, mais aussi les aspects biographiques que les participants identifient comme ayant facilité leur transition. Une cohorte de 55 physiciens a été interviewée et leurs analyses ont été comparées à des données supplémentaires, notamment tirées d'une observation participante d'étudiants en physique. Les physiciens identifient souvent des expériences de leur enfance comme premiers pas vers leur identité professionnelle de physiciens. Ces expériences requièrent une pensée de type scientifique et une capacité à jouer liée avec les pratiques de la physique. Le processus de formation identitaire peut être décrit comme se développant dans une zone relationnelle de développement proximal, dans laquelle les aînés reconnaissent les qualités ludiques des nouveaux venus comme légitimant leur accès à l'identité de physicien. L'article discute la manière dont le jeu, que les physiciens associent à l'esprit scientifique, constitue une zone de développement proximal dans une communauté de pratique, comme «espace d'auteur» dans la culture des physiciens — laquelle peut par ailleurs dépasser d'autres différences culturelles.<br>

Abstract: This article examines Campbell's concept of 'foreign policy' and its application to identifiers 'below' those utilized by Campbell. Campbell's discussion of 'foreign policy' at the level of the ruling elite, though perhaps necessary for the historical breadth of his analysis, provides a skewed and privileged understanding of both national identity and its creation. Through an analysis of 'foreign policy' at the sub-elite level, using the three versions of The Quiet American as illustrative examples, this article demonstrates that a separation of 'foreign policy' from Foreign Policy can yield multiple potentially conflicting national identities. While at times taking on the form of an argument ad absurdum, it is not the intent of this article to disprove Campbell's work. Rather, its intent is to use the concept of 'foreign policy' with a different level of identifier to demonstrate that the tenuousness and indefiniteness of national identity are actually greater than those proposed by Campbell.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the ethical implications of recent changes in social work, particularly in relation to the conception of social workers as professionals guided by a code of ethics. These changes include the fragmentation of the occupation, the increasing proceduralization of the work and the growing focus on consumer rights and user participation. Some people have argued that codes of ethics are becoming increasingly irrelevant in this climate, in that they assume a unified occupational group and are based upon professionals' definition of values without consultation with service users. On the other hand, it has also been maintained that it is ever more important to retain and strengthen codes of ethics in order to maintain professional identity and to defend the work of the profession from outside attack. This paper explores the relevance of a code of professional ethics for social work, focusing particularly on the British Association of Social Workers' code, in the context of the changing organization and practice of the work. It considers two alternative approaches: the 'new consumerism' which focuses on the worker's technical skills (rather than professional ethics) and consumer rights (as opposed to professional obligations); and a 'new radicalism' which stresses the worker's own personal or political commitment and individual moral responsibility (as opposed to an externally imposed code of professional ethics). It is concluded that the changes in social work do threaten the notion of a single set of professional ethics articulated in a code, and that, in some types of work, this model is less appropriate. However, there is still mileage in retaining and developing a code of ethics, not as an imposed set of rules developed by the professional association, but as part of a dynamic and evolving ethical tradition in social work and as a stimulus for debate and reflection on changing and contradictory values.<br>

Abstract: Most accounts of social work values contain two central conceptual strands: social work ethics and anti-discriminatory practice. Within social work, relatively little attention has been paid to the potential of feminist approaches to ethics, grounded in identity to bring these two strands together. Narrative ethics is an approach which, like the feminist ethic of care, takes identity as its starting point and therefore has the potential to bridge these two distinctive approaches to social work values. However, in asserting the centrality of narrative in the construction of our identities, it moves beyond the feminist approach. Narrative approaches to ethics have been widely adopted in medicine. This paper explores their applicability to social work practice, particularly in the light of an increasing interest in narrative as a basis for practice intervention.<br>

Abstract: This article argues that the concept of 'identity' is of limited heuristic value and proposes that it may instead be more useful to deploy the notion of narratives of location and positionality for addressing the range of issues normally thought to be about collective identity. Location and positionality (and translocational positionality) are more useful concepts for investigating processes and outcomes of collective identification — that is, the claims and attributions that individuals make about their position in the social order of things, their views of where and to what they belong (and to what they do not belong) as well as an understanding of the broader social relations that constitute and are constituted in this process. This enables a complete abandonment of the residual elements of essentialization retained even within the idea of fragmented and multiple identities so favoured by critics of unitary notions of identity. The article will draw on research into the ways in which experiences of 'race' and ethnicity were articulated in the narrations produced by British-born youngsters of Greek Cypriot background.<br>

Abstract: Mythical configurations of a personal deity and a dominant sexual identity are part of our western history. In particular, the religious myths of patriarchy have privileged a male God and devalued female desire—and, with her desire, sexual difference. There can be no facile way beyond these myths. Instead the proposal here is for feminist theologians to attempt new configurations of old myths and disruptive refigurations, i.e. transformative mimesis, of biased beliefs. Myth and mimesis can enable expression of multiple identities. Only identities-in-process preserve the possibility for a peaceful revolution of our desires and our differences, religious and sexual.<br>

Abstract: In spite of limited resources, intellectual diversity, and arguments that texts are overrated as a method and object of study, this essay argues that religion and literature maintains a vital and even subversive identity by its commitment to the text. After challenging Lawrence Sullivan's argument against the 'tyranny of the text' in religious studies, I sketch three dimensions of texts that concern religion and literature as I see it: the aesthetic, the critical, and the transcendental. With an emphasis on the subversive function of religion and literature, I apply a hermeneutic of suspicion to these dimensions of text through two metaphors: the wig (la perruque) and the veil.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the combination of theology and humanism by reflecting on Christian identity. Beginning with Paul Ricoeur's theory of fiction as a laboratory of 'imaginative variations' on the possibilities of ethical selfhood, I ask: if the world projected by the Christian scriptures overturns human possibilities, what happens to the Christian self's ethical responsibility? I analyse the motion pictures Fight Club, Memento, and The Matrix to interpret extreme cases or 'unimaginable variations' on the theme of conversion among broken, fragmented, and manipulated selves. I argue that The Matrix presents a form of conversion most conducive to fulfilling ethical responsibility.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur's book Oneself as Another, represents a major achievement in the development of a philosophy of selfhood. By dialectically linking the self to otherness, others, and the Other, Ricoeur makes a substantial move beyond Modern philosophical theories of identity and selfhood. However, contrary to Ricoeur's own intentions, his unique formulation of selfhood defined in terms of the power-to-do, or conatus, ultimately inscribes the other within the circle of the self-same, and thereby fails to let the other be other.<br>

Abstract: Examining the relevance of communitarian thought for feminist theory, this essay considers the idea of narrative identity in certain types of communitarianism and feminism. It claims that the particular way in which the idea of narrative identity is elaborated raises difficulties for a feminist understanding of gender identity. The syncretic and over generalised idea of narrative identity derived from communitarian thought ode snot adequately grasp important aspects of the ways in which gender inequalities are constructed.<br>

Abstract: Si comme Foucault lui-même le souligne, la question de la vérité occupe dans
toute sa recherche une place à différents égards cruciale (Foucault 1994 III : 30-
31, IV : 693), ce n'est qu'à partir des années 1980 qu'elle devient ensemble à
la problématique du sujet la préoccupation principale du philosophe. En effet,
déjà dans ses recherches sur la sexualité, Foucault s'est intéressé à une forme
particulière d'assujettissement à l'œuvre dans la pastorale chrétienne et qui sera
par la suite un modèle exemplaire pour les actions disciplinaires (Foucault 1994
III: 256-257, IV: 125-129, 148, 383-385, 783-788). Le sujet est contraint
d'avouer la vérité sur sa vie la plus intime, et notamment celle sexuelle, « pour
mieux renoncer à lui-même et se soumettre à son directeur de conscience » (Granjon
2005 : 42). Il s'agit d'un processus de formation du sujet dans un rapport à soi
aliéné. Selon FOUCAULT (1994 III : 551), ce modèle de formation du sujet est à
l'œuvre également dans « toutes les grandes machines disciplinaires : casernes,
écoles, ateliers et prisons [...] qui permettent de cerner l'individu, de savoir ce
qu'il est, ce qu'il fait, ce qu'on peut en faire, où il faut le placer, comment le
placer parmi les autres ». En 1980 lors d'une leçon au Collège de France pour
le cours intitulé « Du gouvernement des vivants », Foucault (2012 : 80-81) refor-
mule la question de la formation du sujet dans les termes de « régimes de vérité ».
Les années 1980 représentent un tournant dans les orientations analytiques du
philosophe. Dans un article paru en 1981, FOUCAULT (1994 IV : 693) annonce son
projet de recherche à venir, toutefois interrompu par sa mort prématurée. Il
reviendra à plusieurs reprises sur ce changement de thème directeur en essayant
aussi de montrer qu'il était sous-jacent dans ses recherches antérieures.<br>

Abstract: This article offers a genealogy of the impact of French and Francophone Studies during the past decades in order to offer suggestions about how the field might be reconfigured and re-imagined in the present. We argue that the best way forward will be to dispense with traditional boundaries and borders within the field and instead embrace a general identity as Francophonists in order to bring together work on and from different regions of the globe.<br>

Abstract: While identity researchers are utilizing a variety of methods, the potential advantages of combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods remain largely unexploited. This article discusses the interplay of methods, theoretical content and meta-theoretical assumptions in identity research and calls for the use of mixed methods. The article applies a symbolic interactionist perspective and discusses what aspects of identification different methodological approaches provide insight into. It is discussed how different methodologies imply different assumptions about identity, particularly regarding the stability of identities, the constitution of identities and the conception of meaning. The influential quantitative Burke–Tully approach is brought into focus and compared to different qualitative approaches, particularly narrative interviews. A quantitative self-report measure neglects the narrative, performative and embodied quality of identification. However, the quantitative approach of Burke and Tully enables the systematic, standardized comparison of individuals making it possible to examine patterns of identification in large populations. Since different methods enable the study of different aspects of identity, while remaining blind to other aspects, mixed methods may contribute to more complete insights into identity processes. Importantly, mixed methods may be used to examine patterns available to the outside observer and the lifeworld of the individual actor and thus to both explain and understand.<br>

Abstract: The author argues that Casanova's journey to Venice constitutes not only a physical journey, but also an inner quest that brings significant insights. A close analysis of the dream sequence as a condensed version of the novella's plot reveals the protagonist's disillusionment with the obsolete public persona in which he is trapped, a reluctant recognition of an inner void, and a paralysis in his futile pursuit of a new identity, qualities which capture the fin-desiècle Viennese Weltanschauung.<br>

Abstract: Interestingly enough it appears that the structural features of reconciliation show a re-
versed version of the structural features of evil. Resolving the evil I do toward the other re-
quires that I am able to say what I have done wrong (the reverse of silence and the
tinspeakable), that I recognize my guilt (which is incompatible with splitting) and that I ask for
forgiveness (which is very shameful, but may résolve shame when penitence is accepted and
forgiveness is given); see Glas (in press); Muφhyand Hampton (1988); Volf (1996).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

worldview. Whether or not we realize it, we all have certain presuppositions and biases that

vision or alter the way we perceive the world around us.' (http://christianworldview.net/,

Abstract: The struggles for recognition, focused on cultural and identity issues until recently, are returning to public arenas in the form of struggles for legal recognition, precisely when we are witnessing, in the context of the post-2008 economic recession, a downward review of citizenship rights, in particular social and labour rights. This article discusses this issue by: first, associating education to the struggles for legal recognition, using the «moral grammar of social conflicts» of Axel Honneth; second, showing how education, connected to empowerment, may have an interesting role in the qualification of social actors involved in these struggles; third, defining the major articulations of this educational role in terms of empowerment. The article concludes by demonstrating the strategic role of empowerment, when promoted by education, in the struggles against the recession of subjective or citizenship rights. Las luchas por el reconocimiento, centradas hasta hace poco en aspectos culturales e identitarios, vuelven al dominio público en forma de luchas por el reconocimiento legal, precisamente cuando estamos asistiendo, en el contexto de la recesión económica posterior a 2008, a una revisión a la baja de los derechos de ciudadanía, particularmente de los derechos sociales y laborales. Este artículo aborda este problema: primero, asociando la educación con las luchas por el reconocimiento legal, en base a la «gramática moral de los conflictos sociales» de Axel Honneth; segundo, mostrando cómo la educación, conectada con el empoderamiento, puede desempeñar un interesante papel en la cualificación de los actores sociales involucrados en estas luchas y, en tercer lugar, definiendo las principales expresiones de este papel de la educación en términos de empoderamiento. El artículo concluye demostrando el estratégico papel del empoderamiento, cuando es potenciado por la educación, en las luchas contra la recesión de los derechos subjetivos o de ciudadanía.<br>

Abstract: The paper explores the meaning of conversion for African Christians in South Africa by looking at some of the indigenous terms that have populated the Christian vocabulary. The paper focuses on terms like
         ukuguquka, ukukholwa, ibandla, ikholwa, igqobhoka, inkonzo,andinkolo. These terms are found among people who speak Nguni languages. It shows how they were used in pre-Christian context and traces their evolution in Christian contexts. Research conducted in the Reformed Presbyterian Church, St John’s Apostolic Faith Mission, and Methodist Churches in Cape Town between 1997 and 2001 has indicated that conversion was not a simple religious process but involved diverse political, economic and social aspects. Conversion involved a transformation of an African Christian identity from the margins to the centre. It also involved extensive negotiation of what it means to be Christian through the translation of Christian content into an African idiom. The paper goes through various terms and how their original meanings were discarded for new ones.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses human resources management (HRM) systems and practices in a large multinational management consultancy firm. The firm invests considerable resources in HRM, and is frequently praised by employees for its accomplishments in hiring, developing, and promotion. However, this general faith in HRM does not align particularly well with employees' experiences and perceptions of the specific HRM practices in the firm. The paper critically interprets the meaning and the functions of the HRM system and the beliefs supporting it. The paper suggests a reinterpretation of HRM systems and practices based on a cultural-symbolic perspective. It introduces the concepts of excess ceremonialism, identity projects, and aspirational control to highlight and interpret the significance of organizational symbolism in accounting for the role of HRM systems and practices, and the various effects of HRM systems and practices on employee identity and compliance.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: Cet article aborde un aspect du processus d'interprétation de la vie religieuse ou cloîtrée amorcé au sein des communautés religieuses catholiques romaines dans les années '70. On avance que, durant cette période de transition, on a fait l'expérience d'un rejet massif du concept de "cloître" en tant que clôture au sens physique, en soulignant le fait qu'il y avait là plus qu'une simple modification de la pratique communautaire, axé sur une réalité transcendante de caractère utopique qu'on aurait voulu orientée en direction d'une expérience communautaire de caractère profane. En fait, ce type de rejet apparaît comme une transformation du concept de "cloître," ne niant point le fait de la continuité au niveau de l'identité communautaire. Les religieuses catholiques romaines ont eu recours à deux images de pointe: la fiancée éternelle du Christ et le clown, ou bouffon, du monde profane. /// This paper examines one aspect of the interpretive process undertaken by religious communities of North American Roman Catholic sisters in the 1970s, or the redefinition of cloister. It is suggested that during this transitional period, widespread rejection of the concept of cloister as physical enclosure was more than a mere illustrative shift away from a communal paradigm stressing utopian transcendence, and toward a communal paradigm identified as profane. In fact, this rejection signaled a transformation in the concept of cloister that allowed for continuity in communal themes of identity across contrasting paradigms. To effect this transformation, Roman Catholic sisters contrasted two liminal images: the transcendent Bride of Christ, and the profane clown.<br>

Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Abstract: This article reflects on the question of the disappearance of the individual subject of experience in Beckett's writing, and its gradual replacement by an anonymous subject. After The Unnamable, the voice becomes increasingly ambiguous or plural. It can no longer be ascribed to any distinct individual. In the light of Paul Ricœur's analysis of narrative identity, I intend to show how Beckett's work gradually goes, through the notion of alterity, beyond the problematic of subjectivity. By suspending the question who, the Beckettian text appears to be more and more organized by a missing presence, and moves toward a gradual reinforcement of the notion of past.<br>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates how, in a southern Irish setting, differences based on the historic struggles between Protestantism and Catholicism are perpetuated and communicated. It outlines the background and identifies modes of speech indicating unexamined assumptions grounded in the collective memory of the past. It analyses the ways in which the irruption into everyday communication of this emotional legacy reproduce difference, and examines Protestant perceptions that Catholics see them as incapable of possessing an authentic national identity. It shows how the process results in Protestant exclusion from the imagined nation and the category of 'Irishness'.<br>

Abstract: Much recent commentary on the theory of international politics has focused on the analysis of change and the continuing vitality of political realism. This paper argues that the philosophical dilemmas posed by the concern with change and by the claim to political realism are intimately related. The argument is pursued in the context of contrasting traditions of political realism, of the antithesis between structuralism and historicism in contemporary social and political theory, and of recent tendencies and controversies in the literature on neorealist theories of international politics. The paper concludes that political realism ought to be understood less as a coherent theoretical position in its own right than as the site of a great many interesting claims and metaphysical disputes. As there is no single tradition of political realism, but rather a knot of historically constituted tensions and contradictions, these tensions and contradictions might be reconstituted in a more critical and creative manner. This involves an examination of the way the core categories of international political theory depend upon a particular formulation of the relationship between identity and difference-a formulation which must be refused.<br>

Abstract: Insufficiently radical environmentalism is inadequate to the problems that confront us; but overly radical environmentalism risks alienating people with whom, in a democracy, we must find common cause. Building on Paul Ricoeur's work, which shows how group identity is constituted by the tension between ideology and utopia, this essay asks just how radical effective environmentalism should be. Two "case studies" of environmental agenda—that of Michael Schellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, and that of David Brower—serve to frame the important issues of cooperation and confrontation. The essay concludes that environmentalism must lead with its utopian aspirations rather than its willingness to compromise.<br>

Abstract: The recollections of elderly men of work in a time of full employment are the focus of this paper. It is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with men who were young parents in the mid-1950s. Drawing on literature about masculinity, post-war Fordism and the constitution of self-identity through narrative, it explores their themes of how central security was to their identity as providers, and examines what satisfactions they got from working. The narrative bookends of their experience are strong memories of their parents in the Depression, and acute awareness of the contemporary insecurity of their children and grandchildren.<br>

Abstract: El surgimiento de una identidad aymara entre la población indígena del norte grande de Chile es un fenómeno reciente, como lo han demostrado algunos investigadores en los últimos años. En este artículo se aborda el vínculo problemático que se establece entre indentidad y memoria como parte de este fenómeno nuevo en el que los sujetos involucrados, principalmente aymaras urbanos, sienten la necesidad de articular una memoria representativa de ese colectivo amplio que es el pueblo aymara, planteándose, al mismo tiempo, el desafío de construirla, o como sus promotores sostienen, de "conocerla" y "descubrirla". El análisis tiene como punto de partida las tensiones que cruzan este proyecto y cómo éstas se reflejan en los documentos producidos por distintas organizaciones aymaras a partir de los años noventa. Nuestro interés se concentra en aquello que los sujetos dicen acerca de la memoria aymara (nivel de metamemoria), los esfuerzos desplegados en su construcción y los recursos utilizados en este intento. The emergence of an Aymara identity among the indigenous population in the northern part of Chile is a recent phenomenon, as some researchers have shown in the last few years. This paper discusses the difficult link between identity and memory as a part of a new phenomenon, where the concerned individuals, mainly urban Aymara, feel the necessity of articulating a memory that would represent this broad collective group, the Aymara people. At the same time, they assume the challenge to build this memory, or, in their own words, to "know" and "discover" it. The analysis focuses on the tensions that exist in this effort and on the way in which these tensions appear in the writings of different ethnic organizations since the nineties. Our interest centers on what the subjects say about Aymara memory (the level of metamemory), as well as on the efforts they put on its construction, and the resources they use.<br>

Abstract: Riprendo, ampliando i conte-
sti di riferimento, la complessa
nozione demartiniana di mun-
dus (De Martino 1977:11-282)
che comprende il mondo inte-
riore, come vissuto psicopatolo-
gico e di alienazione, e il mondo
esterno spazio-temporale e sim-
bolico per analizzare il rapporto
discorso-mondo. Mi allontano
dalla nozione di Searle (2001,
trad. it. 2003: 117-137) in cui la
direzione d' aggiustamento ri-
guarda un mondo come real-
tà supposta data. Mi accosto,
invece, a Vernant (1997: 49) il
cui approccio pragmatico con-
duce non solo a moltiplicare i
mondi - mondo esterno comu-
ne, mondo interno del locuto-
re, differenti mondi costituenti
ciascuno il risultato di un pro-
cesso specifico d'interazione e
di transazione-, ma anche ad
individuare senso e finalità dei
discorsi e potenza interazionale
e transazionale dei soggetti.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Oral traditions can contain elements of historical evidence and convey meaning. The narrative pattern of oral epics serves not merely as "a mnemonic device" that aids in recalling significant historical events but makes meaningful connections to the cultural experience of identity politics. On Cheju Island, a volcanic island located some fifty miles below the southernmost tip of the Korean peninsula, the indigenous sense of identity and history is expressed and accentuated in the fate of the shrine deities who are portrayed as exiles in shamanic epics such as ponhyang ponp'uri. The tragic heroism in the cliché of exile and return of the shrine deities recapitulates the historical identity of Cheju people as "exiles at the frontier." After Cheju Island lost political autonomy as an independent kingdom, Tam-ra, in the early twelfth century, the Cheju people's cultural memory of isolation and redemptive desire for liberation from the mainland state's domination becomes intelligible and justifiable textually through the heroic acts of exiled deities.<br>

Abstract: Over the past few years, the relationship between landscape and the body as two physical entities mutually informed through performance has been increasingly interrogated by cultural geographers. Similar issues about memory, embodiment and performativity have been raised in the social sciences, yet often obliterating the material specificities of place and landscape. This paper reconsiders the relationship between landscape and memory in terms of embodied, visual and spatial practice, rather than as a contested cultural politics of heritage and identity (as it has been generally understood in cultural geography after the so-called 'cultural turn'). Drawing on Nora's 'memory places' and on the Deleuzian notion of 'ontological past', as well as on recent writing on historical geographies of exploration and travel, the paper explores the spatial re-activation of Classical historical memory by nineteenth-century British officers and travellers to Aegean mountain peaks through their embodied and site-located practices of climbing, surveying or simply 'gazing'.<br>

Abstract: In order to give an account of the Congolese tragedy since independence, the inhabitants of Haut-Katanga often resort to four different narratives: the abandonment by Belgium; the biblical curse on Africans; the conspiracy of Western capitalism; or the alienation of life powers by Whites. Though these four stories offer different scenarios, they are all constructed with two types of actors - Whites and Congolese people. This article suggests that this racial/national frame finds its origins in colonial and national ideologies, which have left their mark on Haut-Katanga, and that it continues today to structure the narratives through which people remember their post-colonial history. Collective memory and racial/national identity are reciprocally constituted in these stories, but in different terms. They offer, accordingly, different ways of influencing the present.<br>

Abstract: This essay argues that literary theory can no longer afford to adopt an exceptionalist view of its own disciplinary identity and relation to the Western tradition. To this end, it outlines a conceptual framework that distinguishes between competing tendencies within the Western tradition represented by the terms metaphysics and ontology. The implications of this distinction for literary theory are that the most important sources of the latter's disciplinary identity are neither the linguistics-based movement of French structuralism, as the term poststructuralism implies, nor a "modernity" that has been superseded, as the term postmodernism implies, but rather a modernist tradition of aesthetics shaped by eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century German romanticism and idealism.<br>

Abstract: Current scholarship has jettisoned much of Albright's view of early "Israel" as a collective entity with a distinctive ethnic identity. Nonetheless, the author argues that the "Albrightian approach" of a synthetic overview of cultural developments has not been exhausted. But how can we achieve such in today's intellectual climate? Schloen critiques Albright's holistic and idealist cultural typology as well as the models presented by radical postmodernism and the so-called "human ecosystem paradigm." Instead he argues that the answer is to be found in a methodologically individualist model à la Max Weber.<br>

Abstract: The recent turbulent events in the Middle East indicate the importance and the challenges of uniting citizens in each of these countries in some commonly known story of who they are and from whence they have come. A consciously constructed sense of collective history is one especially fertile ground from which stories of national identity can be drawn. This article interprets a set of symbols displayed in a political drama in one particular Turkish small town. Following Ricoeur's analyses of ideology, it shows how sentiments of national identity are created and maintained in seemingly small ways. The symbols and processes which affirm identity, however, concomitantly disguise and distort other expressions of the historic situation. Although distortions may be the result of benign processes of signification, they may also be manipulated to favor the needs and desires of persons and groups which seek to maintain power and influence.<br>

Abstract: This article examines some of the discursive practices through which residents of West Virginia coal-mining communities negotiate the emically defined role of "neighbor." Notions of personhood privilege the synaptic, the contextual, and the relational. The ontology informing these discursive practices is contextualized within the historical conditions of their lives as working-class. Data and analysis contest essentialized notions of 'Appalachia', working-class consciousness, and social 'identity'.<br>

Abstract: Despite the abundance of psychological studies on trauma related ills of descendants of historical trauma, and the extensive scholarly work describing the memory politics of silenced traumatic pasts, there has yet to emerge a critical analysis of the constitutive practices of descendants of historical trauma. This article presents an ethnographic account of a support group for descendants of Holocaust survivors, proposing that the discursive frame of intergenerational transmission of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and support group based narrative practices allow descendants to fashion their sense of self as survivors of the distant traumatic past. The discursive frame of transmitted PTSD acts as both a mnemonic bridge to the past and a mechanism of identity making, as participants narratively reemplot their life stories as having been personally constituted by the distant past. A close ethnographic reading of on-site discursive practices points to how culture ferments to produce narratives, practices and ultimately carriers of memory to both sustain and revitalize historical grand narratives and the cultural scenarios they embed.<br>

Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Abstract: The literary epic Lāčplēsis, written in the nineteenth century, was a conscious attempt to create a cultural frame of reference for the emerging Latvian nation. In this article, which examines how poet Andrejs Pumpurs imagined his community, Kruks compares the Latvian epic hero with his Estonian counterpart, Kalevipoeg, who was invented at the same time under similar conditions of domination by Russians and Baltic Germans. Kruks's narrative analysis demonstrates the different frameworks through which social bonds are constructed for the heroes. Kalevipoeg is a pragmatic actor with an explicitly formulated duty; he errs, but he recognizes his personal responsibility. The Latvian hero Lāčplēsis, on the other hand, is not given a clearly formulated duty; he is simply a hero by destiny and definition. As a resource of symbols that feed contemporary discourses, the epic impedes the construction of a modern national identity capable of engendering a civic society through active pragmatic participation. For past generations, Lāčplēsis explained unjust foreign domination. Kruks argues that contemporary Latvian society now seeks a new frame of cultural reference that will permit the construction of a future-oriented national identity.<br>

Abstract: Popular music plays important roles in two related films portraying Brazilian slum life. Based on a 1953 play by Vinícius de Morais, Marcel Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro, and a 1999 feature by Brazilian director Carlos Diegues titled Orfeu, augment traditional samba styles with bossa nova and rap, respectively. Interpreting musical style as allegorical texts within fictive landscapes, this paper examines conflation and conflict among musical meanings, Brazilian social histories, and discursive identities marking the twentieth century. Broad aspects of Brazilian political and socio-cultural development are implicated, such as authoritarianism, the politics and sociology of race, technological advances, mass media, and modes of modernisation. Here, bossa nova and rap engage society through reflexive and generative interpretations within a narrative designed to illustrate connections between processes of innovative, trans-national cultural production, myths of national identity, social change, and the powerful role of popular music in film.<br>

Abstract: Views of the self may be plotted on a set of coordinates. On the axis that runs from fragmentation to unity, Rorty and Rorty's Freud champion the decentered self while Wallwork, Taylor, and Ricoeur argue for a sovereign, unified self. On the other axis, which runs from the disengaged, inward-turning self to the engaged and "sedimented" self, Wallwork, would be positioned near Rorty, defending self-creation against the narrative identity affirmed by Taylor and Ricoeur. Despite his skepticism concerning the communitarian agenda of the narrativists, Flanagan grants that the self is social and relational--a position further explored by Oliver, Stendahl, Deutsch, and Mack in "Selves, People, and Persons".<br>

Abstract: Among the Sui people of rural southwestern China, descent- group loyalties are closely tied to linguistic features. In every village, long-term dialect contact occurs between local villagers and in-marrying women from different clans, yet most speakers maintain their original dialect features to a high degree. The present study conducts ethnographic interviews to more deeply understand why such behavior occurs. Most current, practice-based models of identity tend to emphasize dynamic, flexible, individualistic choices-an approach that suits variation on many levels in many societies. However, to understand the descent-group loyalties particular to indigenous, non-Western, clan-based cultures like Sui, a more tempered, culturally sensitive model is necessary. Speakers show a deep sense of stability, permanence, and collective loyalty to communities of descent, (re) produced through stable linguistic expressions: acts of loyalty. The study also highlights the use of indigenous minorities' own categories (place, toponyms, lineage) rather than non- indigenous categories.<br>

Abstract: This study scrutinizes consumption of modern design as a strategy of distinction in Turkey. Conceptualizing taste as an acquired and dynamic medium through which inhabitants build and sustain social relationships, the article examines domestic furnishings as tools for constructing a Western socio-cultural difference from the late nineteenth century through to the 1950s and 1960s. Furthermore, it looks at the structures acting on furniture design and consumer choices. The study explicates the view that architects and decorators promoted a taste reform towards different versions of European Modernism throughout the 1930s and in the mid-twentieth century. The modern emerged as a distinctive element not just between different classes but also within upper-class consumers themselves. The luxurious hotel projects, particularly the pivotal Istanbul Hilton Hotel, were instrumental in spreading the codes of furniture and for shaping contemporary practices, when the influx of US culture had an all-pervading impact, in the post Second World War context. A shift in the dominant taste towards modern designs, the use of synthetic materials, such as Formica, and the advent of new design elements, such as the American bar, revealed a concern for taking part in a new modern identity that reflected cultural competence in the way the West was (re)interpreted.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: We presented a model which describes the field of questions on identity as a field of dynamics. It is structured by means of particular, temporal configurations of identity through time and space. The theory of dynamic systems provides us with precise models for the representation of forms of identity, or of their evolution towards types of so-called chaos, given certain conditions. The model allows us to work in a comparative perspective, which is a sure advantage in conflict analysis. The complexity of identity phenomena is captured covering individual, group and community dynamics of identity.<br>

Abstract: En este texto, el autor intenta esclarecer determinados aspectos del imaginario en relación con el Estado, la política, pero también en relación con la violencia y el mal, en un contexto en el que la dialéctica de la identidad y de la alteridad sigue siendo una de las estructuras del imaginario. El imaginario, más allá del ámbito exclusivo de las representaciones, actúa sobre el mundo y sobre la evolución de la historia. Pero el mundo también actúa sobre el imaginario y son los períodos de crisis los que amplían sus manifestaciones, destinadas a "a servir de pantalla contra los temores". En este sentido, la violencia, frente a la cual cabe adoptar actitudes diferentes, se convierte en un elemento simbólico para interpretar nuestras fuerzas. ¿Hasta qué punto estamos presenciando un nuevo modo de funcionamiento de los imaginarios políticos y religiosos? Para responder a esta pregunta, el autor habla de esperanza intercultural "en un mundo donde las voluntades de poder de lo trágico interfieren en los impulsos de lo comunicacional". In this text, the author attempts to clarify certain aspects of imaginarles in relation to the State and politics, but also in relation to violence and evil, in a context in which the dialectic of identity and otherness continues to be one of the structures of imaginarles. Imaginarles, beyond the exclusive sphere of representations, act on the world and on the evolution of history. But, the world also acts on imaginarles, and it is the periods of crisis that enlarge their manifestations, destined to "serve as a screen against fears." In this sense, violence, in the face of which different attitudes can be adopted, becomes a symbolic element for interpreting our strengths. To what extent are we witnessing a new way of functioning of political and religious imaginarles? To answer this question, the author discusses intercultural hope "in a world in which the will of the power of the tragic interferes with communicational impulses."<br>

L'imaginaire, débordant le champ exclusif des représentations, agit sur le monde et sur le mouvement de l'histoire. Mais le monde agit aussi sur l'imaginaire et ce sont les périodes de crise qui amplifient ses manifestations, appelées à "faire écran contre les peurs". C'est dans ce sens que la violence, face à laquelle différentes attitudes sont possibles, devient un élément symbolique pour interpréter nos forces. Jusqu'à quel point est-on en train d'assister à un nouveau mode de fonctionnement des imaginaires politiques et religieux ? Pour répondre à cette question l'auteur parle d'espérance interculturelle "dans un monde où les volontés de puissance du tragique brouillent les élans du communicationnel".

Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Abstract: While concepts of a postinternational politics properly highlight the constant variance of entities in play in international relations, the approach lacks an ontology that shows how such an unstable variety of types of players can coexist in a common field in the first place. This article draws upon Deleuze's philosophy to set out an ontology in which the continual reformulation of entities in play in "postinternational" society can be grasped.This entails a strategic shift from speaking about the "borders" between sovereign states to referring instead to the "margins" between a plethora of entities that are ever open to modifications of identity. The concept of the margin possesses a much wider reach than borders, and focuses continual attention on the meetings and interactions between a range of indeterminate entities whose interactions may determine both themselves and the types of entity that are in play.<br>

Abstract: En étudiant les récits de vie des paysans roumains du Banat et d'Olténie déportés dans les années cinquante dans la plaine de Bǎrǎgan, nous avons essayé de mettre en évidence de quelle façon le récit de vie peut être un révélateur d'une réalité ethno-historique et anthropologique. Nous avons souligné le problème d'ordre méthodologique qu'une telle étude pose au chercheur. Dans un premier temps, nous avons discuté le statut discursif du récit de vie comme discours de témoignage, et les conséquences qui en dérivent pour son analyse comme texte narratif et argumentatif qui développe une rhétorique spécifique. Une description du contexte historique auquel font référence les textes, ainsi que des circonstances dans lesquelles l'enquête orale a été menée, nous a semblé nécessaire pour dégager l'importance du thème de l'identité et de la différence dans les récits de nos interlocuteurs. En analysant ce thème, nous avons tenu compte des constellations idéologiques et symboliques qui dominent ces développements dans le texte des critères que les paysans utilisent pour se différencier de l'Autre sous ses différents visages. L'analyse de ces facteurs suggère des pistes intéressantes pour déceler certaines mentalités et pratiques culturelles, surtout celles liées au foyer et à la famille et aux pratiques culinaires. Studiind povesteǎ vieţii a 70 de ţǎrani deporţati între anii 1951-1956 în Bǎrǎgan am pus în evidenţǎ problemele de ordin metodologic şi teoretic cu care se confruntǎ cercetǎorul dornic sǎ reconstituie o realitate istoricǎ, etnograficǎ şi antropologicǎ pornind de la mǎrturiile celor ce povestesc evenimentul deportǎrii. Purtînd mǎrcile subiecti viaţii naratorului şi a unei ideologii personale aceste texte sunt în acelaşţi timp naraţiuni şi o formǎ de a depune mǎrturie. Ele dezvoltǎ deci o retoricǎ specialǎ prin care faptul trǎit se transformǎ în fapt povestit şi se comunicǎ unui interlocutor. Analia acestei retorici necesitǎ cunoaşterea discursurilor prin care evenimentul ne parvine, a condiţiilor în care s-a desfǎşurat ancheta, compararea povestirilor între ele pentru a constata apropierile diferenþele şi mai ales diferitele tipuri de focalizǎri. Acestea din urmǎ ne permit sa sesizǎm ce e mai important pentru cel ce povesteşte şi de ce. Pentru a ilustra aceasta problematicǎ ne-am oprit la tema identitǎţii şi alţeritǎţii, încercînd sǎ urmǎrim constelatiile idéologice şi culturale sub semnul cǎrora stau expansiunile ei in texte, criteriile prin care Celǎlalt este identificat şi prezentat. Through the study of the life stories told by the Romanian peasants of Banat and Oltenie, who were deported during the 1950s to the plain of Baragan, this article attempts to show how such biographical accounts can serve to reveal an ethno-historical and anthropological reality.We begin by underlining the methodological problems that such studies pose for the researcher. We discuss the discursive status of these accounts as a discourse intended to bear witness and the implications of this status for an analysis as a narrative and argumentative text, generating its own specific rhetoric. Along with an account of how this oral enquiry was carried out, it also seemed necessary to give a description of the historical context to which these accounts refer, in order to draw attention to the theme of identity and difference in the accounts given. The analysis of this theme required that due attention be paid do the ideological and symbolic constellations that surround it, in the criteria that the peasants use to differentiate the Other, in his or her multifarious guises. The examination of these factors offers several interesting lines of enquiry on cultural practices and mentalities, and on those in particular which relate to the household, the family and culinary habits. Indem wir die Lebensgeschichten der rumänischen Bauern aus Banat und Oltenie studierten, die in den fünfziger Jahren in die Ebene von Baragan vertrieben wurden, versuchten wir, herauszustellen, wie die Lebensgeschichte eine volksgeschichtliche und anthropologische Wirklichkeit ans Licht stellen kann. Wir haben das methodologische Problem betont, die sich für den Forscher aus derartigen Studie ergibt. Zuerst haben wir den erzählerischen Status der Lebenserzählung als Zeugnisrede erörtert, sowohl als auch die Folgen, die sich daraus ergeben, wenn sie als erzählender und argumentierender Text analysiert werden soll, der eine spezifische Rhetorik entwickelt. Eine Schilderung des historischen Zusammenhangs, worauf sich die Texte beziehen, und der Umstände, unter denen die mündliche Befragung sich abspielte, kam uns als notwendig vor, um die Bedeutung des Themas der Identität und des Unterschieds in den Erzählungen unserer Gesprächspartner hervorzuheben. In der Analyse dieses Themas nahmen wir die ideologischen und symbolischen Konstellationen in Kauf, die in den Textstellen vorherrschend sind, wo die Kriterien dargelegt werden, die die Bauern benutzen, um sich von dem Anderen unter seinen verschiedenen Gesichten zu unterscheiden. Die Analyse dieser Faktoren legt uns interessante Forschungswege nahe, die es erlauben, manche Denkweisen und kulturelle Verhaltensweisen herauszuheben, und zwar insbesondere diejenigen, die mit dem Heim -, Familienleben und Kochsitten verbunden sind.<br>

Abstract: Le Tessin représente l'unique canton de la Suisse à grande majorité italophone. La construction de l'identité se base essentiellement sur la notion d'« italianité » et sur celle de « helvétidté ». Il s'agit en réalité d'une « double appartenance », et l'article analyse les différents modes de production sociale de l'ambivalence au plan des discours (historiques, linguistiques, folkloriques, politiques, rituels et visuels) et des pratiques sociales correspondantes. The canton Ticino is the unique Swiss canton with Italian-speaking majority. The construction of identity is based essentially on che notions of « italianity » and « swissness » which reveal in fact a « multiple belonging » to Italy and Switzerland. The article analyzes social production of ambivalence in historical, linguistic, folkloric, political, ritual and visual discourses and the corresponding social practices. Der Kanton Tessin ist der einzige Kanton mit italienisch-sprenchender Mehrheit. Die Konstruktion der nationalen Identität beruht hauptsächlich auf den Begriffen von « italianità » und « patria svizzera », was eine multiple italienische und schweizerische Angehörigkeit andeutet. Der Artikel analysiert die verschiedenen Modi von Sozialer Produktion von Ambivalenz in historischen, linguistischen politischen, ritualen und visualen Diskursen und der entsprechenden sozialen Praktiken.<br>

Abstract: Cet article examine le concept de la performativité du don dans une communauté côtière ethniquement diversifiée, composée majoritairement d'autochtones sames et de Norvégiens. Inspirée par Mauss puis par Ricœur, l'auteure avance l'idée que la pratique du don revêt une importance capitale dans ces territoires isolés et peut être vue comme facteur d'émergence d'un sentiment de communauté et d'identité. Le don devient un acte performatif de relations et d'ethnicité, et une manière d'aborder la situation postcoloniale dans la région. This article addresses the performativity of the gift in an ethnically mixed coastal community, the population being predominantly indigenous Saami and Norwegian. Taking inspiration from Mauss and later Ricœur, my argument is that giving is highly important in these remote areas and can be seen as a way of creating community as well as identity. The gift becomes an act of performing relations as well as ethnicity and a way of approaching the postcolonial situation in the region. Das Konzept der Performativität des Gebens innerhalb einer ethnisch gemischten Gemeinschaft (Norweger und Samen) an der Küste Norwegens steht im Mittelpunkt dieses Artikels. Inspiriert durch die Theorien von Mauss und Ricœur verfolgt der Autor die Idee, dass das Geben eine wichtige Funktion in isolierten Gemeinschaften übernimmt und zum Aufkommen eines Gefühls von Gemeinschaft und Identität beiträgt. Das Geben wird zu einem performativen Akt unter den Ethnien und zu einer Mittel mit der postkolonialen Situation der Region umzugehen. Artikkelen adresserer gavens performativitet i etniske sammensatte kystsamfunn bestående av samisk og norsk befolkning. Inspirert av Mauss og Ricœur blir det argumentert for at å gi gaver ; er viktig i disse samfunnene og kan ses som konstituerende i forhold til både fellesskap og identitet. Gavebytte er handlinger som relasjoner gjøres gjennom og adresserer etnisk ambivalens, i tillegg til à være tilnærmingsmåter til den postkoloniale situasjon i region.<br>

Abstract: Pour perpétuer des éléments fondateurs de la culture, les communautés des diasporas utilisent leur espace privé comme territoire privilégié de la conservation et de l'expression d'une identité exilée. L'exemple des Arméniens du Québec est, à cet égard, particuliérement révélateur tant dans la composition de sa culture matérielle et immatérielle que dans les pratiques qui la mettent en scène par l'entremise de petits musées domestiques. À partir d'un recueil de récits de vie et de biographies d'objets, l'article propose d'établir le portrait de ces structures muséales et de leurs collections à l'échelle familiale pour ensuite saisir leur oeuvre dans le projet de transmission culturelle. Living in a Diaspora commands an increased vigilance for the perpetuation of the founding elements of a culture. In this perspective, in a host country, the private sphere and its heritage constitute a privileged space for the preservation and expression of the exiled identity. This can be seen in domestic museums, such as those of Quebec's Armenian community, where the composition of material and immaterial culture and the presentation of its contents are particularly revealing. From a collection of life narratives and object biographies, this article proposes to draw a portrait of these family-scale museum structures and their collections to understand how they function in the project of cultural transmission. Um elementare Bestandteile ihrer Kultur zu erhalten, nutzen kulturelle Gemeinschaften in der Diaspora gerne den privaten Raum als Statte des Ausdrucks ihrer Exilidentität. Die Gemeinschaft der in Quebec lebenden Armenier ist hierfür ein sehr gutes Beispiel, sowohl was ihre materielle und immaterielle Kultur angeht als auch im Hinblick auf die Art und Weise wie sie ihre Kultur in kleinen hauslichen Museen inszenieren. An Hand von menschlichen wie auch gegenständlichen Biographien porträtiert die Autorin in diesem Artikel die musealen Strukturen und Familiensammlungen, um das entstandene Werk so in den Prozess der kulturellen Überlieferung einzubetten.<br>

Abstract: Dédié à l'étude du rôle de l'intelligentsia roumaine dans la mise en œuvre des politiques mémorielles, cet article met en évidence trois fonctions de la mémoire : l'accréditation mémorielle de la reproduction démocratique des élites culturelles du communisme, la mise en cause historique de la mémoire d'une résistance intellectuelle anticommuniste et finalement le rôle de la mémoire du communisme dans la rhétorique identitaire de divers groupes de l'intelligentsia. Studying the responsibility of Romanian intelligentsia in the implementation of memorial politics, this article examines three complementary questions : memorial accreditation of democratic conversion of communist intelligentsia, historical contestation of intellectual resistance against communist regime, and eventually, the role of communist memory in the intelligentsia's contemporary rhetoric of identity. Drei Aufgaben der Erinnerung hebt dieser Artikel, der sich der Rolle der rumänischen Intelligenzija bei der Umsetzung einer Erinnerungspolitik widmet, hervor : die dauerhafte Festschreibung der demokratischen Reproduktion der kulturellen Eliten des Kommunismus ; das Infragestellen der Erinnerung der Intellektuellen im antikommunistischen Widerstand und letztlich die kommunistische Erinnerung, in ihrer sich selbst beschreibenden Rhetorik verschiedener Gruppen der rumänischen Intelligenzija.<br>

Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Abstract: Le rapport qu'entretiennent histoire et mémoire à l'école est complexe et ambigu. Jusqu'aux années quatrevingt-dix, il a surtout été posé comme la relation, légitimée ou dénoncée, entre savoirs historiques, histoire scolaire et mémoire nationale. Dès les années soixante, le débat prend en compte le rapport entre le récit national et des histoires régionalistes qui revendiquent une place dans la culture scolaire, au nom des identités et du droit au passé. Cette dernière acception prévaut largement à l'heure actuelle mais cette fois au nom des minorités dépossédées de leur histoire, dès lors qu'elle n'a pas d'expression publique. Dans ces débats, la mémoire serait la forme d'une histoire parallèle, occultée et clandestine ; de leur côté les historiens tendent à distinguer histoire et mémoire. L'histoire scolaire, elle, admet l'histoire mais non les mémoires comme savoir de référence légitime ; pourtant les commémorations et le « devoir de mémoire » s'y invitent de plus en plus fréquemment. De telles évolutions interrogent les composantes de la discipline scolaire : au premier chef les finalités et les contenus mais aussi les pratiques, inégalement connues dans ce domaine et, finalement, les apprentissages souvent plus espérés qu'avérés. The connection that exists at school between history and memory is complicated and ambiguous; it is source of debate and demands which recently intensified with public and political uses. School history accepts history but not memories as good legitimate reference. And yet commemoration ceremonies and the "duty to remember" are more and more in the schools. Such changes question the elements of that school subject: its purpose of building identity and citizenship, its contents and their changes, its teaching practices, not really evenly known in this field, and finally the learning that is more often wished for than actually delivered. La relación que mantienen historia y memoria en la Escuela es compleja y ambigua; alimenta debates y reivindicaciones que recientemente han sido avivados por los usos públicos y políticos de la historia y de la memoria. La historia escolar admite la historia pero no las memorias como saber de referencia legítimo; sin embargo las conmemoraciones y el "deber de memoria" se invitan cada vez más frecuentemente. Tales evoluciones interrogan los componentes de la asignatura escolar: las finalidades identitarias y cívicas, los contenidos y sus renovaciones, las prácticas, desigualmente conocidas en este campo, y finalmente los aprendizajes a menudo más esperados que comprobados. Das Verhältnis zwischen Geschichte und Gedächtnis in der Schule ist komplex und mehrdeutig. Es gibt den Anlass zu Debatten und Forderungen, die die öffentlichen und politischen Anwendungen des Gedächtnisses und der Geschichte neulich haben aufleben Tassen. Die Schulgeschichte duldet die Geschichte aber nicht die Erinnerungen als Maßstab gebendes Wissen, während Gedenkfeier und "Erinnerungsgebot'' (Aufarbeitung der Vergangenheit) immer öfter daran teilhaben. Eine solche Entwicklung stellt die Komponenten des Schulfachs Geschichte in Frage: über seine Zwecke, was die Identitätsfrage und den Bürgersinn betrifft, über den Inhalt und seine Veränderungen, über Praktiken, die in diesem Gebiet oft ungenügend bekannt sind, und schließlich über das tatsächliche Erlernen, das oft eher erhofft als erwiesen ist.<br>

Abstract: Cet article (1) présente une réflexion théorique sur la notion de genre, de ses définitions et ses usages en sciences sociales. S'opposant à l'approche dominante qui conçoit le genre comme identité ou attribut socialement construits des personnes, conception qu'elle considère comme essentialisante ou substantialisante, l'auteur argumente en faveur d'une approche relationnelle du genre conçu comme modalité des relations sociales. Elle se fonde pour cela sur des travaux d'anthropologie comparative et historique qui contraignent à reconsidérer le dualisme du moi et du corps constitutif de l'idéologie individualiste de la personne, et critique I'hypostase du Moi comme homoncule constitué à partir d'une absolutisation de la première personne. Analysant le système sexué des trois personnes grammaticales, elle soutient que, n'étant pas référentiel, « le je de l'interlocution n'a ni sexe, ni genre ». Les apports croisés de l'anthropologie et de la philosophie analytique la conduisent à revoir la notion de personne pour mieux penser la capacité proprement humaine de se reconnaître comme d'un sexe sans être jamais assigné à celui-ci. This article presents a theoretical work on the idea of gender, its definitions and uses in social science. The author objects to the mainstream approach that sees gender as an identity or an attribute that some people socially construct. She sees that idea as essentializing or substantializing. She argues in favor of a relational approach of gender conceived as mode of social interactions. Her approach is based on comparative and historical works of anthropologists that lead to consider the dualism of the ego and the body which make the individualistic ideology of a persona, and she criticizes the hypostasis of the ego as homunculus made up from absolutizing the id. Analyzing the gender system of the three grammatical persons, she asserts that, as it is not a reference, the other person's "I" does not have a sex nor a gender. The contributions from both anthropology and analytic philosophy lead her to reconsider the notion of persona so as to better grasp the capacity—specifically human—to see ourselves belonging to a sex group without having ever been assigned to it. Este artículo presenta una reflexión teórica respecto a la noción de género, de sus definiciones y sus usos en ciencias sociales. Oponiéndose al enfoque dominante que concibe el género como identidad o atributo socialmente construidos de las personas, concepción que considera como esencializante y sustancializante, la autora argumenta a favor de un enfoque relacional del género concebido como modalidad de las relaciones sociales. Para ella, se basa en los trabajos de antropología comparativa e histórica que obligan a reconsiderar el dualismo del yo y del cuerpo constitutivo de la ideología individualista de la persona, y critica la hipóstasis del Yo como homúnculo constituido a partir de una absolutización de la primera persona. Al analizar el sistema sexuado de las tres personas gramaticales, sostiene que al no ser referencial, "el yo de la interlocución no tiene ni sexo, ni género". Los aportes convergentes de la antropología y de la filosofía analítica lo llevan a reconsiderar la noción de persona para pensar mejor la capacidad propiamente humana de reconocerse como de un sexo sin nunca ser asignado a él. Dieser Artikel bietet theoretische Uberlegungen über den Begriff Gender, seine Definitionen und seinen Gebrauch in den Sozialwissenschaften. Die Autorin setzt sich gegen die meist verbreitete Auffassung des Genders als sozial aufgebaute Identität oder Attribut des Einzelnen, denn sie betrachtet sie als eine essentialisierende bzw. substantialisierende Definition. Dagegen argumentiert sie für eine beziehungsmäßige Herangehensweise an das Gender, die es als eine Modalität der sozialen Beziehungen erfasst. Sie bezieht sich dabei auf vergleichenden und historischen Anthropologiearbeiten, die uns dazu zwingen, das Dualismus des Ichs und des Körpers zu überdenken, der einen Bestandteil der individualistischen Ideologie des Menschen darstellt, und kritisiert dazu die Hypostase des Ichs als Einzelnen, der auf Grund einer Absolutisierung der ersten Person geschaffen wird. Indem sie das geschlechtliche System der drei grammatikalischen Personen analysiert, behauptet die Autorin, dass auf Grund seiner Unbezüglichkeit „das Ich in der Interlokution weder Geschlecht noch Gender hat". Die Beiträge der Anthropologie und der analytischen Philosophie führen zu einer Überdenkung des Begriffs Mensch, um die rein menschliche Fähigkeit besser zu erfassen, die darin besteht, dass man sich einem Geschlecht anschließt, ohne dass es einem je zugewiesen wird.<br>

Abstract: This article argues for a synthesis of George Herbert Mead's conception of the temporal and intersubjective nature of the self with Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory of narrative identity. Combining the insights of Ricoeur's philosophical analysis with Mead's social-psychological orientation provides a subtle, sophisticated, and potent explanation of self-identity. A narrative conception of identity implies that subjectivity is neither a philosophical illusion nor an impermeable substance. Rather, a narrative identity provides a subjective sense of self-continuity as it symbolically integrates the events of lived experience in the plot of the story a person tells about his or her life. The utility of this conception of identity is illustrated through a rereading of Erving Goffman's study of the experience of mental patients. This example underlines the social sources of the self-concept and the role of power and politics in the construction of narrative identities.<br>

Abstract: The article begins with an analysis of the concept of identity and a description of two theoretical traditions which lie at the source of this concept and which determine the operationalisations of the identity concept within the context of social change (G.H. Mead and E. Erikson). The author then goes on to discuss the problems which evolve from the many applications of the concept of identity to analysis of collectives. The concept of collective identity is outlined and four basic ways of understanding this concept in contemporary sociology are discussed. The author refers in his presentation to the works of F. Barth, R. Turner, A. Touraine, S. N. Eisenstadt, E. Gellner, and A. Kłoskowska. The author concludes his article with several comments focusing on the relationships between social change and collective identity and he refers to those approaches which either stress the relative independence of identity formulae and social structure or even view the evolving patterns of identity as a factor contributing to social change.<br>

Abstract: The article asserts that a search for truth ought to be carrying out in such a way as to preserve or enhance solidarity. It demonstrates the necessity and the difficulties of making atrocious and traumatic historical events legally accountable. The necessity and difficulties have been recently fuelled by the trends towards the openness of modern identity and the growing importance of human rights, both of them demanding settling conflicts in the context of the multiplication of particularistic memories, yet without undermining social solidarity constructed on liberal foundations. The article argue that because of the hybrid nature of the task, unresolved tensions between memory and history, the erosion of the state's ability to impose unitary and unifying framework of memory, there is no simple and quick solution to tensions between memory, solidarity, and therefore to manage these strains we need to rely a plurality of contending narratives and civility of rules.<br>

Abstract: Even though the European Union has become an "ever closer union" in economic and political terms, the problem of the emotional deficit of the EU identity calls for solutions. Metaphor offers an untypical yet interesting mechanism of overcoming the alien aura of the EU. Taking into consideration the cognitive value of metaphors, Antony Judge, the EU expert, designed the dynamic system of metaphors to articulate the new European identity. At the same time, in the candidate countries the alternative discourses of European identity emerge. Polish press makes use of the emotional potential of metaphors. With the help of metaphors Polish pubic discourse grounds the claim of the rightful and necessary belonging of Poland to the European Union thus engaging in symbolic politics. Moreover, through metaphoric images the relations between Europe and the "Self" are critically or ironically assessed. In an ambiguous period of accession negotiations these metaphors empowered Polish public to create their own conceptions of what the European identity is.<br>

Abstract: In a variety of ways, all ethnographies are politically cast and policy relevant. Each of three recurrent political rhetorics is related to a unique set of fieldwork practices. Ethnographies that report holistically on journeys to "the other side" build policy/political significance by contesting popular stereotypes. Theoretical ethnographies draw on political imagination to fill in for a lack of variation in participant observation data and to model an area of social life without attempting to rule out alternative explanations. Comparative analytic studies build political relevance by revealing social forces that are hidden by local cultures. Each of these three genres of ethnographic methodology faces unique challenges in relating fieldwork data to politically significant explanations. By shaping the ethnographers relations to subjects and readers, each methodology also structures a distinctive class identity for the researchers-as worker, as aristocrat, or as bourgeois professional.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks to outline and evaluate Pierre Bourdieu's work as it has appeared most recently in feminist studies and the field of gender and education. In particular, it suggests ways in which Bourdieu's theoretical insights could be seen to more effectively contribute to cutting edge debates in both social theory and feminist thought regarding concepts such as agency, identity and domination. It also argues that a more creative and empirical engagement with the recent work of Bourdieu, alongside an interdisciplinary reading of more recent cultural and social theories of power, would be a fruitful way forward in advancing a feminist sociology of education. In the present historical moment and against the tide of postmodern and post-structuralist feminist accounts, Bourdieu is often read as a determinist who has little to offer contemporary feminist debates or who argues that masculine domination is too tightly woven to social practices of a given field. In short, this paper argues that such a view is not only a misreading of Bourdieu's work on fundamental theoretical grounds, but fails to acknowledge the ways in which his more recent work on masculinity addresses both the cultural and social conditions underlying contemporary forms of symbolic domination. In short, the paper argues that Bourdieu's theory offers an analytical breadth and range beyond the scope of anything that a normative, liberal account of masculine domination could provide. Yet, in drawing from such diversity, Bourdieu's oeuvre is able to resist incomprehensibility. It stands as a highly focused, realistic and generative attempt (McNay, 1999; McLeod, 2004) to chart the problems of subordination, differentiation and hierarchy, and to expose the possibilities, as well as the limits, of gendered self-hood.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I uncover the routine, ongoing practices that sustain institutional multiplicity. Drawing on a comparative study of the two high-tech conferences held in Israel in 2002,1 examine how diverse institutions are discursively handled in field-configuring events. Institutional multiplicity was expressed at this site through two identity discourses, one that situated the industry within a national context and another that oriented it toward the global markets. In addition, the conferences were constructed around different best-practice discourses that focused on guidelines for either investment or management. These four discourses reflected and further affected power relations between the field's actors, and they were differentially distributed across separate social spaces between the conferences and within them. The contribution of this study to our understanding of institutional multiplicity lies in demonstrating how it is maintained in practice, politically negotiated between actors, and refracted across separate social spaces.<br>

Abstract: This article seeks to address how Lebanese youth are dealing with the legacy of civil war (1975-90), given the national backdrop of official silence, persisting injustice, and competing memory discourses. Drawing on Marianne Hirsch's concept of postmemory, it explores the memory of a generation of Lebanese who have grown up dominated not by traumatic events but by narrative accounts of events that preceded their birth. This residual form of memory carries and connects with the pain of others, suffusing temporal frames and liminal positions. The article examines how postmemory is mediated and transformed through the mnemonic lenses of visual landscapes and oral narratives. Consideration is given to the dynamic production of "memoryscapes"—memories of violence localized in particular sites—and to narrative constructions of the past implicated in the ongoing search for meaning, historical truth, and identity. This article seeks to challenge pervasive notions of Lebanese postwar amnesia and of a generational detachment from the residual effects and future implications of war recollections.<br>

Abstract: This paper critiques the rise of scientific approaches to central questions in the humanities, specifically questions about human nature, ethics, identity, and experience. In particular, I look at how an increasing number of philosophers are turning to evolutionary psychology and neuroscience as sources of answers to philosophical problems. This approach constitutes what I term a biological turn in the humanities. I argue that the biological turn, especially its reliance on evolutionary psychology, is best understood as an epistemology of ignorance that contributes to a climate of hostility and intolerance regarding feminist insights about gender, identity, and the body.<br>

Abstract: Françoise de Graffigny's mid-eighteenth-century play Phaza features a main character who is unknowingly crossed dressed as male. The text provides a rich starting point for exploring questions of gender identity and performance. This article situates Phaza within the fairy-tale tradition in which women authors played a major role. Its analysis draws upon philosophies of narrative identity and theories of gender to show that identity comprises both permanence and performance. Reading Graffigny can make an important difference in our understanding of gender, authorship, and relations between the sexes in Enlightenment France. Phaza's masquerade sheds light on the ways in which women authors of the era approached and assumed various gender identities. Eighteenth-century texts like Phaza reveal a lineage of ideas that continue to influence feminist thought today and will do so in the future.<br>

Abstract: This article addresses the woman teller's identity in the literary fairy tales of France. The author rereads prefaces and images that scholars have used to demonstrate the woman teller's literarity to argue rather for her "frivolity," a word the women themselves use to describe their writing. The essay finds that frivolity is an aesthetic principle at the heart of the women's poetic project that marks their difference from even the Modern partisans of the great literary debate. The principle of frivolity is captured in an image that recurs in prefaces by the writers: the "modern" fairy.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Author(s): Waistell Jeff<br>
Abstract: This study investigates how business leaders dynamically narrate their aspirational ethical leadership identities. In doing so, it furthers understanding of ethical leadership as a process situated in time and place. The analysis focuses on the discursive strategies used to narrate identity and ethics by ethnic Chinese business leaders in Indonesia after their conversion to Pentecostal-charismatic Christianity. By exploring the use of metaphor, our study shows how these business leaders discursively deconstruct their 'old' identities and construct their 'new' aspirational identities as ethical leaders. This leads to the following contributions. First, we show that ethical leadership is constructed in identity talk as the business leaders actively narrate aspirational identities. Second, the identity narratives of the business leaders suggest that ethical leadership is a context-bound and situated claim vis-à-vis unethical practice. Third, we propose a conceptual template, identifying processes of realisation and inspiration followed by significant shifts in understanding, for the study of aspirational ethical leadership.<br>

Abstract: In the quest for a more sustainable environment, there appears to be a need to confront issues of tradition vs. modernity and culture vs. technology in a world where boundaries once dividing these issues are collapsing, and differences once separating them are disappearing. This study demonstrates, through examination of a series of built examples, the successful integration of tradition and modernity as they are reflected in Muslim cultures. In practice, the notion of culture and technology is addressed through the built context, ultimately establishing the identity of a society through its architecture. This paper argues for the preservation of a culture through understanding the level of symbolism established in its built environment: the higher the level of symbolism, the further detached an artifact becomes from its place of origin. This research focuses on possible scenarios involving the conscious application of past and present typologies of form and technology in search of a recognizable cultural identity.<br>

Abstract: This article challenges the assumption that "tradition" is a quality pertaining chiefly to objects, stylistic conventions, or the use of materials. Equally, it refutes the notion that tradition is merely the perpetuation of ritualized practices or skilled techniques. By considering the complex relation between vocational migration, heritage, and identity among contemporary fine woodworkers at London's Building Crafts College, it argues that tradition is a state of mind — a recurring nostalgia for an idealized past, or the desire for a Utopian future. More specifically, the article investigates a "tradition of longing" for engagement in nonalienating modes of production, aesthetic work, and an authentic way of living.<br>

Abstract: As violence escalates among black males in many sectors of American life, thinkers are forced to seek solutions to this problem from a variety of perspectives. Inspired largely by a 1994 black fraternity hazing death, this article examines violence as a societal construct, not one intrinsic to individuals. The paradigmatic possibilities this approach brings to bear include: (1) the establishment of an unseverable link between race and class when studying marginalization, (2) the societal politicalization of black males in their struggle for identity, and (3) a societal approach to questions of freedom, identity, and violence where the black male is concerned.<br>

A Matrix of Contemporary Christian Voices is employed to array differences among Baptists in their expression of denominational identity and to discover limits as to what it means to think like a Baptist.<br>

Abstract: An increasing number of individuals worldwide are receiving home nursing care from loved ones. Many healthcare professionals are exploring the use of narrative to help family caregivers meet the personal demands of this work. Citing Ricoeur's notion of narrative identity as a social process in which cultural norms and values are negotiated between speaker and audience, this paper argues that health care professionals can assist their clients by viewing narrative as collaboration, not autonomous construction. Collaboration in construction of narrative identity was observed in interactions between family caregivers and public health workers on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. There, caregivers were supported by a dialogic process in which interlocutors explored the cultural values that define and delimit the possibilities for living as caregivers.<br>

Abstract: Improvements in treatments for childhood cancers have led to an "epidemic" of survival. Yet we have limited understanding about the overall ramifications of survival and quality of extended life for this growing population of young people. In this paper I consider lived experiences of longterm survival following cancer in childhood from a social science perspective. I explore young people's negotiations of narrative identity and associated processes of coming to terms with their own subjective position as young adult survivors. Discussion is based on qualitative data collected from 57 young adults in 2000. I focus on three concepts that help to discern ways in which cancer becomes enmeshed in personal identity — the Delta factor, narrative dissonance and narrative repair.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le Sakuteiki (Notes sur l'arrangement des jardins, XIe siècle) jusqu'aux jardins de daïmyôs de l'époque d'Edo (1603-1867), le jardin japonais est empreint d'une tendance marquée à référer les formes de ses constituants à des sites et à des paysages modèles dénommés « sites de renom » (meisho). Ce système de référence est appelé mitate, ce qui signifie littéralement « instituer par le regard ». Cela se rapporte, d'une part, au principe de la métaphore, et, d'autre part, au dynamisme fondamental des localisations dans l'écoumène, tel que l'illustrent le couple topos/chôra dans le Timée et la distinction que fait Nishida entre logique d'identité du sujet et logique d'identité du prédicat. Fron the Sakuteiki (Notes on the making of gardens, XIth c.) to daimyos gardens of the Edo period (1603-1867), the Japanese gardens display a prominent tendency to refer its material forms to paradigmatic places and landscapes, called « places with a name » (meisho). This system of reference was called mitate, which literaly means « instituting by seeing ». It is here related, on the one hand, to the principle of metaphor, and on the other hand to the fundamental dynamics of place in the ecumene, as illustrated by the couple topos/chôra in the Timaios and by Nishida's dictinstion between a logic of the identity of the subject and a logic of the identity of the predicate (or logic of place).<br>

Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Abstract: In July 2004, a young woman claimed that she had been attacked on the Paris urban railway system by four Maghrebins and two Africans and that the discovery that she might be Jewish had intensified the character of the attack. For a number of days, the French media were dominated by the case and leading politicians condemned it. The events drew attention to a number of issues concerning culture and identity in contemporary France and the role played in constituting this identity of history and memory. However, it also displayed how the constitution of identity is a selective process in which different elements may be dealt with, either in different ways or omitted altogether. This article explores how in attempting to come to terms with the legacies of anti-Semitism, other areas of history and memory have been neglected, including the legacy of France's colonial empire, and, in particular, her relationship with Algeria.<br>

Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: The concept of the nation as an imagined community has gained importance in the relevant literature during the last decade. How do we construct national identities in discourse? Which topics, which discursive strategies and which linguistic devices are employed to construct national sameness and uniqueness on the one hand, and differences to other national collectives on the other hand? These questions were investigated in our study on the Austrian nation and identity. Taking several current social scientific approaches as our point of departure, we have developed a method of description and analysis of these phenomena which has applications beyond the discursive production of national identity in the specific Austrian example studied. By focusing particularly on the discursive construction of (national) sameness, this study has broken new ground in discourse-historical analysis, which until now has mainly been concerned with the analysis of the discursive construction of difference.<br>

Abstract: In this article, a young man's narratives of violence are analysed, and a culturally shared storyline is identified as the basis of these narratives. It is argued that the stories are organized so as to construct a preferred self-presentation. One strategy to achieve this is to establish boundaries for what type of violence to use, whom to fight, where and for what reasons. I also argue that the narratives are structured to avoid being categorized as either victim or perpetrator, although both categories are drawn upon. Issues of masculinity are made relevant through categorization of the characters in the narrative, and positions are made available. Different masculine categories such as the hero/villain/non-man become relevant in the analysis. Different gendered positions are used in negotiating a masculine identity around narratives of and through telling about violence.<br>

Abstract: L'article qui suit envisage quelques unes des questions que soulève aujourd'hui la notion d'identité aussi bien individuelle que collective dans le politique. En prenant appui notamment sur les réflexions d'Ernst Tugendhat dans Conscience de soi et autodétermination, je suggère que les préoccupations identitaires et les interrogations autour d'une crise de l'identité gagnent à être abordées à partir de la notion de projection et de détermination de la volonté et des actions plutôt qu'en termes de traits définitionnels statiques. Je suggère aussi que l'étude doit prendre en compte non seulement la situation dans ses dimensions individuelles et collectives mais aussi les conditions de désorientation que produit désormais l'incertitude concernant l'idée de l'humain elle-même. In this paper I consider some of the issues raised by the notion of identity in the political area to-day. Drawing upon the reflections of Ernst Tugendhat in his book Selbstbewusstsein und Selbstbestimmung, I suggest that contemporary problems of identity, individual and collective as well, and namely the idea of a postmodern crisis of political identities, are better understood when we view them in terms of projects and determination of actions. I also suggest we have to take into account not only individual and collective aspects of identity but also our inability to define our idea of what it is to be human.<br>

Abstract: Since the early 1990s, the concept of historical consciousness has been central to didactic research in Sweden. It has mostly been used as a theoretical framework on a macro-level or as an attempt to identify students' historical consciousness. This article applies the theoretical concept of historical consciousness to tangible source material:history textbooks from the twentieth century. It focuses on whether Swedish history textbooks for lower secondary school have articulated contexts that may be conducive to developing historical consciousness. The article employs a number of theoretical concepts—narratives, multichronology, identity, and values—in order to analyze perspectives that can be utilized to trigger historical consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The role of nonhumans in social life has recently generated significant scholarly interest. The two main paradigms for explaining the sociological significance of nonhumans are constructivism and actor-network theory. We propose a pragmatist synthesis inspired by George Herbert Mead, demonstrating how interactions with nonhumans help constitute the social self—that is, the identity one constructs by imaginatively looking upon oneself as others would. Drawing upon observations of humans interacting with objects, animals, and nature, we identify two complementary ways that nonhumans organize the social self and enable people to experience group membership in absentia: (1) by molding how one is perceived by others and constraining alternative presentations of self and (2) by acting as a totem that conjures up awareness of, and feelings of attachment to, a particular social group. This formulation moves beyond constructivist claims that nonhumans reflect people's self-definitions, and it offers a corrective to actor-network theory's neglect of sociality.<br>

Abstract: In Britain, as in France, 'mainstream' anthropologists were hesitant to acknowledge studies within their own country as proper subjects for anthropological enquiry. British social anthropology defined itself as the study of 'other cultures' and became entrenched in a tradition in which Otherness was confused with manifest difference. This naivete, elevated into a scientific principle, precluded the recognition of 'self as anything other than a scientific instrument; but also led to the invention of a generalisable Other, and thereby ignored the complexity of variation within the cultures it studied. By the same token, it blinded anthropologists to heterogeneity within their 'own' local cultures as well, and was finally changed only by a series of related paradigm leaps. Our understanding of culture changed from a set of prescriptive influences which integrated society, to a ragged and non-systemic array of interpretive tools which aggregated society. Consequent upon this change, symbols were acknowledged as vehicles of expression and of negotiable meaning rather than as having stipulated and invariant referents. The demise of modernist theories liberated anthropology from its scientific illusions and positivistic pretensions, enabling it to acknowledge the personal and speculative nature of the enterprise. This admission of the subjective, of the anthropologist's self, was necessary in order to see Otherness as inhering in 'person' rather than in an abstraction such as 'culture' and, therefore, to be enabled to recognise diversity within cultures rather than merely between them. This enhanced perception of internal heterogeneity clearly places the Self of the anthropologist at the centre of the stage and has led to the contemporary debates about the nature of ethnographic writing and the status of ethnographic 'authority'. It has also had obvious consequences for anthropological research, including the raising anew of the relationship of individual to society; and the extension of anthropological research into the urban and industrial heartlands of the ' developed' world. These substantive consequences have established incontrovertibly the appropriateness and potency of anthropology in the study of such societies; and have also provided a basis from which to inform the core debates and central concepts of the discipline. These developments are evident in recent studies of kinship, social identity and symbolism. The reflexivity which is an essential ingredient of research on these topics (until recently noted with more eloquence and alacrity in France than in Britain) calls attention to the inevitable, and desirable, intrusion of the Self into anthropological research. It also demands the explicit incorporation of the complex Self-Other opposition in the fomulation of anthropological 'problems' — not as a baring of the post-modernist soul, but as an interpretive resource. An important illustration of the power of this resource may be found in the study of ethnic and local identities which are thereby revealed to be a matter of internal discourse (among Selves, so to speak) as well as of relativistic counter-definition. It is in precisely this way that research in anthropologists' 'parochial' or local milieux will contribute to the maturation of anthropology generally.<br>

Abstract: The article examines the phenomenon of communist/post-socialist nostalgia, with a focus on Slovenia and Poland, through the central issue of identity, memory and the concrete manifestations of nostalgia. The emergence of a somewhat distinct 'Eastern European' identity and the East--West divide in historical and cultural terms is explored throught several historical events of the European project between the World Wars. The revival of the communist brands, commercial products, symbols, music and film is the core of the communist 'renaissance', witnessing mainly the need for encountering the past, the selevtiveness of memory and the right and emotional need to value one's own personal history and past.<br>

Abstract: This paper contrasts intersectionality, the negative definition of identities, and multiple identities, the situational valorisation of positive identities, to argue for a generational shift in the performance of everyday multiculturalism in Britain. In everyday encounters, actors work to sustain the definition of the situation (Goffman) and with it a surface of civility and mutual respect which are nevertheless morally compelling. Everyday relationships flow smoothly and naturally, in an unreflexive, taken-for-granted way, to constitute shared positive identities (Schutz). Such surface civility may, however, be disrupted by communicative breakdowns whenever participants do not share implicit systems of relevancy. Deconstructive analyses that probe beneath the surface of the everyday can also reveal the existence of negative identities, subject to discrimination and stigmatisation. This paper contrasts the experience of first-generation Commonwealth immigrants to Britain with that of successive generations, who unreflexively displayed a shared British identity during the London 2012 Olympics.<br>

Abstract: An interest in narrative has done much to shed light on our understandings of geography. Studies linking narrative to nation building, the making of place, identity, the region, the spaces of health, heritage, and environmental history, give some indication of the breadth at which geographical scholarship has been pushed forward by an applied interest in stories. This article attempts to develop such work with a particular focus on the performative capacities of narrative; how stories might work towards various recuperative outcomes. It discusses the revision of historic tours around Angel Island Immigration Station, a California State Park property and National Historic Landmark with reference to the term narrative economy. The Immigration Station plays host to a narrative economy where stories circulating around the site acquire value on the basis of their factual content and their compatibility with a set of approved messages. Some of these stories are disputed and devalued so as to distinguish them from factual 'histories' produced by recently commissioned research. The article considers how heritage sites negotiate tensions between the burden of representational accuracy and the need to function more broadly as platforms for liberatory intervention.<br>

Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: This article elucidates the personalized, life-centered funeral by analyzing the development of specialized funeral functionaries and their construction of celebratory post-mortem rituals in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on participant observation and ethnographic interviews, this essay argues that secular celebrants accentuate the significance of individuality and narrative identity, but also link components of the life-centered funeral to memorialization and mourner identity. Celebrants emphasized a need to re-discover ritual in contemporary society and grounded this rediscovery in a late-modern context that not only amalgamated authenticity, intuition, and emotional empression, but incorporated central elements of Pakeha (non-Maori) New Zealand indentity.<br>

Abstract: Concepts of place, narrative, tradition, and identity are employed in a conservative reading of the Texas A&M Bonfire. Texas A&M embodied regional narratives of a dual Southern commitment to economic and technological development and conservation of traditional cultural. Institutionalized at Texas A&M in the late nineteenth century, these narratives made a paradoxical place. Bonfire expressed and obscured this paradox. In line with the narrative of tradition, Texas A&M was an all-male military school until 1965. The students were uniform, isolated, and regimented. This social structure engendered intense feelings of loyalty and community. These social emotions were further aroused at events like yell practice, and projected onto Bonfire. After the Second World War the commitment of university administrators to economic and technological progress increasingly threatened the narrative of tradition and the cultivation of manliness. Student veneration of Bonfire intensified. After 1965 mandatory military drill was discontinued, women were enrolled, and the student body was enlarged. Social pluralism fragmented the meaning of Bonfire; conflict and disorderly behavior ensued. By the 1990s the university had partly rationalized Bonfire as a corporate symbol; however, this trend was tragically terminated in 1999 when the cumulative errors of the oral tradition caused Bonfire to collapse, killing twelve students.<br>

Abstract: Literary historians have persistently regarded The Education of Henry Adams as a "paradigmatic" text. While "historical explanations" stress the book's historical achievement, "critical explications" portray it as a failure of historical consciousness that achieves its success in the ahistorical arenas of aesthetic integration and imaginative projection. To relate the products of "explication" with the aims of "historical explanation," I regard the work's true "paradigm achievement" as an inquiry into "historical being." For Adams this achievement embodies disciplinary formulation and professional commitment and thus coordinates historical speculation and self-cultivation. One must assess the ethical density and cultural significance of the text before explaining its historical identity. The Education, despite its origin in epistemological chaos, makes the past eternally relevant to the present; for it is a personal and theoretical discovery of how the narrative structures of history and selfhood create the possibilities of individual and social life.<br>

Abstract: The conflict between formalist thinking and theories that view texts in their historical contexts serves as a starting point for the introduction of a cognitive view of literature. From this perspective language has full referential powers. The "referent" splits into two entities, however: things-in-themselves (in their material identity), which we cannot know, and things in their coded form, which are perceptually accessible. Readers' mnemonic potentials, a consequence of the bonding of perception and language, are adduced to show that texts originate in past interpretations of other texts and in personal experience and that consequently social forces and historical events are subsumed in the individual memory. In the cognitive light, memory becomes the ultimate metaphor, and the epistemological claim of realism regains its compelling force.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The question of human rights in modern literary theory is closely connected to its concept of the "subject"; the paper outlines Barthes' concept of the centrality of the human subject and Derrida's concept of différance and its impact on his understanding of the concept of the subject. With Derrida's différance, which means both difference and deferral, it became impossible to talk about the concept of the "subject" in isolation from that of the "other," whether one is dealing with the national aspects of the subject or with its gender issues. The deconstruction of the concept of the "subject" brings into the fore the omitted, marginalised and neglected aspects pertinent to its composition and accentuates both the processes of difference and deferral inherent in it. The representation of the subject implies its difference from, and indeed suppression of, the other. It also shows how Derrida's concept of différance dealt a devastating blow to the various philosophical absolutes and social hierarchies which controlled our thinking. The paper then examines the implications of these new critical and philosophical concepts for two different "others": the similar other within the culture (women) and the different other, the stranger/outsider to the dominant Western culture. It demonstrates how modern literary theory helped women to liberate themselves from cultural oppression by deconstructing patriarchal binary thinking and its inherent bias against women and so consolidate their human rights. It limits itself in this domain to a discussion of the contribution of French feminist literary theory, particularly the work of Hélèn Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. Their work shows how the literary, philosophical and critical canon perpetuated patriarchy and oppressed women. As for the different other, the paper refers to the work of Edward Said in his deconstruction of Orientalism and its discourse which subjects the other to the demands, needs and visions of the Western "self" and sacrifices in the process his identity and human rights. It also studies the work of the African American critic Henry Louis Gates and shows how his attempt to develop a literary theory based on, and deriving its conceptual framework from, the literature of African and Afro-American writers played a significant role in liberating the African American, undermining their biased representation in the culture, and upholding their human rights.<br>

Abstract: Although extensive research has been directed toward ethnic identity over the past 15 years, the issue of local identity has been relatively neglected. This article examines local foci of identity in rural Brittany. Studies of regional ethnic groups in Europe have frequently emphasized the external boundaries dividing such groups from dominant national cultures. In contrast, the present article suggests that internal, local boundaries are emically of greater significance in the construction of cultural identities.<br>

Abstract: Shikhat are female performers in Moroccan society whose singing and dancing are central to all festivity, including rites of passage like marriage ceremonies and birth and circumcision celebrations. Despite their centrality, however, shikhat are socially marginal due to the license that they exhibit both in performance and in their "off-stage" lives. This article examines the artistic and bodily competencies of the shikhat as they articulate some of the more powerful metaphors of Moroccan identity, extending ultimately from embodiments of shame to embodiments of the one heterogeneous nation.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Abstract: This article investigates identity in two autobiographies and two life-history interviews from North Africa. The autobiographies show the centrality of "key" self-representational symbols which the authors selectively draw from their cultural lexicon but invest with idiosyncratic affective meanings. The life narratives show how the "structured ambiguity" of self-symbols allows them to be reconfigured to articulate contrasting identities, among which the narrators shift. Generative models of musical cognition describe crucial features of this multiplicity. Against both modernist and postmodernist views of culture and self, narrative data argue for a distributed model of culture and for a theory of multiple identities integrated by "key" cultural symbols.<br>

Abstract: A detailed narrative performed by a Gros Ventre elder is analyzed for its significance in the construction of cultural identity. In the context of these analyses, it is argued that narrative performance can be central to the active construction of cultural identity for individuals engaged in social interaction. In the present instance, certain performative features of the narrative involve a discursive identification by the narrator with the narrative protagonist that affords a personal resolution of a cultural crisis-in-meaning. Finally, this discursive identification by the narrator results in the re-creation of narrative events that involve the audience as participants in ways that powerfully impact the cultural identities they too will construct.<br>

Abstract: Examination of cultural and social factors surrounding zar spirit possession diagnoses in Northern Sudan suggests that a major issue addressed by the cult is the cultural overdetermination of women's selfhood. Circumcision and infibulation operate to establish in women a sense of self congruent with the cultural image of woman as reproducer. When experiences and expectations fail to mesh, some women fall ill and are ultimately diagnosed as possessed. Through acceptance of the possession diagnosis and participation in curing rites involving trance, a patient is given scope to expand and regenerate her sense of self and recontextualize her experiences.

Abstract: Sumbanese descriptions of the "traditional house" as a microcosm and emblem of local identity are neither unproblematic expressions of a cultural totality nor simply objectifications imposed by ethnography or modernity. One way the house is able to serve as a discursive object reflects, in part, specifically Sumbanese models of action and beliefs about language as refracted in changing historical circumstances. In ritual, speakers seek to engage and elicit responses from powerful others, whereas current religious and political developments reframe ritual words as means of describing a cultural world. Both sets of practices draw on the authority of "entextualized" language but interpret it in different ways. Emerging representations of cultural meaning are shaped by long-standing speech genres and by recent social and cultural transformations, mediated by shifting language ideologies.

Abstract: Using a form of narrative analysis, I explore how marriage in contemporary China influences people's identity formation as "men with disabilities." In particular, I examine how local practices of marriage exclusion shape the definition, marginalization, and experience of men who have trouble walking. This discussion is more phenomenological than most previous accounts of men's experiences of marriage in Chinese Society. [marriage, disability, identity, body, manhood, narrative, China]<br>

Abstract: Peirce's general theory of signs, or semiotic, as he called it, yields a theory of the self that sees it both as the object and the subject of semiotic systems. From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology<br>

Abstract: Si la visibilité des personnes LGBTQ dans la sphère publique, notamment dans les établissements d'enseignement, est certainement libératrice pour bien des élèves, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'on se demande si la représentation des identités LGBTQ dans les médias populaires sert à libérer les élèves ou si elles ne favorisent pas plutôt des stratégies subtiles de contrôle et de ghettoïsation. Le présent article soutient qu'en tant que stratégie d'éducation sexuelle, l'essentialisation de l'identité sexuelle dans le cadre de l'éducation sexuelle devrait être supplantée par des approches plus constructivistes laissant place à un maximum d'individualisation et d'expression de soi. Plutôt d'adopter certaines étiquettes et la marchandisation qui parfois en dérive dans les médias populaires, les éducateurs sensibles à l'allosexualité pourraient penser à certaines méthodes associées à la pédagogie spirituelle afin d'aider leurs élèves à repenser les questions relatives à la sexualité et à créer de nouvelles possibilités en matière d'identité et d'expression de soi.<br>

Abstract: Historical narratives help construct social identities, which are maintained through differentiation between in-groups and “others.” In this article, we contend that Fatima Besnaci-Lancou's texts, as well as her reconciliation work—in which she enjoins Beurs and Harkis' offspring to write a new, inclusive, polyphonic narrative of the Algerian War—are an example of the positive use of textually mediated identity (re)construction. Her work suggests the possibility of implementing a moderate politics of empathetic recognition of the (often migration-related) memories of “others” so as to reinforce French national belongingness.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores the
         sugyain the Babylonian Talmud that includes the story of the Oven of Akhnai, in BTBaba metzi‘‘a58b––59b, expanding earlier studies by Jeffrey Rubenstein and Charlotte Fonrobert. It shows that two scriptural quotations involving, respectively, David and Tamar, situated in the first part of thesugya, anticipate the subsequent story and clarify how it functions as a ““foundation myth”” of the Beit Midrash (Fonrobert), and, therefore, of male identity (Boyarin). I suggest that the entiresugyaconstructs male identity by way of contrast with two ““others,”” the divine and the female realms, which are excluded from the Law-making process. The danger of verbal wrong, however, reveals the necessity of reintroducing the excluded ““others.”” The text achieves this by recognizing the existence of a transcendent justice, and by making Tamar, a foreign and female character with no access to the Law, a model of delicacy in verbal communication.<br>

Abstract: A book proposing an overview of “African literature” is a very attractive proposition to the new reader seeking orientation in a vast and fastgrowing vibrant field, to the expert in one area looking to explore others, and perhaps also to the publisher with a canny eye to the bottom line. This essay examines the often bewildering array of apparent subcategories that emerge in some key texts published around the turn of the twentieth-first century that purport to offer an overview of African literature in French, but which seem to entirely set aside important international debates over “postcolonial,” diaspora, and hybridity, among others. These texts have an important role in the construction of knowledge of “African literature,” but their strengths and limitations become clear when we look closely at the categories suggested and no more so than when the category happens to be that of “identity.”<br>

They are the machinery that crushes the material of tradition, like the teeth of a tropical sugarmill, transforming stalks and husks into bagasse and juicy syrup.

Abstract: Even in her familial tone, and perhaps because of it, Jabbeh Wesley never forgets that the healing and meaning-making function of grief and mourning, as painful as grief and mourning are, is not to be avoided. Rather, as DuBose argues, based on the painful experience of his wife's miscarriage, as “‘child’ and ‘parent’ disappeared, our bodies and our society
      dys-appeared, and our connections and hopes re-appeared” (374). Jabbeh Wesley attaches the reappearance of the hopes for the healing and reconstruction of her Liberian world to people's ability and willingness to truly experience the painful process of grief and, perhaps informed by that cathartic experience, allow compassion and empathy to guide their relationship to others.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: I want to conclude with one more argument from my own work. I have very often argued that philosophers of technology, regarding the expectations of society and their own traditions and habits, may come “too late” to technologies. They too often undertake their reflections
            afterthe technologies are in place. Rather, I argue, they should reposition themselves at what I call the “R&D” position where technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly “new” and emerging technologies be fully philosophically engaged.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Mauriceis a novel that waits for the future (for completion, publication, and audience) but also looks nostagically to the past. This strange temporal location reflects a temporality basic to Forster's narrative structures and sexual identity: like philosophers who presently ascribe to the “tenseless theory of time,” Forster dispels identity among a tenseless order of moments, in a narrative structure that seeks likewise to trade “becoming” for a better order. InMaurice, such tactics as iterative seriality, overdetermined prolepsis, nonephiphany, and other modes of “detensing” give form to a version of homosexuality that would escape “identity,” with unusual implications for moderist temporality and narratological criticism. Forster's modernist time is eccentric for its interest in logical order; and the narratological criticism which would attend to his “tenseless” homosexual form must remember that it is often the combination of subversion and order that encourages the best narratological advances.<br>

               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: Liudmila Ulitskaia’s 2006 novel, Daniel’ Shtain, pervodchik (Daniel Stein, Translator), explores the experience of the Russian-speaking diaspora in the aftermath of World War II through a focus on Jewish immigrants in Israel who convert to Christianity. The novel’s treatment of the divisive topic of Jewish to Christian conversion is enabled by the author’s reliance on the theoretical and allegorical values of translation. Evoking advancements in twentieth-century translation studies through its broad treatment of translation and critique of the investment in the notion of fidelity to the original, be it language or identity, the novel advocates for the acceptance of the transformations and the resulting hybridity of the Jewish diasporic self. Daniel Stein, Translator specifically highlights the influence of the Soviet nationalities policies and the Nazi occupation of eastern Europe on the identity metamorphoses of Soviet Jews. By promoting the legitimacy of the expressions of Jewish identity by immigrants from the USSR through her novel, Ulitskaia proposes an expanded and anti-essentialist view of Jewish identity that would include individuals traditionally viewed as apostates.<br>

Abstract: Familial
         memoryis indispensable to individual memory. By recounting memories, the individual gains greater control over them, integrating them within self-identity. These functions are undermined by theRepublicanfamily's fear of reprisals for articulating a counter-discourse in theFrancoist New State, and the personal history of Sunta, the narrator inAlfons Cervera's
               
                  , is bereft of supportive socio-cultural frameworks. Sunta resolves this situation through the medium of narrative memory, which effects a retrospective uncovering of memory traces through images of the past, allowing her to revisit an inadequately assimilated childhood from an empowered position.El color del crepúsculo<br>
