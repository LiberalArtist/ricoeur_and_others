  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: It is not often that, in the daily inundation of concise and carefully selected wordings accompanying images, jointly aiming at bringing the attention of the current-time ever-distracted and ever-rushing viewer to focus on some important plight or another, a verbal-image combination—an Internet meme—strikes me so powerfully as to remain with me for years, possibly forever. This was the case, however, with the photograph of a calf, removed from the mother far too young and placed in a barren crate with barely enough room to move. The calf is looking directly into the camera with pleadingly confused eyes. The<br>

  Abstract: The surprising popularity of psychoanalysis has made the fortunes of certain key-words: image, symbol and symbolism have now become current coin. At the same time, systematic research devoted to the mechanisms of “primitive mentality” has revealed the importance of symbolism in archaic thinking and also the fundamental part it plays in the life of any and every primitive society. The obsolescence of “scientism” in philosophy, the revival of interest in religion since the first world war, many poetic developments and, above all, the researches of<br>

  Abstract: When studying the Grateful Dead—both the band and the wider cultural phenomenon—one should not be surprised if the image discovered is mixed or even contradictory: Was the Grateful Dead a rock band at all? If not, what was it? Jerry Garcia early on could claim that the band was not for ʺcranking out rock and rollʺ but ʺto get high.ʺ¹ Bob Weir stated that ʺweʹre a jazz band. I wonʹt say weʹre nothing but a jazz band, because our basic premise is rock ʹnʹ roll. We just approach it from a jazz point of view.ʺ² Phil Lesh talked<br>

  Abstract: Many readers have been inclined to pass quickly over Canto XVIII, thinking its philosophical discussion of love and free will to be of little importance and finding no particularly significant character or event. To such readers, the philosophical discussion may appear repetitive of Marco Lombardo’s statements on free will and the soul in Canto XVI; moreover, there is nothing in Canto XVIII to match Marco’s engaging image of the

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Abstract: What is it to be embodied quite literally “in the flesh,” to live not only the remarkable elasticity of our skin, its colors and textures, but also its fragility, its responsive and visible marking of our accumulated experiences and our years in scars and sags and wrinkles? How does it feel and what does it look like to age and grow old in our youth-oriented and image-conscious culture—particularly if one is a woman?

  Abstract: WERE THEY EVER TO MEET, it is doubtful that Gaylord Kambarami would think much of Godfrey Nzira’s Christianity. Kambarami’s understanding of Christianity emerges out of a tradition in which “the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible” is a clarion call. Kambarami wants to put a Bible in the hands of every Zimbabwean. The image that his goal brings to mind is animated by the palpable sense that Christianity can be quantified; the more Bibles there are, the more Christianity there is. For Kambarami, the Bible is not a representation but a presence. When Zimbabweans are joined together<br>

  Abstract: The decade that followed the events of July 1952 critically altered the conventional assumptions of post–World War I Egyptian historiography. This impact was obvious. A variety of state-owned media invoked the memory of past events on a daily basis. Indeed, over the years, scholars had been drawn to the extensive usage of the past during the 1950s. Subscribing to the idea that the task of historiography is mainly that of studying shifts in historical representation, they emphasized the changing image of several rulers and popular leaders.¹ Though the issue of changing historical images was the most visible historiographical trait<br>

  Abstract: Imagism has created an “image” of Oriental cultures projected in language. Whether in Pound’s giant pancultural program or in Lowell’s intertextual travel narrative, an Orientalist “image,” in the form of both poetic effect and cultural description, stands out conspicuously, like “petals on a wet, black bough.” This double meaning of “image” thus bespeaks the twin projects that the Imagist Pound and Lowell were pursuing: on the one hand they were creating a modernist poetry, and on the other hand they were writing ethnographies of the Far East and looking at culture from a particular standpoint.

It first appeared in his 1933 speech “Mentjapai Indonesia Merdeka” (Achieving an Independent Indonesia), quoted in the epigraph above, but nowhere was it more significant than in his famous “Birth of the Pancasila” speech, of June 1, 1945.¹ Speaking to a committee of Japanese officials, Javanese aristocrats, and elite nationalist politicians who had been convened to explore the possibility of Indonesian national independence, he argued that political independence must precede rather than follow from the resolution of such “petty issues”<br>

  Abstract: Woman has been associated in a stereotypical way with both good and evil. As an “angel in the house,” woman has been credited with natural goodness, an innate allegiance to “a law of kindness.” But this same description extols her as infantile, weak, and mindless—a creature in constant need of male supervision and protection. Undertones of sadism run throughout Coventry Patmore’s hymn to the angel who is in reality a prisoner in the house she graces.¹ The alleged angel was an image that all Victorian women were supposed to internalize.

  Book Title: To Make the Hands Impure: Art, Ethical Adventure, the Difficult and the Holy-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): NEWTON ADAM ZACHARY<br>
  Abstract: How can cradling, handling, or rubbing a text be said, ethically, to have made something happen? What, as readers or interpreters, may come off in our hands in as we maculate or mark the books we read? For Adam Zachary Newton, reading is anembodied practice wherein "ethics" becomes a matter of tact in the doubled sense of touch and regard. With the image of the book lying in the hands of its readers as insistent refrain, To Make the Hands Impure cuts a provocative cross-disciplinary swath through classical Jewish texts, modern Jewish philosophy, film and performance, literature, translation, and the material text. Newton explores the ethics of reading through a range of texts, from the Talmud and Midrash to Conrad's Nostromo and Pascal's Le Memorial, from works by Henry Darger and Martin Scorsese to the National September 11 Memorial and a synagogue in Havana, Cuba. In separate chapters, he conducts masterly treatments of Emmanuel Levinas, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Stanley Cavell by emphasizing their performances as readers a trebled orientation to Talmud, novel, and theater/film. To Make the Hands Impure stages the encounter of literary experience and scriptural traditions he difficult and the holy through an ambitious, singular, and innovative approach marked in equal measure by erudition and imaginative daring.<br>

  Author(s) Schwartz Barry<br>
  Abstract: As with his apostolic counterparts, the reputation of Peter in the early centuries of the Christian movement is described best as “mixed.” One need look no further than the undisputed Pauline epistles, the earliest Christian writings, to see that Peter is portrayed in both negative and positive ways. On the one hand, Paul portrays Peter as both the first to see the risen Christ (1 Cor 15:3) and as one of three “pillars” in the Jerusalem church (Gal 2:9). On the other hand, these positive descriptions are tempered by the image of Peter retained in Paul’s account of the dispute<br>

  Author(s) Paci Viva<br>
  Abstract: “Cinema is the moving image”: the idea, which has become a commonplace, coalesced around 1900 as photography was being referred to as the still image. The opposition between photography and cinema made it possible throughout the twentieth century, and to this day, to assign distinct tasks in the representation of reality to each of these emblematic dispositives of modernity. Still, the association still/moving also structured the cinematographic dispositive as such as early as the late nineteenth century. Indeed, photography was not the other of cinema at the time, but a means used by “cinema” in its chronophotographic stage to reconstitute<br>

  Abstract: The folklore documentaryis ubiquitous. In a world bombarded by visual images, most of us have become not only receivers of the image but its manipulators as well. We take photographs, produce home movies, and shoot videotape of life’s events. Often, these visual documents represent the realm of folklore: they record such events as birthday parties, weddings, ethnic gatherings, and religious occasions. At the same time, the films and videos we create reveal much about ustous and others.¹ As a folklorist, filmmaker, and videographer, I believe the use of film and video becomes a reflexive process of interpreting<br>

  Book Title: Passage to the Center-Imagination and the Sacred in the Poetry of Seamus Heaney<br>
  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Tobin Daniel<br>
  Abstract: Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, author of nine collections of poetry and three volumes of influential essays, is regarded by many as the greatest Irish poet since Yeats.
      Passage to the Centeris the most comprehensive critical treatment to date on Heaney's poetry and the first to study Heaney's body of work up toSeeing ThingsandThe Spirit Level. It is also the first to examine the poems from the perspective of religion, one of Heaney's guiding preoccupations. According to Tobin, the growth of Heaney's poetry may be charted through the recurrent figure of "the center," a key image in the relationship that evolved over time between the poet and his inherited place, an evolution that involved the continual re-evaluation and re-vision of imaginative boundaries. In a way that previous studies have not, Tobin's work examines Heaney's poetry in the context of modernist and postmodernist concerns about the desacralizing of civilization and provides a challenging engagement with the work of a living master.<br>

It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.” Kept as a reminder in Heaney’s poetry notebook, Gaston Bachelard’s warning could stand as the motto for Heaney’s early work.¹ In
                  Death of a Naturalist,the silent things given speech through the poet’s art derive primarily from his personal history, from the rhythms of the yard experienced in childhood. Not surprisingly, Narcissus is the book’s presiding deity, in whose image Heaney “rhymes to see himself.” With Heaney’s second book,<br>

  Abstract: The nature of humanity, our relationship with each other, and our relationship with the sacred is the starting point for reflections on theological anthropology. For centuries Christians have wrestled with defining what makes us particular in light of our humanity yet at the same time interconnected with God’s creation. Musings on this subject range from abstract philosophical speculation, to dialogue with the natural sciences, to a serious consideration of the diversity and complexity of the embodied human condition.

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

The print’s beginnings in Western Europe¹ coincided roughly with the development of the printing press and movable type. Indeed, the impact of the biblical print is in some ways analogous to that of the printed text. Just as the printing press made possible the broader dissemination of the Bible, the print made biblical images widely available. Likewise, translations of the Bible into local vernaculars made the text accessible to those who could not read the Latin Vulgate, just as the printed image “told” the biblical<br>

  Abstract: Thierry Groensteen argues that “the narrative techniques and processes that are used in manga give the reader the feeling of being immersed in the action, whereas Western comics create a more distant relation between the reader and the narrative” (27). It goes without saying that both “Western” and “Eastern” graphic narratives escape such generalization. However, Angela Moreno Acosta’s redrawing of one sequence from Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese visualizes what has come to dominate the global image of manga, including Groensteen’s, namely the assumption that this kind of comics is particularly qualified for highlighting emotions, moods, and private interpersonal<br>

  Abstract: There are two contrasting images of Islamic economics that are often evoked today, and both are wrong. One is that Islamic finance has done well in the banking crises that began in the twenty-first century, the implication being that it is more solidly based and less speculative. Opposed to that is the image of Islam as an obstacle to the flourishing of the economies of the Islamic world because it is so restrictive as to what can be done with money and how property can be passed down to the next generation.

  Abstract: As new social practices were introduced into Japan during the early Meiji period, they disseminated unevenly from the cities to the countryside. While Western fashions were adopted initially among the elite, who had ties to the government and who were concerned about promoting Japan’s image as a civilized nation, they soon spread to members of the middle class, who embraced Westernization as a means of social mobility and distinction. The high cost of Western fashions limited their widespread appeal, but by the Taisho period (1912–1926) and the introduction of uniformed clothing in various work professions, Western fashion became increasingly<br>

Especially in these latter instances, saturation pertained to a parametric phenomenon: the notion referred to the fact that all twelve tones on the chromatic scale occurred in the sound field or the relevant chord form.<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

  Abstract: This volume has traced the development of the Traveller image as ‘Other’ through mythical and binary discourses of alterity. Until the recent arrival of a more overtly multicultural society in Ireland Travellers have constituted the ‘Other’ for mainstream Irish society. As ‘Other’ they have often acted as objects on whom power is exercised. Their representation and the roles constructed for them have been determined primarily by the settled community and have been influenced by the need to define national, social and class identity. This project of representation has used the tools of mythology and history. These two related aspects of<br>

To perceive the landscape is therefore to carry out an act of remembrance, and remembering is not so much a matter of calling up an internal image, stored in the mind, as of engaging perceptually with an environment that is itself pregnant with the past (Ingold, 1993, p. 152).<br>

  Book Title: Leaving the North-Migration and Memory, Northern Ireland 1921–2011<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Trew Johanne Devlin<br>
  Abstract: Leaving the North is the first book that provides a comprehensive survey of Northern Ireland migration since 1921. Based largely on the personal memories of emigrants who left Northern Ireland from the 1920s to the 2000s, approximately half of whom eventually returned, the book traces their multigenerational experiences of leaving Northern Ireland and adapting to life abroad, with some later returning to a society still mired in conflict. Contextualised by a review of the statistical and policy record, the emigrants’ stories reveal that contrary to its well-worn image as an inward-looking place – 'such narrow ground' – Northern Ireland has a rather dynamic migration history, demonstrating that its people have long been looking outward as well as inward, well connected with the wider world. But how many departed and where did they go? And what of the Northern Ireland Diaspora? How has the view of the ‘troubled’ homeland from abroad, especially among expatriates, contributed to progress along the road to peace? In addressing these questions, the book treats the relationship between migration, sectarianism and conflict, immigration and racism, repatriation and the Peace Process, with particular attention to the experience of Northern Ireland migrants in the two principal receiving societies – Britain and Canada. With the emigration of young people once again on the increase due to the economic downturn, it is perhaps timely to learn from the experiences of the people who have been ‘leaving the North’ over many decades; not only to acknowledge their departure but in the hope that we might better understand the challenges and opportunities that migration and Diaspora can present.<br>

  Abstract: In his discussion on the best possible relationship between science and non-science (in which he included religion and the arts), Friedrich Nietzsche decided on the image of human beings having ‘a double brain’: a brain with two chambers lying next to one another, as it were, separable and self-contained, and experiencing different things without confusion (1994: 154). An experience of both science and non-science was necessary for human health, Nietzsche deemed, but at the same time the two had to be kept apart. Non-science inspired and was the source of human strength, while science was the source of truth, direction<br>

  Abstract: The texts by Benjamin, Nancy, Serres, Debray, and Peters are all extremely different. It may seem peculiar to invoke these authors as ‘introductions’ to the theme of mediality when only the last one actually discusses concrete media, yet this is quite deliberate. I want to debate the question of ‘What is a medium?’ from the very beginning in the context of mediality. ‘Mediality’ does not refer to media that are distinct from each other, like sound, text, and image, but rather its aim is to describe an elementary dimension of human life and culture.¹<br>

  Book Title: Le bal des arts-Le sujet et l’image : écrire avec l’art<br>
  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Rolla Chiara<br>
  Abstract: Aujourd’hui, les frontières des formes artistiques tendent à devenir de plus en plus indéfinissables sous l’effet d’une intense activité de circulation, d’hybridation et de métissage conduisant à la naissance de nouveaux régimes de la création et à la composition d’oeuvres complexes et multiples. Les textes littéraires n’échappent pas à cette transformation mettant en scène de nouveaux paradigmes de lecture et de signification par l’expérimentation d’autres manières de dire la réalité, de raconter des histoires, de se poser face au monde. Le sujet, son statut et les modalités de sa présence dans les oeuvres littéraires qui entretiennent une relation avec les autres arts, sont autant d’axes privilégiés dans ce volume. En transgressant les frontières entre les arts, les oeuvres donnent à voir et à penser des univers de signification et de représentation élargis devant lesquels le sujet bénéficie en retour d’un accroissement de ses capacités de compréhension et d’invention. Dans ces textes la communication entre les différentes formes artistiques se trouve mise en jeu au point qu’il ne suffit plus de la définir en termes d’hybridation, et qu’il convient peut-être mieux d’y réfléchir en termes d’intermédialité. Le présent volume reprend ces thématiques de recherche et ces interrogations ; il les approfondit et les développe en déchiffrant des pratiques d’écriture contemporaines qui entretiennent des rapports étroits avec les arts et les techniques de l’image. Les mises au point théoriques et méthodologiques côtoient des analyses pointues et des propositions d’interprétation de phénomènes nouveaux et encore peu définis par la critique.<br>

  Author(s): Widding Astrid Söderbergh<br>
  Abstract: In 1888, Thomas Edison announced that he was experimenting on "an instrument which does for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear, which is the recording and reproduction of things in motion." Just as Edison's investigations were framed in terms of the known technologies of the phonograph and the microscope, the essays in this collection address the contexts of innovation and reception that have framed the development of moving images in the last 100 years. Three concerns are of particular interest: the contexts of innovation and reception for moving image technologies; the role of the observer, whose vision and cognitive processes define some of the limits of inquiry and epistemological insight; and the role of new media, which, engaging with the domestic sphere as cultural interface, are transforming our understanding of public and private spheres.<br>

  Abstract: The notion of French exceptionalism is deeply embedded in the nation's self-image and in a range of political and academic discourses. Recently, the debate about whether France really is "exceptional" has acquired a critical edge. Against the background of introspection about the nature of "national identity," some proclaim "normalisation" and the end of French exceptionalism, while others point out to the continuing evidence that France remains distinctive at a number of levels, from popular culture to public policy. This book explores the notion of French exceptionalism, places it in its European context, examines its history and evaluate its continuing relevance in a range of fields from politics and public policy to popular culture and sport.<br>

As a social construction, time is a narrative through which events and nonevents are ordered in relation to people. Within society, time sets some crucial standards for living. Both individuals and societies try to reproduce themselves and try to keep themselves healthy, sometimes in conflicting ways.

It is “homogeneous with religions,” but even within religion, it is never religious (

  Book Title: The Heart Has Its Reasons-Towards a Theological Anthropology of the Heart<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Tóth Beáta<br>
  Abstract: This book explores a hitherto neglected area of theological anthropology: the unity of human emotionality and rationality embodied in the biblical concept of the heart. While the theological contours of human reason have for long been clearly drawn and presented as the exclusive seat of the image of God, affectivity has been relegated to a secondary position. With the reintegration of the body into recent philosophical and theological discourses, a number of questions have arisen: if the image (also) resides in the body, how does this change one’s view of the theological significance of human affectivity? In what way is our likeness to God realized in the whole of what we are? Can one overcome the traditional dissociation between intellect and affectivity by a renewed theory of love? In conversation with patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Irenaeus, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Aquinas) and in dialogue with more recent interlocutors (Pascal, Ricoeur, Marion, Milbank, John Paul II), this work pursues a novel theological vision of the essential unity of our humanity.<br>

  Book Title: Life in the Spirit-A Post-Constantinian and Trinitarian Account of the Christian Life<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): snavely Andréa D.<br>
  Abstract: Christians are united in saying that the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. But the unity breaks down when explaining how the Christian life is a life in the Spirit. Life in the Spirit is the first book to engage the post-Constantinian critique of the church with the field of Spirit Christology. Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of the Divine Suffering, Volume 2. Evil and Divine Suffering<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the second volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, vol. 2, Evil and Divine Suffering. The larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, then to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. This second volume of studies proceeds on the basis of the presuppositions of this symbol, those implicit attestations that provide the conditions of possibility for divine suffering-that which constitutes divine vulnerability with respect to creation-as identified and examined in the first volume of this project: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life-the imago Dei as love. The second volume then investigates the first two divine wounds or modes of divine suffering to which the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally attest: (1) divine grief, suffering because of betrayal by the beloved human or human sin; and (2) divine self-sacrifice, suffering for the beloved human in its bondage to sin or misery, to establish the possibility of redemption and reconciliation. Each divine wound, thus, constitutes a response to a creaturely occasion. The suffering in each divine wound also occurs in two stages: a passive stage and an active stage. In divine grief, God suffers because of human sin, betrayal of the divine lover by the beloved human: divine sorrow as the passive stage of divine grief; and divine angui~<br>

  Abstract: Authors such as Juergensmeyer and Jones do not sufficiently attend to the distinction between genuine and false religion, nor do they explore the different moral horizons that inform religious agents’ reasons for warfare. There can be no doubt that the sacred texts of religious traditions also in-fluence the moral horizons of believers, whether or not those texts have been communicated and received after critical and responsible interpretation. Judeo-Christian and Islamic religious texts, uncritically examined, can lead one to conclude that religious traditions present a preoccupation with warfare and an image of a warrior God. The Old Testament Scriptures give many<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter develops the first half of an exposition of the second major presupposition of the Christian symbol of divine suffering. As I have mentioned already, most specifically, this presupposition takes the following form:
                  God has created human life or being, through the actualization of the divine being as love in God’s self-limiting creative activity, in the image of God with the being or life of love. Working on the basis of the abstraction of being or life from its actualization, this chapter will identify and analyze the formal and material structures of the human as the image of God,<br>

  Abstract: De l'écrit à l'écran est le premier ouvrage qui aborde la question de la réécriture filmique du roman africain francophone. Il se sert de la sémiologie de l'image, de la poétique et des théories post-coloniales pour définir les enjeux théoriques, idéologiques et sémantiques régissant le passage des textes littéraires au cinéma. Il identifie des paramètres importants dans la poétique de l'écriture et montre le rôle de l'acte créateur dans l'altérité du texte dérivé, filmique, par rapport au texte de départ, littéraire. De ce fait, il formule des propositions novatrices par rapport aux interrogations purement spéculatives, thématiques ou idéologiques sur « l'adaptation », acte de recréation et de réécriture dont les mécanismes dépassent le seul cadre des cinémas africains.<br>

  Abstract: Le statut de « la femme » africaine a toujours donné lieu à des interrogations brûlantes, et même à des passions. Le discours masculin qui, selon Carole Boy ce Davis et Anne A. Graves (1990), se réduit à l’exaltation d'une beauté exotique ou à la protection de l’image d’une femme féconde, comme celui élaboré « ailleurs » et qui considère la femme comme catégorie universelle de création, dégage en permanence un malaise. Et on se demande toujours si elle est une « femme », éventuellement noire, ou simplement une « femme africaine », dont il convient de légitimer la représentation.<br>

  Book Title: Entre lieux et mémoire-L'inscription de la francophonie canadienne dans la durée<br>
  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): THÉRIAULT Joseph Yvon<br>
  Abstract: Dans Les lieux de mémoire, Pierre Nora affirme que « la mémoire s'enracine dans le concret, l'espace, le geste, l'image et l'objet » (1984, xix). Entre lieux et mémoire adopte une perspective semblable et jette un regard sur les expériences concrètes, géographiquement situées, par lesquelles les francophones du Canada construisent leur identité à partir des réminiscences de leur passé. Ce questionnement est essentiel, car la géographie de la francophonie canadienne évolue rapidement, consolidée au Québec au cours notamment des dernières cinquante années, mais fragilisée dans les milieux les plus dynamiques de la francophonie hors Québec, là où les francophones se confrontent quotidiennement à l'Autre : anglophone, immigrant et allophone. Dans ces lieux consolidés et fluides se tissent les appartenances et les identités de ceux qui les occupent. Les auteurs abordent les lieux de mémoire du Canada français selon trois approches : l'histoire, la géographie et les arts. Tous mettent en évidence que la fondation d'un lieu de mémoire est un acte politique. Enfin, ils montrent qu'une étude des lieux de mémoire, par l'entremise des individus et des groupes qui les instituent, constitue un préalable à la compréhension de l'identité francophone canadienne, dans son unité comme dans sa diversité.<br>

  Abstract: Depuis la parution, en 1984, de l’imposant ouvrage dirigé par Pierre Nora, l’importance des lieux de mémoire dans la construction des identités collectives n’est plus à prouver. En effet, Nora montre bien que les lieux de mémoire s’avèrent essentiels, puisqu’ils permettent de cristalliser l’héritage collectif d’une communauté. Fortement symboliques, ils « servent de repères historiques à la collectivité, ils condensent l’image qu’elle a de son histoire en faisant intervenir autant l’émotionnel que le rationnel » (Poumet, 2005). Ils ne se réduisent donc pas aux monuments, sites et objets, traces du passé, mais incluent aussi les fêtes, les devises, les chants<br>

  Abstract: Peint et chanté, voilé ou dévoilé, usé et abusé, le corps féminin est depuis toujours au centre de la création artistique occidentale. Qu'en est-il, cependant, de sa place dans les sciences sociales ? Comment le corps des femmes a-t-il été pensé et représenté en sociologie, en criminologie, en travail social ou en gérontologie, par exemple ? Cet ouvrage collectif a pour premier objectif d'amorcer ce travail critique en débusquant les logiques patriarcales qui dominent les discours savants développés dans les différentes disciplines des sciences sociales et mettant en scène le corps des femmes. Ce faisant, il montre également comment se sont historiquement construites, et se construisent encore, des représentations de corps de femmes illégitimes ou transgresseurs ou dangereux. Le second objectif de cet ouvrage est de repenser cette image en mettant en lumière les multiples façons que les femmes peuvent utiliser pour subvertir ces représentations dominantes et pour se poser comme sujets tant dans l'élaboration des savoirs que dans la sphère du politique.<br>

  Abstract: Within the spectrum of possibilities and probabilities in constructing an image of the historical Jesus, the message of “good news for the poor” usually lies at the probability end of the authenticity scale. That Jesus emphasized the poor has the support of source texts and coheres with his social context. As James Dunn (2003, 517) observes, “the proclamation of the good news to the poor evidently ranked at the forefront of Jesus’s conception of his mission.” Key texts include the Beatitudes, in what is generally agreed to be their earlier form, in which Jesus declares, “Blessed are you who are<br>

Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty. Accordingly, if the Son is the Father’s image,<br>

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Herman David<br>
  Abstract: Ethos and Narrative Interpretationexamines the fruitfulness of the concept of ethos for the theory and analysis of literary narrative. The notion of ethos refers to the broadly persuasive effects of the image one may have of a speaker's psychology, world view, and emotional or ethical stance. How and why do readers attribute an ethos (of, for example, sincerity, reliability, authority, or irony) to literary characters, narrators, and even to authors? Are there particular conditions under which it is more appropriate for interpreters to attribute an ethos to authors, rather than to narrators? In the answer Liesbeth Korthals Altes proposes to such questions, ethos attributions are deeply implicated in the process of interpreting and evaluating narrative texts.<br>

Instead of isolating novelists, characters, and readers, those limits are precisely what allow them to be aware of the world beyond themselves.

  Author(s): GREFFE Xavier<br>
  Abstract: Le patrimoine culturel n’est pas qu’une simple trace du passé. Il est le lieu où se rencontrent et s’hybrident les expériences et les valeurs des uns et des autres ; il est rhizome. Au-delà de son existence en soi, il tire sa valeur des différents usages que l’on peut en faire, voire des liens qu’il permet de tisser entre les personnes et les communautés. Il ne s’agit plus seulement de l’identifier et de le préserver coûte que coûte, mais de le mettre en scène au bénéfice des objets comme des sujets. Examinant cette interdépendance croissante entre mémoires, pratiques et expériences, l’auteur analyse le fonctionnement du patrimoine culturel selon trois perspectives, soit la délimitation de son champ, ses représentations et les valeurs que l’on en retire. Exposant le flottement du patrimoine culturel entre devise d’identité et levier de développement, il montre l’équilibre qu’il faut rechercher entre un arrêt sur image qui pourrait déboucher sur la fétichisation de l’objet et une fuite en avant qui ­tarirait son potentiel en création.<br>

  Book Title: Amin Maalouf: une oeuvre à revisiter-  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): El Kettani Soundouss<br>
  Abstract: L’écrivain franco-libanais Amin Maalouf est paré d’une image de passeur de cultures, de chantre des exilés et d’ambassadeur des immigrants. Chrétien au Liban, Arabe en France, il semble irrémédiablement minoritaire, irrémédiablement étranger. Il revendique d’ailleurs lui-même ce rôle de médiateur entre l’Orient et l’Occident, prêchant pour un monde du multiculturalisme et de l’identité multiple. Commentateurs et critiques accolent ainsi à son œuvre l’étiquette de la poursuite d’une communion universelle des peuples, l’abordant principalement au regard des questions d’identité, d’exil, de quête des origines et d’appartenances multiples. Le présent ouvrage revisite l’œuvre de ce grand auteur qu’est Amin Maalouf – lauréat du prix Goncourt en 1993 et membre de l’Académie française depuis 2011 – afin de mettre en évidence la complexité de celle-ci et de montrer les diverses voies empruntées pour revenir sans cesse à des images et à des leitmotivs obsessifs. De la cartographie de l’œuvre de Maalouf aux questions de sa réception et de sa lecture, en passant par des perspectives culturelles, idéologiques et politiques, il balise de nouvelles pistes d’interprétation. Premier ouvrage collectif à porter exclusivement sur Amin Maalouf, il réunit des contributions du Canada, de la France, du Maroc, du Cameroun et de l’Afrique du Sud. Se concluant sur une entrevue exclusive avec Amin Maalouf, il saura éveiller la curiosité pour cette œuvre qui, de lecture en relecture, fait surgir ce sens profond de l’humanité et conduit à parcourir autrement la terre et ses frontières, la mer et ses rivages.<br>

Clothing is a powerful image throughout biblical literature and in human society generally.¹ At the most obvious level, clothing covers and conceals the body, protecting it from exposure to the elements and the view of other persons. But the significance of clothing extends much further since garments not only cover and conceal, but also function to display the body in particular ways and with many meanings. The ways in which bodies are clothed have far-reaching and sometimes<br>

Many of these images, through the course of the Johannine narrative, take on the character of religious symbols: vehicles of the divine world.

  Author(s) Kotsakis Kostas<br>
  Abstract: Figurines provide enticing images through which to imagine otherwise remote and faceless prehistoric communities. Early examples from Cyprus feature recurrently on the covers of monographs, excavation reports and conference posters (
                  e.g.Colemanet al.1996; Tatton-Brown 1997; Knapp 2008); a Chalcolithic figurine was even deemed an apposite image for the one euro coin. Although for modern audiences, figurines have become convenient symbols, embodying and displaying Cyprus’s past identities, researchers are well aware that these complex objects encompass far more than simply passive reflections of past realities. Prehistoric figurines were symbolically-charged objects with clear, active roles in shaping the socio-political landscape<br>

  Abstract: So the melancholy that speaks from the pages of Benjamin’s essays—private depressions, professional discouragement, the dejection of the outsider, distress in the face of a political and historical nightmare—searches the past for an adequate object, for some emblem or image at which, as in religious meditation, the mind can stare itself out, in which it can find momentary, if only aesthetic, relief. It finds it: in the Germany of the Thirty Years’ War, in the Paris “capital of the nineteenth century.” For they are both—the Baroque and the modern—in their very essence allegorical, and they match<br>

  Abstract: It would be difficult to overstate the impact of technologies of mechanical reproduction on the visual culture of Weimar Germany, as a flood of images from photography and film upended conventional models of cultural literacy following the media boom of the early 1920s. Within this context film has attracted far greater attention than photography because of its explosive potential as a mimetic medium that can convey a sense of unfolding time and engender fresh modes of collective reception. Yet the photographic image was an even more ubiquitous and flexible instrument of visual dissemination because of the unprecedented proliferation of newspapers<br>

Consider the case of the fig leaf, a term that once, and not all that long ago, had a fairly secure referent, both in the Bible and in the history of art. But somewhere along the way the image—and the reference—parted company with the figure of speech. “Fig leaf ” today means something, for sure. Journalists use it all the time, and it is often to be found in newspaper headlines. But

This has been fuelled further by the recognition of the inherent ambiguity of these concepts. Awareness of the precariousness of our assumptions about what human beings are like has not only affected intellectuals, prompting philosophers and social scientists to embark on a searching interrogation, but has also penetrated into the policymaking and the public domain.

  Abstract: So begins the book of Lamentations (1:1), written following the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem (586 BCE) and arguably one of the clearest expressions of trauma literature in the Hebrew Bible. The image of the isolated and bereaved woman, violated, degraded, lacking anyone to comfort her, represents well the traumatic impact of war and devastation. Metaphorically rich, this personification of the city as woman—Daughter Zion—holds in tension both the personal, individual reality of suffering and a recognition of communal suffering.<br>

  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new.

  Book Title: Children of God in the World-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): O’Callaghan Paul<br>
  Abstract: Children of God in the World is a textbook of theological anthropology structured in four parts. The first attempts to clarify the relationship between theology, philosophy and science in their respective approaches to anthropology, and establishes the fundamental principle of the text, stated in Vatican II's Gaudium et spes, n. 22, "Christ manifests man to man." The second part provides a historical overview of the doctrine of grace: in Scripture (especially the teaching of the book of Genesis on humans 'made in the image of God', as well as Paul and John), among the Fathers (in particular the oriental doctrine of 'divinization' and Augustine), during the Middle Ages (especially Thomas Aquinas) and the Reformation period (centered particularly on Luther and the Council of Trent), right up to modern times. The third part of the text, the central one, provides a systematic understanding of Christian grace in terms of the God's life present in human believers by which they become children of God, disciples, friends and brothers of Christ, temples of the Holy Spirit. This section also provides a reflection on the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), on the relationship between grace and human freedom, on the role of the Church and Christian apostolate in the communication of grace, and on the need humans have for divine grace. After considering the relationship between the natural and the supernatural order, the fourth and last part deals with different philosophical aspects of the human condition, in the light of Christian faith: the union between body and soul, humans as free, historical, social, sexual and working beings. The last chapter concludes with a consideration of the human person, Christianity's greatest and most enduring contribution to human thought.<br>

  Abstract: The question “Why are there no photographs of the Famine?” appears, at the outset, to be one easily answered. With photography in its infancy in Ireland (invented only in 1839 and in limited practice by the mid-1840s, primarily by wealthy Anglo-Irish hobbyists and a small handful of enthusiasts and budding entrepreneurs¹), very few of the extant images dating to the Famine period deal in any way with social subjects, and no contemporaneous image of the Famine has been identified.² Yet there are several reasons why photography’s relationship to the Famine persists in significance despite this historical absence.

  Abstract: It has been noted that “the language of memory does seem to be above all a language of images” (Kuhn 2000, 188). Susan Sontag argues that photography’s preeminence within the “language” of memory stems from the mechanics of how memory operates, in that it “freeze-frames”; its “basic unit is the single image” (2004, 19). If we accept that “there is no such thing as an authentic origin of memory, since all memory, whether preserved in image, word, or sound, is grounded in representation” (van Dijik 2004, 268), we must accept too that there is no such thing as an authentic<br>

By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

  Author(s): Carroll Noël<br>
  Abstract: Noël Carroll, a brilliant and provocative philosopher of film, has gathered in this book eighteen of his most recent essays on cinema and television-what Carroll calls "moving images." The essays discuss topics in philosophy, film theory, and film criticism.Drawing on concepts from cognitive psychology and analytic philosophy, Carroll examines a wide range of fascinating topics. These include film attention, the emotional address of the moving image, film and racism, the nature and epistemology of documentary film, the moral status of television, the concept of film style, the foundations of film evaluation, the film theory of Siegfried Kracauer, the ideology of the professional western, and films by Sergei Eisenstein and Yvonne Rainer. Carroll also assesses the state of contemporary film theory and speculates on its prospects. The book continues many of the themes of Carroll's earlier work
      Theorizing the Moving Imageand develops them in new directions. A general introduction by George Wilson situates Carroll's essays in relation to his view of moving-image studies.<br>

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

A small, thin boy standing alone and forlorn in an Amsterdam street clasps an empty tin, in case food might be found at one of the soup kitchens. Boy with a Pan is one of hundreds of photographs Andriesse took as a member of the clandestine group that came to be known as “The Underground Photographers” (De Ondergedoken Camera).<br>

  Book Title: Precarious Visualities-New Perspectives on Identification in Contemporary Art and Visual Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Ross Christine<br>
  Abstract: Through the study of exemplary media works and practices - photography, film, video, performance, installations, web cams - scholars from various disciplines call attention to the unsettling of identification and the disablement of vision in contemporary aesthetics. To look at an image that prevents the stabilization of identification, identity and place; to perceive a representation that oscillates between visibility and invisibility; to relate to an image which entails a rebalancing of sight through the valorization of other senses; to be exposed, through surveillance devices, to the gaze of new figures of authority - the aesthetic experiences examined here concern a spectator whose perception lacks in certainty, identification, and opticality what it gains in fallibility, complexity, and interrelatedness. Precarious Visualities provides a new understanding of spectatorship as a relation that is at once corporeal and imaginary, and persistently prolific in its cultural, social, and political effects. Contributors include Raymond Bellour (École des hautes études en sciences sociales), Monika Kin Gagnon (Concordia University), Beate Ochsner (University of Mannheim -Universität Mannheim), Claudette Lauzon (McGill University), David Tomas (Université du Québec à Montréal), Slavoj Zizek (Ljubljiana University and University of London), Marie Fraser (Université du Québec à Montréal), Alice Ming Wai Jim (Concordia University), Julie Lavigne (Université du Québec à Montréal), Amelia Jones (University of Manchester), Eric Michaud (École des hautes études en sciences sociales), Hélène Samson (McCord Museum), and Thierry Bardini (Université de Montréal).<br>

  Author(s) Fox Stephanie<br>
  Abstract: Part 6 concentrates on the generating function of the image – its ability to form the self, its genetic representation of the self, and the performative use of the metaphor in scientific descriptions of the genetic code. The visualities set into play here fundamentally break with the mimetic functioning of art to rethink the power of the image in the context of the modern development of genetics and molecular biology. The first chapter, Éric Michaud’s “The Descent of the Image,” proposes a transhistorical reading of the generating/generative function of the image – the manipulation of iconic signs to modify human descent through<br>

  Book Title: Saints Alive-Word, Image, and Enactment in the Lives of the Saints<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): WILLIAMS DAVID<br>
  Abstract: David Williams shows that images associated with saints are not simply illustrations of written accounts, nor are the gestures, prayers, and liturgical practices of devotees of saints' cults simply derivative of them. Rather, images and enactments expand and complete the text, adding visual and dramatic dimensions. Williams demonstrates his ideas through discussion and case studies of three saints: the biblical figure of Saint Anne, mother of the Virgin; the medieval English martyr Saint Thomas Becket; and Saint Maximillian Mary Kolbe, who gave his life to save that of another in the Auschwitz concentration camp. A remarkable study of text, image, and enactment, Saints Alive presents a complete study of the depiction of saints that will change the way they are understood.<br>

  Abstract: The great power of words consists in their ability to represent thought as language, enabling the speaker to communicate complicated intellectual processes and extensive discursive descriptions. No other sign system achieves this. The image, although more effective than the word in presenting in a solitary, contained way what it represents, cannot comment on its object or analyze its own method of representation as language can. Similarly, gesture, or enactment, while performing what it represents and, in this sense, closer to its object, cannot reflect upon itself or the nature of its own operation.

Under the influence of managed care and public policy regulations—and under the pressure of public image of medical professionals—physicians are asked and indeed demanded to deliver the highest quality medicine at the lowest possible cost to the greatest number of people. As patients increasingly become “customers” and “consumers,” physicians find their roles undergoing a transformation to those of “retailers” and “providers” in the delivery of a market commodity—namely, health care.

  Abstract: Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production. The chapters in this collection pose questions, unsettle assumptions, and generate broad imaginative spaces for thinking about representation of pregnancy, birth, and parenting. They demonstrate the ways in which practices of consuming and using representations carry within them the productive forces of creation. Bringing together an eclectic and vibrant range of perspectives, this collection offers readers the possibility to rethink and reimagine the diverse meanings and practices of representations of these significant life events. Engaging theoretical reflection and creative image making, the contributors explore a broad range of cultural signs with a focus on challenging authoritative representations in a manner that seeks to reveal rather than conceal the insistently problematic and contestable nature of image culture. Natal Signs gathers an exciting set of critically engaged voices to reflect on some of life’s most meaningful moments in ways that affirm natality as the renewed promise of possibility.Natal Signs: Cultural Representations of Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting explores some of the ways in which reproductive experiences are taken up in the rich arena of cultural production.

  Abstract: The prevalence of imagery and metaphor related to pregnancy, birth, and mothering in Indigenous cultures of Turtle Island reveal the significance of these life events within these communities. While negative representations of Indigenous women are used by colonizing forces to legitimize extermination and assimilation projects, Indigenous artistic representations of pregnancy, birth, and mothering continue to be a powerful tool to push back against these efforts. Artwork by contemporary Indigenous artists depicting pregnancy, birth, and mothering present a positive image of contemporary cultures, recognizing the ceremonial value of these experiences and creating powerful narratives of Indigenous women and communities.<br>

  Book Title: Verità Immagine Normatività / Truth, Image, and Normativity-  Publisher: Quodlibet<br>
  Author(s): Loddo Olimpia G.<br>
  Abstract: Siamo ormai lontani dalla stagione in cui la forza propulsiva della “svolta linguistica" si impose come tendenza dominante nel dibattito filosofico. Da varie angolazioni si è potuto parlare negli ultimi anni di pictorial turn come antidoto all’egemonia del paradigma linguistico in filosofia. Il volume Verità, Immagine, Normatività. Truth, Image, and Normativity non si inserisce direttamente in questa nuova tendenza, ma ruota comunque intorno a questioni che derivano dal medesimo sfondo. I 24 saggi qui raccolti tengono conto dei diversi ruoli che le immagini possono svolgere, a seconda che si focalizzi la loro dimensione descrittiva o normativa, e indagano alcuni aspetti del rapporto tra immagine e linguaggio. Questi problemi di filosofia dell’immagine, intesa sia come immagine cognitiva sia come immagine grafica, costituiscono il fil rouge di questo volume. Una tale riflessione sui linguaggi figurati e sulla comunicazione visiva non-linguistica costringe a riformulare in termini nuovi le grandi domande concernenti le tradizionali nozioni di verità, oggettività, normatività, consenso e persuasione.<br>

Today we have spin doctors and image consultants, audience-manipulators of every ideological stripe—hence the much discussed flight of audiences from the public arena.

In the second scene, the theme of retribution (punishment) surfaces as the inexorable response to his desecration. Both the crime and punishment of Fyodor, in the poetics of Dostoevsky, belong to the realm of “bezobrazie (the morally and esthetically “monstrous” or “shapeless”) and involve the disfiguration of man made in the image and likeness of God.<br>

These accounts correlatively naturalize a subject who comprehends and controls her surroundings. When Levinas identifies the deformalization of time as central to his philosophical work, he is thus engaged in the critique of the image of subjectivity presupposed by formal conceptions of time. Starting in the late 1960s, Levinas describes time’s “meaningful content somehow prior to form” as traumatic: a responsibility for the other imposed on the subject, which consciousness is always too late to assimilate as a phenomenon (OUJ 232).<br>

Since historical distance tends to present a somewhat abstracted and idealized picture of medieval warfare, the differences may loom as even more distinctive, with an image of knights in armor colliding on the field of battle contrasted to various models of contemporary warfare: ethnically or<br>

  Kant’s Conception of Logic from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon in introductory philosophy courses to receive a picture of Kant that paints him as a paradigmatic old-fashioned, detached Prussian scholar, whose walks were so predictable that the residents of Königsberg could set their clocks by them, and whose life passed as the most regular of regular verbs. Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic. There we find obscure arguments couched in arcane, inscrutable terminology, as well as intricate, elaborate proofs of synthetic a priori concepts and principles. All<br>

  Abstract: In the old regime’s society, the commonest means of communication between subjects and their sovereign was the petition.

Petitions

  Book Title: Christianity in Evolution-An Exploration<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): MAHONEY JACK<br>
  Abstract: Evolution has provided a new understanding of reality, with revolutionary consequences for Christianity. In an evolutionary perspective the incarnation involved God entering the evolving human species to help it imitate the trinitarian altruism in whose image it was created and counter its tendency to self-absorption. Primarily, however, the evolutionary achievement of Jesus was to confront and overcome death in an act of cosmic significance, ushering humanity into the culminating stage of its evolutionary destiny, the full sharing of God's inner life. Previously such doctrines as original sin, the fall, sacrifice, and atonement stemmed from viewing death as the penalty for sin and are shown not only to have serious difficulties in themselves, but also to emerge from a Jewish culture preoccupied with sin and sacrifice that could not otherwise account for death. The death of Jesus on the cross is now seen as saving humanity, not from sin, but from individual extinction and meaninglessness. Death is now seen as a normal process that affect all living things and the religious doctrines connected with explaining it in humans are no longer required or justified. Similar evolutionary implications are explored affecting other subjects of Christian belief, including the Church, the Eucharist, priesthood, and moral behavior.<br>

If the analysis of these extremely popular, very big budget entertainment films, produced in the heart of new intermediality, can be based mainly on questions of intertextuality,¹ it can also, far from any definitive definition, be fuelled by a rich and complex network of notions which carries along in its modern rush the term of attraction.<br>

In this international best-seller, a group of acclaimed thinkers – including Orlando Patterson, S. N. Eisenstadt, Mark Mazower and Wolfgang Schluchter – examine the most important innovations and culturally vital value traditions of Europe to produce an image of contemporary European self-understanding. The volume combines two possible approaches, examining both specific cultural traditions (‘Athens and Jerusalem’) and specific values (‘freedom’; ‘rationality’).

  Abstract: Thresholds of Meaning examines contemporary French narrative and explores two related issues: the centrality within recent French fiction and autofiction of the themes of passage, ritual and liminality; and the thematic continuity which links this work with its literary ancestors of the 1960s and 1970s. Through the close analysis of novels and récits by Pierre Bergounioux, François Bon, Marie Darrieussecq, Hélène Lenoir, Laurent Mauvignier and Jean Rouaud, Duffy demonstrates the ways in which contemporary narrative, while capitalising on the formal lessons of the nouveau roman and drawing upon a shared repertoire of motifs and themes, engages with the complex processes by which meaning is produced in the referential world and, in particular, with the rituals and codes that social man brings into play in order to negotiate the various stages of the human life-cycle. By the application of concepts and models derived from ritual theory and from visual analysis, Thresholds of Meaning situates itself at the intersection of the developing field of literature and anthropology studies and research into word and image.<br>

  Abstract: Tolstoy’s authorial personality, even in the antipoetic guise quoted above, was the fruit of much thought and creative imagination. He considered how his fiction created a public perception of him, and realized that perception would affect how people read his fiction. A work of literature invariably presents some kind of image of the author to the reader, and publication is an opportunity for authors to shape and manage their presentation of a self. What kind of self does Tolstoy craft for his reader? Neither an entirely accessible, unmediated essence (an ideal of the diary), nor an opaque and impersonal source<br>

  Abstract: The question of whether there is such a thing as samurai philosophy, and if so, what it might consist of, is one of the more complex issues in Japanese intellectual history. This is primarily due to developments that occurred during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and which are still inextricably linked to current discussions of the question. From the 1890s onward, a romanticized image of the samurai emerged, motivated by cultural and political currents at the time. The major lasting effect of this idealization was the idea that “warrior thought” represented an independent and relatively homogeneous intellectual tradition<br>

  Book Title: The Phantom Heroine-Ghosts and Gender in Seventeenth-Century Chinese Literature<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): ZEITLIN JUDITH T.<br>
  Abstract: The "phantom heroine"—in particular the fantasy of her resurrection through sex with a living man—is one of the most striking features of traditional Chinese literature. Even today the hypersexual female ghost continues to be a source of fascination in East Asian media, much like the sexually predatory vampire in American and European movies, TV, and novels. But while vampires can be of either gender, erotic Chinese ghosts are almost exclusively female. The significance of this gender asymmetry in Chinese literary history is the subject of Judith Zeitlin’s elegantly written and meticulously researched new book. Zeitlin’s study centers on the seventeenth century, one of the most interesting and creative periods of Chinese literature and politically one of the most traumatic, witnessing the overthrow of the Ming, the Manchu conquest, and the subsequent founding of the Qing. Drawing on fiction, drama, poetry, medical cases, and visual culture, the author departs from more traditional literary studies, which tend to focus on a single genre or author. Ranging widely across disciplines, she integrates detailed analyses of great literary works with insights drawn from the history of medicine, art history, comparative literature, anthropology, religion, and performance studies. The Phantom Heroine probes the complex literary and cultural roots of the Chinese ghost tradition. Zeitlin is the first to address its most remarkable feature: the phenomenon of verse attributed to phantom writers—that is, authors actually reputed to be spirits of the deceased. She also makes the case for the importance of lyric poetry in developing a ghostly aesthetics and image code. Most strikingly, Zeitlin shows that the representation of female ghosts, far from being a marginal preoccupation, expresses cultural concerns of central importance.<br>

The novel’s form and content, the wild proliferation of unpredictable characters, and what was perceived as a deep-seated pessimism were all difficult to reconcile with the image of Arguedas as a major cultural icon of progressive Peruvian culture.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80g9h">Violence and the Female Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: In a typically clever and topical tone, a 2002 cartoon in
                  The New Yorkerdepicts a man and a woman at a table in a restaurant. “You seem different, yet somehow familiar,” says the man. “Are you perhaps Canadian?” In one image and a few words, the cartoonist captures the general attitude of Americans toward Canadians, English Canadians, at least. Cultural, national, ethnic, racial, and gendered stereotypes abound throughout the world, of course, but in the case of Canada – especially English-speaking Canada – and the United States, essentialist images flare up in the preconceived ideas of the “average” citizen, in the<br>

  Abstract: Strangers have become the subjects and objects of intense social, cultural, and political exclusion. We need only recall the discontents of a stranger who is refused entry at a state border, or an exiled subject, a native denied cultural membership, a “foreigner” excluded from public service. These strangers, or marginal others, appear everywhere. It is not their image that is at stake here but, rather, the effect that this otherness implies in the development of specific social practices.<br>

The frequency with which Heidegger and more especially this questionable image of genuine building and dwelling have been invoked by recent architectural theorizing, calls for such an examination.<br>

  Author(s) Wilson-Reitz Megan T.<br>
  Abstract: Hunger and famine were powerful images to the people of the ancient Near East. In Palestine, an abundant harvest depended on an adequate water surplus. On a land that experienced frequent droughts, hunger and famine meant suffering and loss of life. According to the biblical text, hunger stalked Abraham (Gen. 12:10), Isaac (26:1), Joseph (41:27, 54), David (2 Sam. 21:1), Elijah (1 Kgs. 18:2), and Elisha (2 Kgs. 4:38; 8:1). We also learned that Israel experienced physical hunger in the wilderness (Exod. 16:3) and that hunger was a prominent image in Hebrew poetry (Ps. 107:5, 9, 26; Neh. 9:1). This<br>

  Abstract: As in all countries which were occupied by Germany during the Second World War, the German Occupation in Norway was met by resistance. This resistance was not only carried out by organized military groups but also by parts of the civilian population. Though it took very different forms and developed in different ways, resistance became an elementary component in the national self-image of Norway after 1945. Memory of the resistance in the post-war period was mostly shaped by the circulation of popular stories about ‘resistance heroes’ and their actions – such as in the extensive ‘experience’ literature.

Firstly, coming to fame when she did, Sagan was a very early arrival in the postwar firmament of stars, predating Bardot and Hallyday, for example. Secondly, she was truly an icon, in that she was extensively photographed and her image was widely diffused in what, practically speaking, was a pretelevisual age.¹<br>

  Author(s) Geyer Michael<br>
  Abstract: Ideas of European integration are mostly shaped by the image of an increasing merger of distinct states. In this process differences are dissolved to be finally subsumed into one coherent social and political space with one homogenous public sphere inhabited by actors who perceive each other as similar. This idea derives from the common experience of the nation- building process and its homogenizing effects since the nineteenth century: diverse societies built a common new form, where differences were largely extinguished. This perspective has not remained unchallenged: disapproving skeptics highlight the value of European plurality, which should not be pressed into<br>

  Abstract: That socialism is Utopia is quite obvious. It is so for very realistic reasons -because it does not want to abandon the collective future to the interplay of blind forces or interests; because there is no other way in which a society can gain some little ascendancy over its situation than by projecting itself into a full and solid image of its future. Thus political choices are not dependent only on disparate sets of circumstances and surface compromises, but also find coherence and perspective in more clearly fixed alternatives.<br>

Philosophy’s metamorphosis into an incomplete critical discourse that resists the ‘spectral and mortuary cosmos’ of total reproduction¹ both enhanced and questioned her public image. Progressively, she realised that the public intellectual is pinned to a scene of utterance that produces assenting crowds, and therefore is thrown into question. The second part of this chapter<br>

  Abstract: In the two books he wrote on the cinematic image, Gilles Deleuze proposes a fundamental break in the history of film form. This break occurred, he declares, sometime around the end of the Second World War and finds its first expression in the work of Italian neorealist film-makers such as Roberto Rossellini. In Rossellini’s images of aimless characters wandering through the ruins of a bombed-out Europe, Deleuze uncovers a decisive rupture with the logic of classical cinema, a rejection of the possibility for action upon which classical narrative depends.

Poems make the language in which they are made appear contingent, and necessary, at once: they make their writers and readers feel a justness or truth in the poem’s language, at the same time as making those writers and readers question just how that part of the poem’s language (a rhyme, an image, the weight on a syllable, and so on) could produce the reactions it produces. The language in poems seems<br>

  Author(s) Deegan Marilyn<br>
  Abstract: What is ethnography? Is it relevant to English studies? And, if so, how? This chapter is concerned with these questions. In academia, ethnography as a research methodology is typically associated with the social sciences, most usually, although not exclusively, with the discipline of anthropology. It is chiefly a qualitative research strategy that relies primarily on participant observation and concerns itself in its most general sense with the study and interpretation of cultural behaviour. The conventional image of the ethnographer is the academic who goes out into the field (traditionally a distant land of whose people and way of life little<br>

  Abstract: Sartre radically displaces the centred self and begins to reconfigure the Outside/Other through his fleshism. This is advanced by Merleau-Ponty, who in reaching for the
                  Lebensweltas a means to bypass the crisis of modern thought, ultimately provides the conceptual notion of the fold. The fold, in turn, allows us to overcome some of the more ambiguous elements in Sartre’s thought, particularly insofar as his retention of a dualistic vernacular evokes a problematic image of transcendence and therefore remains trapped in this crisis. The remaining issue with Merleau-Ponty concerns his lack of a worked-out conception of force, particularly within a<br>

  Abstract: The idea of silent Shakespeare strikes many as oxymoronic. In its muting of Shakespearean drama, silent Shakespearean cinema robs its inherited source of that which most frequently, and perhaps most crucially, has been taken to define it. In effect, the collaboration of this dramatic material with this medium of expression can be read as a liaison of naturally antithetical forces: one imaginatively evokes the image through the suggestive power of the poetically employed word, the other does not just erode the power of the word in its privileging of the image, but all but ousts words from its performance space.<br>

Just compare the amount of scholarly texts on television to radio, on cinema and gaming rather than soundtracks and soundscapes. Even the mobile phone, which is essentially a listening device, has only become interesting to media studies since it has a screen interface of applications, games, graphics, e-mail, photos and videos.

  Abstract: In the Akwapim kingdom of southeastern Ghana,¹ clothing is used as a form of communication to make statements about personhood and status; to conceal or reveal identity; to express desires and impulses. It may do so directly or indirectly, conventionally or rebelliously. Clothing is owned, bestowed and gives identity. The clothed body expresses the person of the wearer and society’s image of that person. As a result, clothing absorbs the particular times in which it has been worn² and becomes like a relic of these past events.<br>

  Book Title: Memory and the Moving Image-French Film in the Digital Era<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): McNeill Isabelle<br>
  Abstract: A vital rethinking of memory and the moving image for the digital age, Isabelle McNeill investigates the role of the moving image in cultural memory, considering the impact of digital technologies on visual culture. Drawing on an interdisciplinary range of theoretical resources and an unusual body of films and moving image works, the author examines the ways in which recent French filmmaking conceptualises both the past and the workings of memory. Ultimately the author argues that memory is an intersubjective process, in which filmic forms continue to play a crucial role even as new media come to dominate our contemporary experience.Memory and the Moving Image:*Introduces new ways of thinking about the relation between film and memory, arising from a compelling, interdisciplinary study of theories and films*Subtly explores the French context while drawing theoretical conclusions with wider implications and applicability*Provides detailed and illuminating close readings of varied moving image works to aid theoretical explorations*Moves away from auteurist approaches, examining work by canonical directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker and Agnès Varda alongside that of less well-known filmmakers such as Claire Simon and Yamina Benguigui*Brings together thinkers such as Bergson, Deleuze, Bazin and Barthes with, for example, Rodowick and Mulvey, in an engaging interweaving of theories.Works considered include Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du Cinéma (1989-98), Yamina Benguigui's Mémoires d'Immigrés (1997), Chris Marker's CD-ROM Immemory (1998), Claire Simon's Mimi (2003), Michael Haneke's Caché (2005) and Agnès Varda's multi-media exhibition, L'Île et Elle (2006).<br>

  Abstract: In his exploratory analysis of the subjective experience of remembering films, Victor Burgin remarks that, ‘in a scene equally available to us all, that means the same to us all, there is an opening onto a destination towards which only one of us will be drawn’ (2004: 65). I believe Burgin is right to emphasise film’s ability to create an intimate connection with the spectator, in which filmic signs bond with fragments of personal memory in unpredictable and potentially unique ways. Burgin gives the term ‘sequence-image’ to the fragment of remembered film and illustrates the concept with a description of<br>

There are many ways in which the early history of the Jesus movie echoes that of the Jesus novel more than a half century earlier, from the new genre’s immediate international scope to the hesitant, incremental advance of its pictorial resources. Over the years of 1897 and 1898 alone, French and American production companies, each working in relative isolation, made about half a dozen known Jesus movies,<br>

  Book Title: Covering Bin Laden-Global Media and the World's Most Wanted Man<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): AL-SUMAIT FAHED<br>
  Abstract: Starting in 2001, much of the world media used the image of Osama bin Laden as a shorthand for terrorism. Bin Laden himself considered media manipulation on a par with military, political, and ideological tools, and intentionally used interviews, taped speeches, and distributed statements to further al-Qaida's ends. In Covering Bin Laden , editors Susan Jeffords and Fahed Yahya Al-Sumait collect perspectives from global scholars exploring a startling premise: that media depictions of Bin Laden not only diverge but often contradict each other, depending on the media provider and format, the place in which the depiction is presented, and the viewer's political and cultural background. The contributors analyze the representations of the many Bin Ladens, ranging from Al Jazeera broadcasts to video games. They examine the media's dominant role in shaping our understanding of terrorists and why/how they should be feared, and they engage with the ways the mosaic of Bin Laden images and narratives have influenced policies and actions around the world. Contributors include Fahed Al-Sumait, Saranaz Barforoush, Aditi Bhatia, Purnima Bose, Ryan Croken, Simon Ferrari, Andrew Hill, Richard Jackson, Susan Jeffords, Joanna Margueritte-Giecewicz, Noha Mellor, Susan Moeller, Brigitte Nacos, Courtney C.

To adopt the correspondence model of truth, for instance, is to act as if human capacities for cognition can be brought into close correspondence with the way of the world separate from those capacities. Nietzsche would say that such a realism preserves the remains of an old theology.¹ Its operational assumption, first, that the world

  Abstract: In the previous chapter, I tried to show that Modernism in Western literature—and in the New Critical and structuralist hermeneutics to which it gave rise—is grounded in a representational strategy that spatializes the temporal process of existence as being-in-the-world. It is, in other words, a strategy that is subject to a vicious circularity that closes off the phenomenological/existential understanding of the temporal being of existence, and analogously, of the literary text: the sequence of words. It is no accident that the autotelic and in-clusive circle—the circle, that is, as image or figure, or, as I prefer, as<br>

  Abstract: Finding the theoretical space where cinema and philosophy meet, Malin Wahlberg’s sophisticated approach to the experience of documentary film aligns with attempts to reconsider the premises of existential phenomenology. Wahlberg discusses a corpus of classical and recent experiments in film and video in which creative approaches to the time of the image and the potential archive memory of filmic representation illuminates meanings of temporality and time experience.<br>

  Abstract: For André Bazin, as for Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Roland Barthes, the trace is always a trace

With reference toCamera LucidaI stressed the semiotic dimension of Barthes’s photo-trace, that is, the importance of extratextual knowledge, the animation through which the image may turn into a trace of the past. Aside from the possibility of novels and film narratives to thematically and symbolically explore the relations between history, memory, and imagination, narration in moving pictures has the means to explore the temporal and mnemonic contingency of photographs,<br>

The two are distinct to such an extent that they demand different forms of description: one should never employ the term “is” when talking about the temporal world in which everything becomes, just as one should never use “was” or “will be” when speaking of eternity in which nothing changes. Careless deployment of verb tense, according to Plato, leads to blurring the absolute nature of the distinction. Yet Plato nonetheless envisions a relationship between eternity and time in which time is “a moving image of eternity.”¹ Eternity<br>

Then, as now, research in architecture required frequent cross-disciplinary visits. Such visitors must be ruthless in taking advantage of the host discipline, and ruthless again with themselves to avoid what anthropologists call “going native.” In this, they fit the classic image of the architect as using knowledge from many other disciplines without becoming an expert in any of them (Vitruvius 1960 , 5—11 ).<br>

By placing human subjects under the never-ending surveillance of cameras, and by labeling the resulting spectacle reality, these shows seem to have been conceived for the specific purpose of implementing Foucault’s dystopic vision of a panoptic society, and Baudrillard’s doctrine of the (hyper) reality of the image in contemporary culture.

Yet hidden within this melancholic tradition are the resources for a renewed challenge to prevailing regimes of historicity, a passion that has the power to reignite the dialectic of revolutionary thought.<br>

  Book Title: Sanctioning Modernism-Architecture and the Making of Postwar Identities<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Steiner Frederick<br>
  Abstract: In the decades following World War II, modern architecture spread around the globe alongside increased modernization, urbanization, and postwar reconstruction—and it eventually won widespread acceptance. But as the limitations of conventional conceptions of modernism became apparent, modern architecture has come under increasing criticism. In this collection of essays, experienced and emerging scholars take a fresh look at postwar modern architecture by asking what it meant to be "modern," what role modern architecture played in constructing modern identities, and who sanctioned (or was sanctioned by) modernism in architecture.This volume presents focused case studies of modern architecture in three realms—political, religious, and domestic—that address our very essence as human beings. Several essays explore developments in Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia and document a modernist design culture that crossed political barriers, such as the Iron Curtain, more readily than previously imagined. Other essays investigate various efforts to reconcile the concerns of modernist architects with the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian institutions. And a final group of essays looks at postwar homebuilding in the United States and demonstrates how malleable and contested the image of the American home was in the mid-twentieth century. These inquiries show the limits of canonical views of modern architecture and reveal instead how civic institutions, ecclesiastical traditions, individual consumers, and others sought to sanction the forms and ideas of modern architecture in the service of their respective claims or desires to be modern.<br>

  Abstract: While the nondiscursive, frequently digressive character of the

By drawing on Warburg's published and unpublished writings and by attending to Warburg's cardinal idea that "pathos formulas" structure the West's cultural memory, Johnson maps numerous tensions between word and image in theMnemosyne-Atlas. In addition to examining the work itself, he considers the literary, philosophical, and intellectual-historical implications of theMnemosyne-Atlas. As Johnson demonstrates, theMnemosyne-Atlasis not simply the culmination of Warburg's lifelong study of Renaissance culture but the ultimate expression of his now literal, now metaphoric search for syncretic solutions to the urgent problems posed by the history of art and culture.<br>

  Book Title: A Companion to the Works of Johann Gottfried Herder-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Koepke Wulf<br>
  Abstract: Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) is one of the great names of the classical age of German literature. One of the last universalists, he wrote on aesthetics, literary history and theory, historiography, anthropology, psychology, education, and theology; translated and adapted poetry from ancient Greek, English, Italian, even from Persian and Arabic; collected folk songs from around the world; and pioneered a better understanding of non-European cultures. A student of Kant's, he became Goethe's mentor in Strasbourg, and was a mastermind of the Sturm und Drang and a luminary of classical Weimar. But the wide range of Herder's interests and writings, along with his unorthodox ways of seeing things, seems to have prevented him being fully appreciated for any of them. His image has also been clouded by association with political ideologies, the proponents of which ignored the message of Humanität in his texts. So although Herder is acknowledged by scholars to be one of the great thinkers of European Enlightenment, there is no up-to-date, comprehensive introduction to his works in English, a lacuna this book fills with seventeen new, specially commissioned essays.

  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

The oeuvre of this graduate of the Deutsche Film und Fernsehakademie (German Film and Television Academy Berlin; dffb) is characterized by a technique of repurposing moving-image archives in a critical documentary mode crafted to reveal the hidden processes of preparation, acculturation, and training that pervasively constitute the present-day West and render its citizens unwittingly yet habitually complicit.

  Abstract: Kafka is remarkable, above all, for the visual density of his writing, a visual prowess that can be linked to his self-image as an “eye-person” (Augenmensch).¹ His extraordinary literary imagination generates an imagery that startles and challenges the reader who expects the recognizable. Kafka’s intent, it has been said, is “to make strange the familiar.”² Like his much admired model, Gustave Flaubert, he radically changed the fictional worlds that European realism had mapped out.³ The transformative power of his writing, however, unlike Flaubert’s, arises from the stark, suggestive force of his images: the resulting dynamics of puzzlement and shock reveal<br>

  Book Title: Narratives of Identity in Alban Berg's "Lulu"-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): dos Santos Silvio J.<br>
  Abstract: Exploring the crossroads between autobiographical narrative and musical composition, this book examines Berg's transformation of Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist (1895) and Die Büchse der Pandora/ (1904) -- the plays used in the formation of the libretto for Lulu -- according to notions of gender identity, social customs, and the aesthetics of modernity in Vienna of the 1920s and 1930s. While Berg modernized several aspects of the plays by Wedekind and incorporated serial techniques of composition from Arnold Schoenberg, he never let go of the idealistic Wagnerian perspectives of his youth. In fact, he went as far as reconfiguring aspects of Richard Wagner's life as an ideal identity to be played out in the compositional process. In the process of composing the opera, Berg also reflected on the most important cultural figures in fin-de-siècle Vienna that affected his worldview, including Karl Kraus, Emil Lucka, Otto Weininger, and others. Adopting an approach that combines a systematic analysis of Berg's numerous sketches for Lulu, correspondence, and the finished work with interpretive models drawn from cultural studies and philosophy, this book elucidates the ways in which Berg grappled with his self-image as an "incorrigible romantic" (unverbesserliche Romantiker) at the end of his life, explaining aspects of his musical language that have been considered strange or anomalous in the scholarship.

  Abstract: This essay traces the evolution of the views on the communist takeover in Bulgaria (September 9, 1944), the “people’s democracy” (1944–1948), and socialism for the duration of the regime and after its fall. The communist regime shaped and strictly controlled knowledge about itself, its genesis, and its past. The regime’s ideologically distorted self-image is of interest to historiography as an extreme case in which historical knowledge is subject to direct politicization and ideologization in legitimating power. At first sight, notions about the past would seem to be fixed once and for all. But precisely because knowledge of the past<br>

  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Abstract: The book reads as an enthusiastic defense of science being a value‐free enterprise, a thesis depending upon a difference in kind between epistemic values and other ethical values. Lacey’s approach is quite abstract and it is not clear what disciplines are included under the rubric of “science” and it is questionable whether all sciences are amenable to his analysis. Lacey concentrates on one aspect of scientific practice, theory acceptance, but scientific activity arguably is more than that and even a successful argument here calls up the image of plugging a leaking dike with one’s finger. Lacey’s richest chapter is the penultimate where he revises his position on scientific objectivity, neutrality, and autonomy but his interesting conclusion on the envalued nature of science is confined to a brief discussion in his short concluding chapter. He will perhaps furnish a more rewarding exploration of that subject in the future.<br>

Abstract: Second, we would ask where he assumes it is
         appropriate to speakabout his interpretation. Does he assume that it is somehow his duty to talk about his interpretation of the news or that it is impolite to entertain that kind of conversation, or that talk does not matter? Finally, we would askwhat image of the wider world, and his relation to it, does he have in mind when offering his interpretation of the news? Studies of resistance (Hall1973; Morley1980; Scott1990; Lancaster1988; Willis 1981; Kelley1996) describe long‐standing communities resisting clear, structural domination: Working‐class listeners relating to mainstream news, peasants or slaves relating to official pronunciamentos, or African‐American or working‐class students relating to white, middle‐class teachers. But not all modes of interpreting dominant culture are only either “resisting” or “complying with” elites or powerful institutions; they do not just say “yes” or “no,” but articulate whole new meanings. Second, resistance studies show situations in which members actively perceive oppression as coming directly from an employer, schoolteacher, or political ruler who is immediately present or to whom members can speak directly. But our studies show situations in which the source of oppression is not very clear to members. Oppression may be coming from diffuse sources, in which there is no clearly embodied oppressor against whom to rebel (Hayward2000).<br>

Abstract: I suggest that this revival has been possible partly because of linguistic anthropologists ability to project an image of themselves as empirically oriented fieldworkers who have more important things to do than argue with one another (or with those in other subfields). Furthermore, researchers have had no difficulty moving back and forth from one paradigm to another without confronting (or being confronted by others regarding) their own epistemological, ontological, and methodological wavering. In addition to the differences already outlined. I will here briefly mention some other areas of incompatibility or lack of agreement across paradigms.<br>

Abstract: The notion of seeing the normally unseen is, however, extremely ambiguous precisely because when I began to think along these lines, Hawking was unapproachable.
         8Based on articles and interviews, my reconstruction of the network of humans and machines surrounding him was as much of a reconstruction as any other article. Moreover, I was left with the strange feeling that the more I worked with written representations and images of Hawking, the more I had a stable image of who he was—a man with a relatively well‐defined ego.9Yet the closer I came to the scientist’s body, the greater access I had to what I call his distributed or extended body (his secretary, his computer, and his students), but not to him, because he refused all my attempts to meet with him. Finally, when I read accounts of people who had met him, they typically reported that they were unable to tell whether they were dealing with a Hawking who was suffering, bored, or thinking. In short, the closer I was to the single body, the more I discovered a multiplicity of Hawkings, while the more I turned my focus to the multiplicity of constructions and representations of Hawking in the media, the more I could see a stable ego appear. My first investigation concerning Hawking’s identity thus ended with the perhaps inevitable question: Where are you, then, Professor Hawking?<br>

Abstract: For a long line of Whig historians the revolution and civil war of the 1630s and 1640s was the particular responsibility of the Stuarts, who in significant ways broke with the constitutional precedents established by the Tudors. Elizabeth especially was conventionally represented as a defender of English liberties and Protestantism. Neal counters this narrative and shows that the arbitrary principles of Charles and his father followed directly from the example of Elizabeth: “She had high notions of the sovereign authority of Princes, and of her own absolute Supremacy in Church Affairs: and being of Opinion that Methods of Severity were lawful to bring her Subjects to an outward Uniformity, she countenanced all the Engines of Persecution, such as Spiritual Courts, High Commission, and Star‐Chamber, and stretched her prerogative to support them beyond the Laws, and against the Sense of the Nation.”
      30Neal detailed actions on the part of the queen that, he pointedly remarks, “cost one of her Successors his Crown and Life.”31It was Elizabeth’s active persecution of the Puritans that began the divisions that were to culminate on a scaffold outside Inigo Jones’s Banquetting House on Whitehall in 1649. As Neal put it, in an image that Hume was later to appropriate into hisHistory of England, “The breach might easily have been made up at first, but it widened by degrees; the passions of the contending parties increased, till the fire, which for some years was burning under ground, broke out into a civil war, and with unspeakable fury destroyed the Constitution both of Church and State.”32<br>

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”

Abstract: Similarly, the haunting image of the schoolteacher Daru, who is
         l’hôte—the simultaneous “guest/host”—in Camus’s Algerian short story in his 1957 collectionL’exil et le royaume,contrasts sharply with what Braudel remembered as the innocence of colonial Algeria thirty years before.120After freeing the Arab prisoner to allow him to choose his own destiny, Daru returns alone to his classroom. One can see the colonial classroom, the maps and chalkboard tools of the teacher, the Algerian landscape of sky and plateau and “the invisible lands stretching all the way to the sea” focusing our gaze on what it really means to be alone and an exile. The last paragraph of Camus’s story is as biting for us today as it was for France in 1957, the year that Camus received the Nobel Prize in Literature121and that the French scored their Pyrrhic victory crushing terrorism in the “Battle of Algiers.”122“A little later, standing before the window of the classroom, the schoolmaster was watching the clear light bathing the whole surface of the plateau, but he hardly saw it. Behind him on the blackboard, among the winding French rivers, sprawled the clumsily chalked‐up words he had just read: ‘You handed over our brother. You will pay for this.’ Daru looked at the sky, the plateau, and, beyond, the invisible lands stretching all the way to the sea. In this last landscape he had loved so much, he was alone.”123Have the lessons of the schoolmaster in geography and politics been learned? Whose landscape and whose politics was or is it?<br>

Abstract: Meyers is not so naive as to hold that careful screening and imaginative trope play will automatically yield a liberatory model of individual agency. She insists that the self‐figurations that “survive this vetting must become embedded in the cognitive, emotional, and corporeal structures that shape agency and that function as criteria of self‐appraisal. To agentically integrate dissident self‐figurations, women must command skills that enable them to invest emotionally in these tropes and to reconfigure their embodied values as well as their patterns of thought and volition in accordance with them” (55). How? Partly through changes in child‐rearing practices and the social order more generally, but Meyers’s view presumes that the skills for emotional investment and revision of values and volition are already available to most women. However, it can be argued that many women lack these skills and find it arduous to embed new figurations in their cognitive, emotional, and corporeal selves. It is hard to see how any amount of screening and play will take us from image to agency. A more productive approach would be to focus on developing those skills (including through changes in the social order), but that option is constrained in part by the predominance of the very imagery of which Meyers is critical. She uses commanding language in her argument for experimentation with new subjectivities—women
      mustscreen,mustviscerally imagine,mustembed new self‐images,mustcommand skills. This makes it easy to miss her recognition of the insufficiency of such measures, as does the relative lack of detailed proposals for restructuring the social order. Yet one cannot simply flout the power of cultural images in women’s lives. By exposing the feedback loop between self‐image and agentic skills in a patriarchal order, Meyers establishes that image and agency are not two distinct paths. Her emphasis may be on imagery, but it is clear that image and large‐scale political change mu~<br>

Abstract: I point to the similarities between Haraway’s cyborg theory and theories of several other poststructuralists in order to suggest that there is nothing inherently subversive for feminism about such theorizing unless the theory can be shown to have specific, material, and located ramifications (a fact Haraway seems to have partially recognized in
         Modest_Witness[1997a], which I will briefly discuss at the end of this essay). Indeed, as Susan Bordo suggests, the epistemologicaljouissancesuggested by the image of the cyborg denies locatedness and fantasizes itself as a postmodern “dream of everywhere” (1990, 136, 144–45).10Here it is important to distinguish betweenlocatednessand a simple celebration of thelocalas endless possibility. I am not advocating what Manuel Castells (1997) describes as a defensive and retrenched localism (manifested most disturbingly in the “not in my backyard” ideal) in the face of globalization as a basis for feminist identity but rather a relationship to materiality and sociopolitical specificity as a basis for theorizing, much in the manner of Castells’s own analyses (1997, 61–62). In arguing for a relationship to locatedness, I am taking a stance about critical responsibility in a postcolonial world. As third‐world environmentalists such as Vandana Shiva (1997) and subaltern studies historians have demonstrated, policies and political concepts of postcolonial nations cannot be understood through universal (read: Western) concepts alone, even though local concepts need to be related to the global. Witness Shiva’s call for international legal ecological policies based on an understanding of indigenous knowledges and Partha Chatterjee’s (1986) critique of the Western idea of nation as inapplicable to postcolonial countries. In the United States, critical race theorists have argued for what legal theorist Richard Delgado (1995) terms thecall to context, which challenges the traditional juridical preference for universalism over particu~<br>

Eco invokes the famous example given by Abelard—“nulla rosa est” (there is no rose, such a thing as a rose never existed)—that actually brings to mind the image of a rose. He also brings in the dialectic of contiguity and similarity, according to which “if objectxhas been in some way imagined to be in contact with objecty,or if objectxpresents any sort of homology with objecty,every time objectxis evoked, objectywill be as well” (254).<br>

Abstract: A more adequate interpretation of social responsibility may be developed also by bringing a childist perspective on children’s experiences to the Bible. For example, the very first command from God to humanity is the Gen. 1:28 injunction to “be fruitful and multiply.” As having just been created “in the image of God,” humanity is asked to understand itself somewhat like its own Creator as, primordially, a generative, reproductive, creative being. Most obviously this command implies reproduction of a biological kind, making it inherently related to children. But it can also suggest—as thinkers like Henri Bergson, Martin Buber, Gustavo Gutiérrez, Philip Hefner, and Elizabeth Johnson have variously shown—a broader responsibility for
         socialreproduction, so that responsibility for offspring offers a symbol or model for human responsibility overall.50Responding to children’s poverty, for example, can be placed in the light of a broader human responsibility for social reproduction. Just as God created the world, so also is humanity as God’s image obliged to create or cocreate its own social world ever anew, on a paradigm of parental and social fruitfulness and multiplication through care, love, and nurturance of the next generation.<br>

Abstract: The creative moral capability is ultimately best imagined through the strange language of myth. Myth can simultaneously capture the narrative thickness of actual social dynamics yet also press it toward its own more primordial creative possibilities. Myth arises out of and subjects to critique particular historical conditions. Moral creativity is more concretely imagined the more its mythologization—as, for example, in McFague’s all‐embracing Motherhood—disrupts and transforms present history in a freshly inclusive way. The symbolism of a kingdom of God, by contrast, may now imply such hierarchical social domination that it can no longer function well as a symbol of the hoped‐for new human community. Gustavo Gutiérrez offers still another possibility of the symbolism of “creative freedom” through “work”: “Humankind is created in the image and likeness of God and … fulfills itself only by transforming nature and thus entering into relationships with other persons. Only in this way do persons come to a full consciousness of themselves as subjects of creative freedom which is realized through work.”
         38In whatever form, such moral myths are themselves on some level all‐too‐human creations. Even the myth of the Creator Mother can transform human society only so far. Nevertheless, the value of myth for moral practice and thought lies precisely in its capacity for opening and transforming moral life. It can provoke our easily lost yet always also available faculty for creating together a more profoundly humanized social world.<br>

Abstract: The presentism implicit in the modernist program proposed a progressive devaluation of the past and all that came before it to guarantee a definitive separation from the present’s antecedents. Similarly, it is important to recognize in this modernist project the ideological desire to conceal and displace the very historical unevenness marking its present; at any rate, that unevenness, it was believed, would eventually be eliminated. The early decades of the century, and especially the interwar conjuncture, were crowded with manifestoes arrayed against the past (its slowness) in the name of the immediacy of art and life, often summoning the instant, the sudden, and the simultaneous to attest to the temporality of the present. Whereas these declarations reflected artistic and literary impulses, all inflecting modernism itself, they nevertheless managed to match more substantial and materialized intimations associated with capital, which thinkers like Simmel had already described as portents of an endless present. There is, in any case, a good deal of evidence to authorize the image of a temporal dominant of the present already weighted with the future and the rejection of the past. Paul Valéry, despite his harsh dismissal of history, found it necessary to propose a mode of relating between past and present such that the former would no longer pretend to offer the latter lessons. Sartre, still as a novelist, acknowledged that there was only the “present, and nothing other than the present.” After the war, in the first issue of
         Les Temps modernes,he advised that writing for contemporaries meant looking at the worldnotthrough the optic of the future but with the “eyes of flesh,” “with our true, perishable eyes” (quoted inRH,pp. 123, 124). During the early months of the war in the Pacific, Japanese writers and scholars met to discuss the meaning of the conflict for the overcoming of the modern, Westernized present by something distinctly Japanese, while philosoph~<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Abstract: This was not just a sly turn but a full boomerang effect—along a slow arc, building momentum as it goes. After all those years expended in the feverish penning of an already smudged-out life, the heroine learns to her horror, the first hint dropped in a garbled remark by Flintwinch one besotted midnight, that it has all been for nought. She quickly teases out of him that her words were never in fact posted at all. They were shown to his twin brother instead (these circuitous details still from the novel itself), secreted away in a locked box by that infernal mirror image of her jailor, and then somehow returned to “her” Flintwinch for sequestering. And more maddening yet—here's the new twist, leaving the source text far behind—she learns that they had been lately sold for a song (a drinking song at that) to a respected gentleman who made up part of a large party one evening at the local alehouse and who, having heard the merest gist of her grief, wanted the whole chest of letters shipped to London. She learns, too, that this gentleman trafficker in recorded lives happens to be the famous novelist Boz, in town for some public appearance. Flintwinch had somehow horned in on the long round of toasts and grown talkative with the famous man, who let him know just the use he was hoping to make of these letters. Ephraim was assured on the novelist's departure that, if that poor unfortunate's tale is half as strong as he makes it sound, the good chap might look for the story of his mad female charge in a serialized fiction a year or so later—under assumed names all round of course (the novelist winked) and backdated (the latest fad) into the recent past. Looking for a big finish to a novel he'd been planning, Mr. Boz hoped her crazed tale would turn the trick. And in leaving he raised a glass to her, after ordering Ephraim's filled yet again:

Abstract: I could not understand and made an effort to endure the pain of this contradiction: on the one hand, an existence, a tenderness, surviving in me just as I had known them, that is, made for me; a love in which everything found its own punctual complement, its goal, its constant direction in me. … On the other hand, no sooner had I experienced this happiness again, as if it belonged to the present, than I felt it was obstructed by the certainty, spreading like a recurrent physical pain, of a void which had effaced my image of that tenderness, which had destroyed that existence, abolished retrospectively our mutual predestination, made of my grandmother, at the very moment when I found her again

Abstract: Killing in defense of the common good by public officers acting within the parameters of their official responsibilities is different. Augustine writes, “The natural order which seeks the peace of mankind, ordains that the monarch should have the power of undertaking war if he thinks it advisable, and that the soldiers should perform their military duties in behalf of peace and safety of the community.”
         23He describes acts of justified homicide as “exceptions to the law against killing, made by the authority of God himself.”24In Augustine’s mind, especially during the latter part of his career, political life serves real, objective goods that can be defended in ways that allow for proportionate ordering of loves and commitments.25The public order embodies an image or replication of harmony—less perfect than the ideal, heavenly city but providing a (relatively) good harmony nonetheless. The heavenly city, he writes, “does not hesitate to obey the laws of the earthly city by which those things which are designed for the support of this mortal life are regulated; and the purpose of this obedience is that, since this mortal condition is shared by both cities, a harmony may be preserved between them in things that are relevant to this condition.”26The earthly city serves a relative good, necessary for members of the heavenly city on their pilgrimage to their final destination. Accordingly, persons whose loves are properly ordered may attach relative value to the good that political life is meant to secure. Augustine writes, “[God] has given to mankind certain good things suitable to this life. These are: temporal peace, in proportion to the short span of mortal life—the peace that consists in bodily health and soundness, and in fellowship with one’s kind; and everything necessary to safeguard or recover this peace.”27<br>

Abstract: Here is why. Technological media may generally strive for and promise immediacy,
         66but cinema quickly became—and, at its most interesting, still remains—an object of gaps and absences. From the outset, cinema's remarkable psychological and cultural voltage has been built on delay and slippage. What I have dubbeddécalagelies at the heart of the medium and of each particular film, a gap between here and there as well as now and then.67This French term connotes discrepancy in space and deferral or jumps in time. At the most primary level, the film image leaps from present to past, for what is edited and shown was filmed at least days, weeks, or months earlier. This slight stutter in its articulation then repeats itself in the time and distance that separates filmmaker from spectator and spectators from each other when they see the same film on separate occasions. The gap in each of these relations constitutes cinema's difference from television and new media. Films display traces of what is past and inaccessible, whereas TV and certainly the internet are meant to feel and be present. We live with television as a continual part of our lives and our homes; sets are sold as furniture. Keeping up a twenty‐four‐hour chatter on scores of channels, TV is banal by definition. In contrast, wego outto the movies, leaving home to cross into a different realm. Every genuine cinematic experience involvesdécalage, time‐lag. After all, we are taken on a flight during and after which we are not quite ourselves.<br>

Abstract: The contradictory impulses in the nascent Enlightenment's relationship to Judaism were never clearer than in the case of Spinoza. His devastating engagement with biblical criticism in the
         Theologico-Political Treatise(1670), according to Sutcliffe, “primitivises and infantalises” the Jews of the Old Testament while continuing to regard Scripture as their authentic, if flawed, history. Paradoxically, Spinoza would later undergo a rather different transfiguration as the “Messiah of the Enlightenment.” Sutcliffe examines how, after the philosopher's death in 1677, his biographers made painstaking efforts to “de-judaise” his thought by emphasizing his tranquil “self-mastery” and blithe detachment from any confessional identity. Nevertheless, Spinoza's early affiliation with Judaism left this universalist image fraught with a productive tension: his first biographer, Jean Maximilien Lucas, likened his subject to Christ—another great philosopher who, having rejected the prejudices of his time, set forth to preach the love of God and neighbor. His life and death, furthermore, announced the appearance of a new source of truth for humanity, that of the Enlightenment. Sutcliff seizes on such ambiguities to show how the original paradox at the center of Enlightenment universalism could never fully transcend the particularities of its founder (Sutcliffe, 118–47, quotes on 123, 133). Sutcliffe's Spinoza, even more than Sepinwall's Grégoire, symbolizes an ideal that began to fail at the moment of its inception.<br>

Abstract: This notion of literature develops from Blanchot's reading of Mallarmé as well as his encounter with the Hegelian description of comprehension. Drawing from Kojève's seminars, Blanchot begins with the notion that language involves the absence (the annihilation or death) of the object, such that for one to possess the idea of cat, one must annihilate the uniquely real cat in its existence.
         35“Common language,” Blanchot writes, recognizes this operation as unproblematic or at least productive. For in killing the real cat, I have gained something much more secure, the idea of cat, which cannot die. Literary language differs from common language not in the act itself, for by the very fact that it is language it must also enact a negation of the object. “But literary language,” Blanchot suggests, “is made of uneasiness” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 325). Literary language draws attention back to the negativity of the operation, focusing on the fact that the word expresses the nonexistence of the cat and that what it has given us as a replacement is a word. Literature dramatizes the operation of replacement by offering “an endless sliding of ‘turns of phrase' which do not lead anywhere. Thus is born,” Blanchot writes, “the image that does not designate the thing but, rather, what the thing is not” (“L,” p. 315; “LRD,” p. 326). The mark of the literary is the mark of the trope, a turn. A figure of speech is a turn that multiplies the absence between the object and the word, for now what we have is a word that refers not to the object but to another word.<br>

Abstract: Could there be a movie that is simply about flowers? Perhaps there could be a movie about
         aflower (or at least about a single patch of flowers), depicting the story of its life. But then again, what is the story of a flower? What, to paraphrase Charlie, is a flower's “arc”?6If the phrase makes any sense at all in the present context, it applies to the steady rhythm of anthic life:7seed to bloom, bloom to seed; open at dawn, closed at dusk; an arc of endless simplicity, and the very image, in fact, with whichAdaptationconcludes. For what we see, after Charlie drives away, is a cluster of daisies on the median of the highway. We watch them in time-lapse as they open and close, open and close, to the cheery strains of “Happy Together,” while the human world (in the form of speeding cars) races on behind them in a steady blur (fig. 1).8<br>

Abstract: Clyde Kluckhohn’s account of Navajo witchcraft makes a different kind of statement from a different culture area and a different line of anthropological thinking. My intuition is that Kluckhohn’s book is less referenced as a classic than Evans-Pritchard’s not only because it is less appealing from a literary standpoint but because it is less accessible from the standpoint of discussing rationality, and frankly scarier from the standpoint of evil supernaturalism. Navajo witchcraft comprises “all types of malevolent activities which endeavor to control the outcome of events by supernatural techniques” (
         1944:22). Navajo witches are associated with death and incest; use powder made from human corpses and shoot mystical arrows into a victim; travel by night transformed into were-animals by clothing themselves in an animal skin; meet other witches to perform inverted versions of healing ceremonies; perpetrate sorcery through spells uttered over the victim’s clothing, a fabricated image of the victim, or bodily leavings like hair or fingernails; “pray a person into the ground” body part by body part; and perform love magic by administering hallucinogenic plants, including datura. They become witches “in order to wreak vengeance, in order to gain wealth or simply to injure wantonly—most often motivated by envy” (26), and must kill a close relative as part of their initiation. A witch who was caught could be killed.<br>

Abstract: Satan enters at the mouth, possessing either the heart or the head and “inspiring” the brute with reason and language. Stephen Fallon has noted that Satan’s possession of the serpent provides the poem with a powerful image of Cartesian dualism—an active mind manipulating a purely passive body.
         
               While the narrative interjections support such a reading, the idea of “inspiration” troubles it, making the serpent’s predicament in book 9 oddly similar to Eve’s in book 5. We are left with yet another “undecidable” moment of satanic speech. Whose words are these exactly? Do they belong entirely to Satan, or is there any sense in which the serpent is being original in the act of enunciation?37<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>

Abstract: Finally, there is another (less obvious) aspect of Bonhoeffer’s nonreligious interpretation that may be applied to the threat of “religious commercialism.” While reflecting on the meaning of cult and prayer in religionless Christianity, Bonhoeffer directs our attention toward the “arcane discipline” of the early church. Here lies at least a partial answer to the question: “How the type of faith to live in the ‘world come of age’ might secure its boundaries within the world?”
         
               At first glance, prayer and worship seem to be the epitome of other-worldly religious ritual. However, Bonhoeffer finds them necessary to protect the mysteries of the Christian faith against profanation,163
            
               that is, against sliding into either other-worldliness or inwardness and thus becoming banal and shallow. This can be interpreted in terms of Bonhoeffer’s willingness to prevent the nonreligious interpretation from being flattened into a form of liberal humanism, pure anthropocentrism or some sort of prosocial ethical behavior. Despite the fact that in Christ’s incarnation God makes God’s own self radically available to the world—to the point of abuse, marginalization, and (in our times above all) irrelevance—the church is responsible for preventing the gospel from becoming too available, that is to say, too commercialized, too marketable, too self-evident, too easy to talk about, too amenable to the “evangelistic sales pitch.”164
            
               If being a Christian is not to be reduced to believing in certain metaphysical doctrines and practicing certain religious rituals, the church has to keep its rituals and its doctrines, so to speak, as a secret, as a mystery, and as a gift received through revelation—a gift that should be shared with others in such a way that those who accept it are aware of both the value and the cost of discipleship in Christ. All that the world should see on the outside, while observing Christians, is~<br>

Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Bosola’s figure is only one of the play’s many attempts to make sense out of seemingly senseless cruelty. The same world of suffering that leads to his image of the stars’ tennis match inspires a very different response from Antonio. In conversation with the Duchess, Antonio delivers one of the most notable of the play’s many “wise” statements: “Man (like to
      Cassia) is prov’d best, being bruiz’d” (3.5.71). In a precursor to Bradley’s meditations on the fragrance of a crushed flower, Antonio also responds to tragic events with an argument that our best selves are revealed through suffering, making pain a valuable experience and tragedy a process of identity formation. Antonio’s perspective, like Bradley’s, grows out of confrontation with a tragic world that appears destined to crush its inhabitants and through associations that find value in that process. But just as the play casts doubt on the ability of the senses to perceive reality, it also questions the capacity of metaphor to make sense of suffering. Webster’s strongest character, the Duchess, rejects Antonio’s philosophy—although even she cannot escape the metaphorical thinking ingrained in the world of the play. In response to Antonio, she produces two images of her own:
            Though she initially rejects Antonio’s philosophy outright, the Duchess reveals her own uncertainty about the nature and meaning of her suffering by introducing a second figurative interpretation. Her images inject the play with what could be seen as an optimistic view of divine involvement in human life, and she asserts her own ability to make “sense” of her pain through concepts developed out of her personal experience, not generalized

Abstract: Peperzak critiques the self-image of philosophy as “strictly autonomous thought, in the strong, wholly independent, and autarkic sense of this word” (129). Philosophy in this, typically modern, mold starts with a laudable commitment to freedom but ends up “obsessed by the sovereign position of an ego on top of a panoramic universe” (156) and coldly abstracted from the particularities of individual thinkers, its discourse closed off from relation to others.<br>

Abstract: Benjamin also notes: “Every present day is determined by the images that are synchronic with it: each ‘now’ is the now of a particular recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the
            intentio, which thus coincides with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the now to form a constellation” (2002, N3,1). The two great related demands made by T. S. Eliot in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” will also be recalled here: his call for the exercise of the “historical sense” as a juxtaposition of significant events from discontinuous times, which in turn produces an “impersonal” (nonintentional) effect. These demands define the representation of history in works such asThe Waste Landand Pound’s early cantos.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: jams.2004.57.issue-3<br>
Date: February 2005<br>
Author(s): Higgins Paula<br>
Abstract: Within the theoretical framework of Roland Barthes's writings on myth and ideology, this essay seeks to expose the historical legitimation project through which the mythmaking, universalizing rhetoric of musical genius that has long surrounded the figure of Ludwig van Beethoven came to infiltrate scholarship on Josquin des Prez, culminating in his late twentieth-century apotheosis. Contextualizing the composer's reception history with respect to the debates between Joseph Kerman and Edward Lowinsky in 1965 and especially the 1971 Josquin Festival-Conference, the author suggests that the ideological refashioning of Josquin in the image of Beethoven has simultaneously shaped and derailed the intellectual trajectory of early music scholarship in the past thirty years. By privileging a discourse of musical genius in the service of which, among other concerns, the canon of works attributed to the composer is being decimated beyond historical recognition, the richness and complexity of the musical culture of which he was a vital part risks being overshadowed and obfuscated by the disproportionate amount of attention invested in his singular accomplishments. The essay advocates a resolute historicization of sixteenth-century discourses of creative endowment, a critical reassessment of the role of authentication scholarship in Josquin studies, and a renewed sensitivity to the imbrication of mythologies of musical genius in music historiographies of both the past and the present.<br>

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Journal Title: Curriculum Inquiry<br>
Article Title: Formal Fascinations and Nagging Excerpts: The Challenge of the Arts to Curriculum and Inquiry<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Abstract: History, like a vast river, propels logs, vegetation, rafts, and debris; it is full of live and dead things, some destined for resurrection; it mingles many waters and holds in solution invisible substances stolen from distant soils. Anything may become part of it; that is why it can be an image of the continuity of mankind. And it is also why some of its freight turns up again in the social sciences: they were constructed out of the contents of history in the same way as houses in medieval Rome were made out of stones taken from the Coliseum. But the special sciences based on sorted facts cannot be mistaken for rivers flowing in time and full of persons and events. They are systems fashioned with concepts, numbers, and abstract relations. For history, the reward of eluding method is to escape abstraction. (Barzun 1974, 95)<br>

Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: "The mirror stage is a drama whose internal thrust is precipitated from insuffi-

spatial identification [with its specular image], the succession of phantasies that extends
from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality that I shall call orthopaedic - and,
lastly, to the assumption of the armour of an alienating identity, which will mark with its
rigid structure the subject's entire mental development" (p. 4)<br>

Abstract: Refiriéndose a Jean-Jacques Rousseau en "From/of Blindness to the Supplement", Derrida
ofrece varias aproximaciones a la noción del suplemento tales como: "The supplement adds
itself, it is a surplus, a plenitude enriching another plenitude, the fullest measure of presence.
It cumulates and accumulates presence. It is thus that art, techné, image, representation, con-
vention, etc., come as supplements to nature... But the supplement supplements. It adds only
to replace. It intervenes or insinuates itself in-the-place-of; if it fills, it is as if one fills a void.
If it represents and makes an image, it is by the anterior default of a presence. Compensatory
[suppléant] and victorious, the supplement is an adjunct, a subaltern instance which takes-
(the)-place [tient-lieu]'. As a substitute, it is not simply added to the positivity of a presence,
it produces no relief, its place is assigned in the structure by the mark of an emptiness.
Somewhere, something can be filled up of itself, can accomplish itself, only by allowing itself
to be filled through sign and proxy. The sign is always the supplement of the thing itself.

Issue: i20872519<br>
Date: 5 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): CAZÉ Antoine<br>
Abstract: This close reading of one poem by Dickinson, « Crisis is sweet », wishes to demonstrate that the poet makes us share in a multiple experience of crisis combining sexual climax, mystical revelation, and the destruction of the poetic image. Positing a multi-level definition of crisis, the poem shows that the very process of definition — undoubtedly one of Dickinson's preferred modes of tackling with reality — entails a fundamental crisis and criticism of representation.<br>

Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Abstract: Jaspers' thesis (while rejecting the claim of philosophers of the Western tradition to universal validity and Truth, yet conceding that their metaphysical systems express an awareness of Being) is as follows: "Reality is neither the object nor the subject, but that which encompasses both, the Encompassing which is illuminated in the division between subject and object"; He — the One God — is Encompassing and the greatest closeness which has its place within the inwardness of man". The whole inquiry leads Jaspers to claim that the existential self is rooted in Transcendence and the ground of all things lies in the real ization of the existential self in freedom in which eternity and time coalesce. In this freedom time — far from being the "moving image of eternity" — becomes the actual scene of the existential self's moral striving with the forces of this world, and by seizing the cipher (= the language of Transcendence) as the symbol of Transcendence, the existential self achieves authentic existence, thus endowing the historical process of time with unique and ultimate meaning. 1) Reason: It is because of reason with which God has endowed man that any content of a pretended revelation possesses any self-evidencing power: "In diesem Menschwerden durch Vernunft wird das Eine der Transzendenz fühlbar dem Einen der jeweils geschichtlichen Existenz". Yet by abandoning belief in universal Truth we become open for Truth, realised and determined in its concrete historic form for each individual by means of communication. Communication therefore becomes "the universal condition of man's being". It follows that Truth cannot be separated from communicability. It only appears in time as a realitythrough-communication so much so "that I can not even become myself alone without emerging out of my being with others". Now the element in which existential communication lives and moves and has its spiritual being is — reason ("reason is what penetrates everything"). 2) Unity of Mank~<br>

Abstract: Dans le sillage de la critique heideggérienne de Husserl, une telle carac-
térisation a été proposée, entre autres, par Friedrich-Wilhelm von Hermann dans
Hermeneutik und Reflexion (Francfort, Klostermann, 2000), qui oppose la phé-
noménologie heideggérienne — phénoménologie herméneutique ou phénoméno-
logie du Dasein — à la phénoménologie husserlienne — phénoménologie de la
conscience ou phénoménologie réflexive. Pour une mise à l'épreuve assez précoce
de cette image de la philosophie de Husserl, nous renvoyons à l'étude de Thomas
M. Seebohm, « Reflexion and Totality in the Philosophy of E. Husserl », Journal
of the British Society for Phenomenology, 1/1973, pp. 20-30, p. 26 en particulier.

Abstract: Le patrimoine est devenu un terme particulièrement utilisé dans le vocabulaire politique et culturel tout autant qu'il est devenu très usité dans le monde académique. De l'avis de bien des auteurs, tout serait devenu patrimoine. Certains s'inquiètent de cette inflation patrimoniale, considérée comme un symptôme d'un nouveau rapport au temps présent. Cette contribution tente de montrer, en partant du champ d'investigation travaillé par les géographes, que toutes ces approches peuvent en réalité être reconsidérées de manière plus globale. Ce texte pose l'hypothèse qu'elles s'inscrivent dans une chronogenèse, c'est-à-dire une mise en récit des éléments épars grâce à la création d'un discours caractérisé par une accumulation de signes et d'éléments permettant de penser et de se représenter linéairement l'image-temps. En s'inspirant notamment du travail engagé par P. Ricœur sur la notion de temporalité, ce texte défend l'idée que les éléments patrimonialisés participent d'une logique de mise en intrigue, et plus largement d'une mise en cohérence d'éléments hétérogènes, servant à articuler des récits. Ceux-ci autorisent à repenser une certaine unité de l'histoire de l'humanité dans son rapport au monde physique. Heritage has become a very common term in political and cultural discourse, as well as a widely used term in the academic world. Numerous authors have pointed out that everything has become heritage, and expressed concern that such terminological inflation can be seen as a symptom of a new relationship to the present. Based on investigations conducted primarily by French geographers, this paper explores this academic research as revealing a process of "Chronogenesis" (Chronogenèse) : in this, scattered elements are embedded into a narrative, creating a discourse characterized by an accumulation of signs and elements that allows a linear conception and representation of the image and time. Inspired by the work of P. Ricœur on the notion of temporality, this article~<br>

Abstract: Les géographes français ont jusqu'à présent peu questionné leur rapport intellectuel et disciplinaire au terrain. En reprenant l'image de l'Arlésienne, cliché langagier de la présence/absence, l'auteur développe l'hypothèse d'une « fiction » collective, simultanément convoquée mais fort peu explicitée. L'article aborde successivement plusieurs registres d'analyse pour cerner les enjeux disciplinaires soulevés par une démarche réflexive sur le « terrain », objet de recherche. Trois approches sont privilégiées : la place et le statut du « terrain » dans les usages académiques et les analyses épistémologiques de la discipline, les relations complexes entre écritures scientifiques et factures littéraires (le géographe comme auteur), enfin les conséquences de la suprématie du visuel dans le rapport du géographe au terrain. L'article invite enfin à s'approprier collectivement une réflexion sur le « terrain » alors que les technologies numériques modifient en profondeur les codes de la représentation, en particulier visuelle. Until now, French geographers have rarely questioned their intellectual and disciplinary relationship with fieldwork. Using the image of the "Arlesian woman", a French cliché of simultaneous presence and absence, the author develops the hypothesis of a collective "fiction", always evoked but almost never clarified. The paper presents successive analytical levels to assess the disciplinary issues stemming from a reflexive approach of the "field" as research object. Three specific approaches have been chosen: first, the place and status of "fieldwork" in the academic usage and in the epistemological analyses of the discipline, then the complex relationships between scientific and literary ways of writing (the geographer as an author), and last the consequences of the dominance of visualization in the relationship between geographers and their fields. To conclude, the paper invites us to collectively appropriate a reflexion on "fieldwork", when digital t~<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i23508848<br>

Author(s): Stawarska Beata<br>
Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: By incorporating the battle of Waterloo into the events of their novels, Hugo and Stendhal create a portrait of its principal protagonist, Napoléon ler. Associated in one case with a spatial prison out of time and in the other case with a temporal exile out of space, the image of the emperor is that of a figure of power deprived of time and, consequently, of its legitimacy. Stendhal imprisons his character in the present to deny the reality of Napoleon's defeat. Hugo, on the other hand, exiles his character from the present to link the past to the future and propose a new model of heroism.<br>

I explore not only the way in which Reeve struggles with his public image as Superman, but also the way in which Reeve's narrative continually fast forwards through episodes of pain and suffering, in order to keep the strong and powerful image of the Super-Crip intact.<br>

Author(s): Pérez Lara Campos<br>
Abstract: This article takes a close look at the iconographic construction of the so-called "otherness" in Spain between 1936 and 1945. During this three year period of civil unrest, the Franco regime set out to cast the defeated half of the war as an inimical "other." In this process of building an impression of the "other," the "New State," created after April 1, 1939, played an important role, since in many ways the existence of this enemy "other" could favour unity between the rest, or "us." The State used mandatory education as an efficient socialization tool in this process. The text looks at the different ways in which the image of the "other" was used in books that taught History, Civic Education and Patriotic Education in primary school.<br>

Abstract: In this study we relate four different measures: the theodicy models proposed by van der Ven, the coping strategies proposed by Pargament, a measure of positive or negative self-image and the post critical belief scales we ourselves have developed. We analysed the data of 251 Dutch-speaking Belgians. In the analysis we focus on the relation of the different measures with the post critical belief scales. Different types of believers are using different theodicy models, somewhat different coping strategies and we observe some differences in self-image, where believers have a more positive self-image than non-believers. We could suggest that there is a specific theodicy model used by symbolic believers and another theodicy model used by more literal believers. The former could be interpreted as more developed and perhaps more religiously mature.<br>

Abstract: Dans la littérature antillaise, les métaphores naturelles symbolisent la conception de l'identité des mouvements littéraires: l'arbre de la négritude, le rhizome de l'antillanité, la mangrove de la créolité. C'est en transformant cette pratique que Gisèle Pineau "s'insère dans le débat théorique littéraire actuel" (Florence Ramond Jurney). En effet, si ses confrères remplacent une image naturelle par une autre en arguant que cette dernière représente plus justement l'identité antillaise, Pineau réfléchit à la violence inhérente à la structure métaphorique en inventant ce que j'appelle une "métaphore imbriquée." Que ce soit l'arbre dans L'Exil selon Julia (1997) ou le cyclone dans L'Espérance-macadam (1995), j'analyserai d'abord comment ces métaphores imbriquées révèlent les effets nuisibles de cette conceptualisation sur les personnages. Ensuite, je considérerai comment, à travers cette figure stylistique, l'auteure pense autrement l'identité antillaise. Enfin, j'envisagerai comment sa réflexion sur l'identité culturelle via les images naturelles a évolué dans ses romans plus récents.<br>

Publisher: Esprit<br>
Issue: i24256635<br>
Date: 5 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Helcinel Gaston<br>
Abstract: A. Badiou, le Siècle, op. cit., p. 226. On comprend que Badiou ne reprenne pas la
réflexion éculée sur l'art moderne, destructeur de toutes les formes, comme image de la barbarie
destructrice du siècle et de ses crimes. Mais qu'elle soit éculée ne signifie pas qu'elle soit tota-
lement fausse. Au passage, je signale une erreur sur la traduction d'un « titre décisif » de Male-
vitch : Die gegenstandlose Welt veut dire, jusqu'à preuve du contraire, « le monde sans objet » et
non pas « le monde de la non-représentation » (p. 86) - mais il se peut que Malevitch, que je
n'ai pas lu, avait bien en vue ce dernier...<br>

Author(s): Garapon Antoine<br>
Abstract: Cette « starisation » qui affecte de manière générale toute la justice, qui est au cœur de
la démocratie d'opinion, prend un sens particulier s'agissant du terrorisme. Ce dernier déplace
en effet « le champ de bataille sur le terrain de l'image et du symbole », et les démocraties sont
tentées de répondre sur ce terrain en exploitant les ressources de la mise en scène judiciaire.
« La spécialisation des juges, des procureurs et des policiers dans ce domaine peut ajouter à un
phénomène déjà suffisamment prisonnier de son contexte politique » (F. Thuillier, « La menace
terroriste : essai de typologie », art. cité, p. 42), en d'autres termes surenchérir un terrorisme
qui se nourrit de médiatisation.<br>

Author(s): Fischer Francisco Díez<br>
Abstract: Borges a profondément réfléchi sur ces indépassables de la traduction et il a remarqué,
par exemple, l'impossibilité d'exprimer en anglais l'idée de estd sentadita qui transmet non
seulement l'image d'une fille assise, mais aussi abandonnée, et solita (toute seule). Dans l'un
de ses textes, qui est peu connu, The Spanish Language in South America, a Literary Problem,
publié à Londres en 1964, il présente ces difficultés dans le cadre d'un possible futur bilin-
guisme planétaire entre l'espagnol et l'anglais. On peut aussi le trouver dans ses articles
publiés dans Revista Sur, n° 338-339, « Las versiones homéricas » et « El oficio de traducir ».<br>

Abstract: Le constat de la crise du sens ne date pas d'aujourd'hui ; ni même peut-être d'hier. À y bien réfléchir, ne faut-il pas remonter à la Rome antique pour trouver l'image d'un « monde » cohérent et sensé ? Mais le monde romain lui-même est entré en crise, crise que le christianisme a révélée, et dans laquelle, à bien des égards, nous sommes toujours.<br>

Author(s): Ricœur Paul<br>
Abstract: Pour P. Ricœur relisant Matière et Mémoire de Bergson et Être et Temps de Heidegger, il existe un oubli « de réserve » qui, loin d'effacer complètement les traces de l'image passée, conserve celles-ci à l'état de latence et permet ce « petit miracle » qu'est la reconnaissance. La compétition entre l'oubli définitif et l'inoubliable permet donc de penser la survivance des images et place les mécanismes de l'oubli au fondement de l'homme de mémoire.<br>

Abstract: By establishing a parallel between the cycle of Lumière films and the Age of the Enlightenment ("siècle des lumières"), the author identifies the pensive character of the films' images as well as the aesthetic of the visible world they display. She then examines the transformation of a time-image into a memory-image in the Lumière films, arguing that the films are not only offer time-images, that is, residual images of the past, but have become images-as-memory in the contemporary spectator's mind.<br>

Abstract: L'élargissement du statut de Juste aux personnes exécutées s'inscrit dans les nouveaux modes de l'évocation de
l'aide aux juifs. Celle-ci était marquée par la conviction que « le monde » ignorait que « la Pologne était le seul pays
parmi les États européens occupés par l'Allemagne nazie où l'aide aux juifs était punie de la peine de mort ». La force
de ce sentiment de « malveillance étrangère » à l'égard de la Pologne, due à l'ignorance du contexte de l'occupation
dans ce pays, a été exprimée avec force par le gouvernement de Lech Kaczynski qui, dans le prolongement de ses
actions contre l'usage de l'expression « camps d'extermination polonais » dans les médias étrangers, a créé, en août
2006,1'« Office central de la défense et de la promotion de l'image de la Pologne »<br>

Article Title: Indicating Heaven: Botticelli's "Coronation of the Virgin" and Mediated Imagery<br>
Publisher: IRSA<br>
Issue: i24595727<br>
Date: 1 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Burroughs Charles<br>
Abstract: Through the analysis of a major religious painting by Botticelli, this article builds on important recent work on Botticelli's sacred art to explore apparent responses on the part of an especially sophisticated artist to the gathering atmosphere of crisis in the city's political and religious life. The artist uses various devices of connection or separation between the viewer/worshiper and the holy image; these devices are not unique to the painting, but their combination is exceptional. First, Botticelli uses a hieratic gold ground to distinguish a scene set in heaven, the coronation of the Virgin, from a more earthly zone; here recent scruples about the representation of transcendence seem to be in play. Second, the figures beneath, four major saints, embody different ways of addressing the viewer and mediating between him/her and the heavenly event. Third, the latter appears to be treated as an apsidal image within an implied architectural setting, in other words, as a representation of a representation. By establishing modes of mediation, then, Botticelli confronts issues emerging as central to the representation of the sacred, in part on the basis of a critical understanding of Albertian picture theory.<br>

Author(s): Bruns Gerald L.<br>
Abstract: The basic unit of Joyce's fiction is, arguably, the encounter, a reminder of the Dubliners story of that name. This essay explores the many occasions of self-encounter, as when Joyce's characters see themselves in mirrors, in the eyes of others, or in the guise of someone other than they are or appear to be: when Gerty MacDowell projects her "Lady Bountiful" self onto Bloom's erotic gaze, for instance. The regulating idea here (as in Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception) is that we perceive ourselves through our bodies, but this perception is not an empirical mirror-image; it is an image mediated (and thus transformed) by an array of intentions, memories, desires, and ongoing experiences of ourselves and others, including our experiences of how others see us (something to which Stephen is particularly subject). Joyce's mirror-experiences range from ironic unmasking—"The Dead"—to phantasmagorias—the "Circe" episode of Ulysses, where no image is unreal, and every misnomer (like "Henry Flower") has its moment of truth.<br>

Abstract: En este trabajo se propone una interpretación de la identidad de los santos tzeltales (en la región de los Altos de Chiapas, México) desde la perspectiva del concepto indígena de persona. Partiendo de la concepción que los tzeltales tienen de la persona, como un compuesto homogéneo en su vertiente exterior y heterogéneo en su vertiente interior, aquí se explora la posibilidad de que los santos tzeltales representen una inversión de este modelo. En tal caso, la imagen de los santos descubriría aquello que en los seres humanos se encuentra oculto en el interior del corazón, esto es, sus almas. Esta posibilidad se explora a través de tres campos principales : la imagen de los santos que se encuentran en el interior de la iglesia, la narrativa sobre los santos y la función de los santos en los textos terapéuticos chamánicos. Le présent travail propose une interprétation de l'identité des saints tzeltals (Chiapas, Mexique) à la lumière du concept indigène de la personne. En partant de la conception que les Tzeltals ont de la personne humaine comme un composé homogène dans son versant extérieur et hétérogène dans son versant intérieur on explore ici la possibilité que les saints représentent une inversion de ce modèle. Dans ce cas, l'image des saints exposerait ce qui, dans l'être humain, se trouve caché à l'intérieur du cœur, c'est-à-dire ses âmes. On explore cette hypothèse dans trois champs : l'image des saints à l'intérieur de l'église, les récits sur les saints et la fonction des saints dans les prières de guérison. This paper uses indigenous concepts of Personhood to redefine the identify of saints among the Tzeltal (Chiapas, Mexico). Considering the Tzeltal conceive the Self as a homogeneous compound in its outside and a heterogeneous one in its inside, the author explores the possibility that Tzeltal Saints might precisely invert this pattern. If so, the image of the saints would reveal that which — in living beings — is hidden within the heart : namely their soul~<br>

Abstract: Pour un panorama d'ensemble sur les évolutions historiographiques des années 1990-2000,
cf. Delacroix, Dosse & Garcia (2007) et Delacroix et al., eds (2010), où l'on peut clairement
mesurer le recul des problématiques anthropologiques classiques au sein du travail des historiens.
On pourra voir aussi le colloque déjà cité (Brilli, Dufal & Dittmar, eds 2010), ainsi que la table
ronde publiée par la Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine (Minard et al. 2002), avec la parti-
cipation de Jocelyne Dakhlia, Serge Gruzinski, Jean-Clément Martin, Michel Naepels et Michel
Nassiet. Cette rencontre témoigne, entre autres choses, du statut particulier occupé par la parenté
dans les liens entre anthropologie et histoire : c'est sans doute dans ce domaine que l'apport de
l'anthropologie d'inspiration structuraliste, qu'il s'agisse de Claude Lévi-Strauss, de Françoise Héritier,
de Françoise Zonabend ou, sur un registre critique mais inscrit dans le même paradigme,.../...
[Suite de la note 4] de Maurice Godelier, a été le plus durable (Burguière et al. 1986), comme le
montrent, en histoire du Moyen Âge, les recherches de Régine Le Jan ou d'Anita Guerreau-
Jalabert, ou en histoire moderne, celles de Gérard Delille, Michel Nassiet ou, plus récemment,
d'Elie Haddad. Les dynamiques proprement anthropologiques de renouvellement de ce champ,
qui apparaissent clairement par exemple dans le travail de Klaus Hamberger et l'introduction de la
dimension spatiale dans l'approche structurale, expliquent sans doute la persistance de cette
approche dans l'étude de ce domaine, qui a cependant également intégré progressivement une
méthodologie plus pragmatique, à l'image du numéro spécial de la revue Médiévales coordonné par
Didier Lett (2008) qu'on peut rapprocher de l'orientation méthodologique du travail de Florence
Weber, dans le domaine ethnographique. On peut enfin également songer à l'héritage majeur de
l'anthropologie dans le domaine de l'histoire ancienne, dans une perspective plus poli~<br>

Abstract: Mes propres recherches en République démocratique du Congo m'ont permis de mettre en
évidence un déplacement similaire, mais situant l'événement délégué en amont plutôt qu'en aval
de l'événement fondateur. À travers l'enseignement scolaire de niveau élémentaire, en langues
locales et dispensé par les missions chrétiennes, le pouvoir colonial belge a cherché à asseoir sa
légitimité sur le souvenir de l'éradication de la traite orientale : le recours à la symbolique biblique
lui a conféré la valeur de « sortie d'Égypte ». Cependant, la mémoire collective congolaise a opéré
un renversement des qualifications. Dans son discours à la cérémonie d'accession à la souveraineté
nationale, le Premier ministre congolais, Patrice Lumumba, a qualifié la période coloniale
d'esclavage. Puis, la peinture populaire urbaine, principal médium d'expression de la mémoire,
présente Lumumba comme le Moïse des Congolais, esclaves de l'État colonial. Une autre icône de
cette mémoire présente la peine de fouet administrée à un prisonnier sous l'œil d'un administrateur
colonial. Le drapeau belge - jaune, noir et rouge - flotte au-dessus de la scène. Le prisonnier porte
un maillot rayé noir et jaune alors que le fouet trace des lignes de sang rouges sur ses fesses nues.
Le sujet colonial est propriété de l'État, son esclave. Cette image emprunte son organisation à la
fameuse peinture Le Châtiment des quatre piquets dans les colonies de Marcel Verdier (1843),
probablement via un tableau belge de la fin du XIXe siècle de Mandau intitulé « La civilisation
au Congo ». Le réfèrent esclavage façonné par les mises en signification tirées de la culture globale
n'y conserve aucun lien avec la mémoire vive de l'esclavage interne aux sociétés congolaises.
La traite des esclaves est un événement délégué pour activer le travail de la mémoire de l'asservissement
par l'État colonial puis postcolonial.<br>

Abstract: Calvin even speaks of a 'principle' when discussing the inner coherence of the creation
and its renewal, and so says regarding man as the image of God: 'For although I confess that
these forms of speaking are synechdoches, yet this principle cannot be overthrown, that what
was primary in the renewing of God's image also held the highest place in the creation itself
(Institutes, I, xv, 4).<br>

Abstract: The phrase 'objectly taking place' means 'that which is the object of the history-
keeping subject's attention'. The events which the history-keeper notes, like the art object
which an art critic examines, make the subject dépendent upon them, although it is surely
possible for the inquiring subject as would-be history-keeper or art critic, in the name of
co-dependence, to make the object over into its own subjective image. We might call such
a mistake the Narcissistic fallacy.<br>

Publisher: Brill<br>
Issue: i24708906<br>
Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: H. Dooyeweerd, "Calvinistische Wijsbegeerte," Scientia 1 (1956), 144; quoted in G.C.
Berkouwer, Man: The Image of God, Studies in Dogmatics, trans. Dirk W. Jellema (Grand
Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962), p. 258; henceforth cited as "Man." See Dooyeweerd's comparable
statement in NC, I, 21, where he uses "philosophical" instead of "theoretical" thought; and cf.
TM, VI, on the presuppositional nature of the soul in human theorizing.
The parallels with Scheler's view of the "person" are remarkable here. Much as in
Dooyeweerd's view the "soul" or "heart" can never be objectified, so for Scheler the "person"
can never become an object of analysis; much as in Dooyeweerd's view "acts" come forth out
of the soul but only function within the temporal structure of the human body, so for Scheler
the person acts into time without himself being in time. For Scheler's distinction between
"acts" and "functions," and significant differences in his view of the act-structure, see Max
Scheler, Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die Materiale Wertethik, Gesammelte Werke, Vol;. II, ed.
Maria Scheler (Bern: Francke Verlag, 1954), pp. 395ff.; translated as Formalism in Ethics and
No7t-Formal Ethics of Values (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 385ff. For
the comparable views of Dooyeweerd, see TM XIV and XX, for example. It is possible that
both Dooyeweerd's and Scheler's view of the non-objectifiability of the essential selfhood of
the person is the result of a residual Kantianism.<br>

Abstract: D'autres essaient plutôt de concilier les positions des deux auteurs. Pour certains com-

nienne de la tradition islamique. Cf. \. Özdemir, 1992. Citons également l'article de Norman
K. Swazo, qui pense cette conciliation possible (p. 9) et insiste sur le fait que, d'une part, Rahman
ne rejette pas totalement l'idée de tradition d'interprétation (p. 20), et que d'autre part, à l'image
de Gadamer, il voit également l'interprétation comme un processus historique (p. 25). Cf.

Abstract: This article proposes literary criticism as a source of insight into consumer behavior, presents a broad overview of literary criticism, provides a specific illustrative analysis, and offers suggestions for further research. Literary analysis of advertising text reveals elements that provide additional information to consumer researchers, and contributions of literary criticism to consumer research are discussed. Major post-war critical schools are reviewed, and relevant theoretical concepts summarized. An ad for Ivory Flakes is analyzed using a variety of concepts drawn from literary schools, primarily sociocultural and reader-response ones. Suggestions for additional research on content analysis, image analysis, and the history of consumption are made.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i342769<br>
Date: 12 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Winograd William B.<br>
Abstract: This article draws on the philosophical concept of the hermeneutical circle to explore the cultural viewpoints that underlie the meanings expressed by consumers. Phenomenological interviews were conducted with adult female consumers. The interviews are interpreted first by the identification of an exemplary image or event that we describe as a symbolic metaphor. We show that these symbolic metaphors highlight key personal meanings that each participant ascribed to her consumer experiences. We then use a hermeneutic logic known as intertextual analysis to show that these personal meanings reflect more general cultural viewpoints that are implicitly conveyed in language. These intertextual interpretations offer insights into the sociocultural meanings that underlie skeptical, nostalgic, and pragmatic consumer orientations. A concluding discussion is given to key implications and areas for future research that follow from this hermeneutic approach.<br>

Abstract: K. E. Brashier analyzes the symbolic discourse surrounding a prominent image in many Chinese ancestral stone memorials, namely an ornate tree beside a pavilion where a figure is receiving homage. He traces the arboreal image back to the ancient poem "Birchleaf Pear," which exhorts future generations to safeguard the tree because the Duke of Shao had rested there. He then shows that, in Han literary texts justifying the building of ancestral memorials, the tree stands for long-lived physical things that survive into the present. Symbols can conflate allusions. The central figure within the pavilion is the tomb dedicatee as a Duke of Shao, and the shrine is to be preserved just as the Duke's tree was never to be felled. Past hero and present shrine dedicatee merge into a single icon.<br>

Abstract: Societies, like individuals, strive to have positive self-concepts. They endow stories of their origin and associate their course through history with ethical principles that attest to who they are and how they want to be seen. Such principles define the society for its members and for the world at large. But all societies must at some time confront evidence of actions undertaken in their name that violate their fundamental principles and conflict with their desired self-image. Following a glance at the basic elements of the politics of history and identity, the author suggests two sources of the tensions between "bad acts" and positive self-concepts. Both relate to shifts in developmental time. First, actions not considered wrong when they were undertaken in the past are inconsistent with current expectation. Second, transsocietal differences in normative frameworks lead to cross-boundary criticisms of behavior in which the critics' societies likely engaged at an earlier time. Accusations or criticisms generally meet with defensive, often hostile responses. Hypocrisy tends to rule in most cases, with little or no normative learning.<br>

Abstract: El presente artículo se ubica en el campo de la metodología y refiere a la sistematización de las experiencias etnográficas del trabajo realizado durante varias temporadas en la Oficina María Elena (II Región, Chile), último pueblo de la tradición salitrera. Destaca cómo y desde dónde se va construyendo por parte de sus habitantes el imaginario y la memoria pampina desde el "ser los últimos" representantes de esta tradición laboral, e identificando los ejes de recurrencia en que se apoyan. Asimismo, revela los distintos ángulos desde los cuales se construye la mirada antropológica, y cómo esta va logrando densidad, profundidad y extensión en un juego entre la individualidad y la comunidad, en un contexto en el que permanentemente ronda la imagen del cierre del pueblo y con ello el fin de la cultura pampina. This paper deals with methodology and is centered on systematizing several ethnographic field seasons in María Elena (Northern Chile) the last village within the nitrate tradition. It highlights how and where its inhabitants build their "pampa" imaginary and memory of being the last representatives of such a working tradition. Likewise, we identify the axis of recurrence on which these patterns are based. In addition, this paper reveals the angles from where an anthropological view is created developing density, depth and width within a context containing the image of the village's end and thus the end of the "pampa" culture itself.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein John L.<br>
Abstract: One of the most interesting potential contributions of culture research lies at the intersection of the study of culture and the study of power. At this intersection lies a process of communication in which interested actors present particular understandings of the world in the hope of creating or sustaining preferred patterns of social relations. In this processes, groups and individuals struggle to create and disseminate cultural forms that support preferred patterns of power and dominance. This article presents a methodology, critical hermeneutics, useful in analyzing these attempts. To underscore the usefulness of the approach, we applied the method to a corporation's image advertising campaign, a set of texts intended to restructure the corporation's image and reframe a set of issues in a way favorable to it.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the correspondence between Beckett and Duthuit in the light of the unpublished notes that Beckett took in Germany in 1936-37. The underlying issue that Beckett's reflections on the image seems to address is the reorientation of his creative writing and the development of a new aesthetic. There is, when Beckett is confronted to an image, a double movement that can be discerned in the way he beholds the image, of fascination, first, but also of mistrust towards this painting. In stripping paintings of their narrative of figurative intention, Beckett's comments seem to aim at a situation of mankind in the world, apprehended outside of all preoccupations with its causes or as the effect of an absent cause. Cette contribution examine la correspondance entre Beckett et Duthuit et cherche à la mettre en perspective avec les notes inédites que Beckett prend en Allemagne (1936-37). L'enjeu indirect des réflexions de Beckett sur le problème de l'image, c'est la réorientation de son écriture, le développement d'une esthétique nouvelle. Il y a chez Beckett un double mouvement, de fascination, mais aussi de méfiance, face à l'image. En dépouillant ces peintures de leur charge narrative ou figurative, les commentaires de Beckett semblent viser une situation de l'homme, appréhendée en dehors de toute cause ou comme l'effet d'une cause absente.<br>

Author(s): Ginzburg Carlo<br>
Abstract: Le titre de l'essai a deux significations: il fait allusion, d'un côté, à des lectures qui ont joué un rôle important dans le travail de Marcel Mauss sur le don (notamment, Bronislaw Malinowski et Franz Boas); de l'autre, à quelques lectures importantes qui ont été données de l'Essai sur le don. Les deux niveaux sont liés: l'un clarifie l'autre. Plus spécifiquement, l'essai montre que la réflexion sur le lien impliqué par l'obligation de rendre le don (thème qui est au centre de l'essai de Mauss) a été déclenchée par une lecture très originale de certains passages de l'Émile de Rousseau. Il suit les traces, directes et indirectes, de ce noyau rousseauiste dans la postérité de l'essai de Mauss: de l'interprétation de Hegel donnée par Alexandre Kojève aux lectures divergentes de Mauss données par Claude Lévi-Strauss et Claude Lefort — fondées sur, respectivement, une image non conflictuelle et une image conflictuelle de la société. The paper's title refers, on the one hand, to Mauss's readings for his essay on the gift (from Bronislaw Malinowski to Franz Boas); on the other, to some readings of Mauss's essay by others. The two levels are connected: the former clarifies the latter. More specifically, the paper argues that the reflection on the bond implied by the constraint to reciprocate the gift (an issue which is at the very center of the essay) is the outcome of Mauss's highly original reading of some passages in Rousseau's Émile. The paper follows the posterity, both direct and indirect, of this Rousseauian core in Mauss's essay and its readers, from Alexandre Kojève's interpretation of Hegel, to the divergent readings of Mauss's provided by Claude Lévi-Strauss and Claude Lefort—based on, respectively, a non-conflictual and a conflictual image of society.<br>

Abstract: That Cassian should posit some sort of intrinsic connection between the
soul aflame with love of God and the filial adoption implied in the term "Our
Father" is interesting. It is evocative of a relatively common image in patristic
literature for divinization: wood being burned until it gradually takes on the
properties of fire. The doctrinal thèmes of synergy, divinization, adoption, cré-
ation, and rédemption all Cluster here.<br>

Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: As the disciplines of psychoanalysis and religion find themselves in a heightened cross-disciplinary context, issues of methodology remain at the forefront. This article constructs an interdisciplinary method based on the image of psychoanalysis and religion as neighbors who border along an "intimate edge"—a space of simultaneously overlapping, yet distinct concern. Using what is termed a "hermeneutic of mischievousness," this method maintains an interpretive location for that which preserves, transgresses, and transcends the disciplinary boundaries. The article concludes with a brief application of the method to the relationship between the "analytic third" and Christian trinitarian theology.<br>

Author(s): Dorsey Leroy G.<br>
Abstract: This essay reconceptualizes President Theodore Roosevelt's "anti-trust" image within a "pro-business" framework. Critics who have measured Roosevelt's success by the number of anti-trust suits he brought or won miss the essentially rhetorical purposes of his involvement with corporate America. Specifically, this essay contends that his primary emphasis involved the promotion of the proper attitude in corporate leaders and the general public regarding the role of big business in American society. This Roosevelt did in two ways. First, he argued metaphorically for the necessity of corporations and the restraint of muckraking journalists. Second, along with employing metaphors to chastise big business, Roosevelt assumed the role of moral guardian and preached to corporate leaders to adhere to an ethical standard in business. For Roosevelt, corporate America could be effectively regulated only by its leaders' sense of morality and spirit of public service.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330183<br>
Date: 3 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ohnuki-Tierney Emiko<br>
Abstract: Most symbols are polytropic as well as polysemic in that their multiple meanings in various contexts functions as different types ot trope. This article pursues the complex nature of polytropes through a formulation of synecdoche as an interstitial trope between metaphor and metonymy, and demonstrates how the two conceptual principles of analogy and contiguity, that define metaphor and metonymy respectively, are interdependent and interpenetrated, rather than of basically different natures as presented in the biaxial image of structural linguistics. The analogic thought expressed in methaphor involves movement and temporality, just as does the discursive thought of metonymy. The interpenetration of the two modes of thought is demostrated through an analysis of the process of objectification of what, throughout history, has been a dominant symbol of self in Japanese culture: the monkey. As a polysemic and polytropic symbol, the monkey takes on different meanings, and functions as different tropic types, sequentially or simultaneously, as actors use and/or interpret the symbol in varying historical and social contexts.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i348147<br>
Date: 12 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Weltman Sharon Aronofsky<br>
Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: To serve their purpose well, many so-called mnemonic images in the Middle Ages facilitated meditation and invention by presenting many rich materials in a highly abbreviated form, which could be expanded and recombined for a variety of compositions. To abbreviate fruitfully requires rigorous compression and selection, a kind of forgetting that was distinguished both in theory and practice from rote recitation or learning by heart. The twelfth- and thirteenth-century diagram called the Cherub offers an excellent example of how such an image was used in study and composition. Focusing on six versions of it, this essay demonstrates that the medieval cherub image is not an illustration tied to any particular text but functioned independently as an analytical tool, an art for inventing arguments, which incorporated the methods of medieval dialectic and rhetoric.<br>

Abstract: En marge de la liturgie des saints anges et de la figure anonyme de l'ange gardien que le catholicisme affecte à la protection de chaque fidèle, existe aujourd'hui une angélologie postulant l'existence de soixante-douze anges gardiens nommés et spécialisés, assignés à l'humanité entière en fonction de la date de naissance de l'individu. À travers l'étude des ouvrages concernant ces anges et de quelques entretiens, cet article analyse la construction de cette figure de l'ange, différente de celle que reconnaît l'Église. Cette production syncrétique reprend certains éléments de la conception catholique moderne de l'ange tutélaire et du saint, mais s'inspire aussi des spéculations théologiques des premiers siècles sur les anges, des doctrines kabbalistiques de la Remaissance, de l'occultisme du XIXe siècle et de l'astrologie zodiacale moderne. /// At the frontiers of the liturgy of the Holy Angels and the nameless figure of the guardian angel that catholicism assigns to protect each of the faithful, an angelology has now emerged, proposing the existence of seventy-two guardian angels each with their own name and specialized role, assigned to all humanity according to each person's date of birth. Studying published works on these angels and in the course of a number of interviews, the present article analyses the construction of this figure of the angel, an image that differs from the one recognized by the Catholic Church. This syncretic production takes up certain elements of the modern catholic conception of the angel as guardian and of the saints, but bases itself also on the theoretical speculations on the angels during the first centuries, on the kabbalistic doctrines of the Renaissance, on 19th century occultism and the modern astrology of the zodiac. /// Al margen de la liturgia de los santos ángeles y de la figura anónima del ángel custodio que el catolicismo destina a la protección de cada fiel, existen hoy especulaciones postulando la existencia de setenta y d~<br>

Abstract: Lisa
Steinman offers some support for this view by opposing the visionary's maddening pursuit of the veiled
maiden to the narrator's more chastened desire in the invocation merely to identify "a likeness or image,
which will reveal something to him" (261)<br>

Abstract: Memory and forgetting are key subjects of current historical and sociological research. Their meaning embraces passive as well as active forms of collective recollection and oblivion, activities of retention as well as of dynamic shifting in the broad field of symbolic representation. Applied to Rezeptionsgeschichte and Wirkungsgeschichte in the perspective of the Classical Tradition, those key terms signify the complex interplay between change and continuity. The materials discussed under this assumption mainly range from theories and practices of memory in Antiquity and the Middle Ages to Renaissance systems of architecture and art, from the early emergence of advanced civilizations to a modern conceptualized history of cultural change. The connecting element is the theoretically defined concept of "cultural memory" not only comprising textuality and literary techniques of memory but also image production and ritual activities in non-literate societies. At the end the question will be asked, whether there are any alternative ways of culture-investigation lying hidden within cultural memory itself.<br>

Abstract: Laurence Rickels writes in a Peircean vein: "A mirror-image is not a total or
iconic image but an indexical image, and thus its relation to its object is based
not on identity and simultaneity but on sequential difference and connected-
ness." In his unpublished doctoral dissertation: "The Iconic Imagination,"

Publisher: College Art Association of America<br>
Issue: i354373<br>
Date: 12 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Stock Robert A.<br>
Abstract: Of the many surviving Romanesque cartularies, very few are illuminated. After reviewing general considerations of the oral, textual, and visual elements at play in these works, this paper then focuses on the Vierzon Cartulary, particularly on the processes of its charters' transcription to codex. Specifically, this paper argues the performative role of the scribe and illuminator, who, by their transformation of the mise-en-page, appropriation of papal notarial authority, and translation of sealing practice, participated in a new diplomatic ceremony of conveyance. This paper advances a reconsideration of text-image relations to account for ritual performance, both actual and symbolic.<br>

Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000935<br>
Date: 3 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i40008393<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Browne M. Neil<br>
Abstract: The doctrine of comparable worth is frequently denounced by economists as inefficient, unnecessary, unworkable, incredibly costly, and replete with unfortunate consequences for the same low-wage workers it alleges to be helping. This paper attempts to identify an explanation for both the vigor and content of economists' common antipathy toward comparable worth. The methodology of the paper is taken from Donald McCloskey's recent The Rhetoric of Economics and Feyerabend's epistemology of conversation. A content analysis of economists' criticisms of comparable worth reveals a much different methodology from that deified in the beginning chapters of Principles of Economics texts. Facts and empirical validation are not the primary bases responsible for their conclusions. The theoretical and empirical support for current relative wages is not solid enough to explain either the nearunanimity of economists' arguments or their vitriolic tone. This paper analyzes the fundamental role played by metaphor in guiding economists' analysis of comparable worth. Metaphor is treated in this paper as a pre-rational image that, much like Kuhn's paradigms, provides insight and establishes blind spots.<br>

Abstract: O presente artigo procura apresentar algumas das principais características do diálogo de Paul Ricoeur com a psicanálise freudiana no contexto da sua hermenêutica filosófica. Num primeiro momento, o artigo começa por se referir ao contacto inicial de Ricoeur com a problemática da psicanálise na obra La symbolique du mal. Num segundo momento, considerando a obra Essai sur Freud, o artigo procura situar a psicanálise como uma arqueologia do sujeito a ser conjugada com as instâncias teleológica (Hegel) e escatológica (filosofia da religião). A cumplicidade das três instâncias representa o terceiro ponto do presente ensaio: o desejo transforma-se na instância comum entre elas. O quarto ponto explicita a articulação entre o arqueo-lógico/pulsional e o teleológico/espiritual no domínio da arte: o passado pulsional é subsumido nas dimensões teleológica e escatológica do sentido. O quinto ponto trata da figura do pai presente na imagem de Deus que se encontra na Bíblia: ele regressa de um modo que está para além do mero antropomorfismo, assinalado como está pela realização de promessas futuras. Uma tal figura provoca um repensar dos afectos arcaicos referentes ao medo da punição. Um sexto ponto oferece uma apreciação geral da hermenêutica filosófica de Ricoeur e da resistência que ela propõe a todas as formas de subjectivismo. Finalmente, o artigo refere-se ainda ao modo como fé e filosofia se encontram e se afectam mutuamente ao mesmo tempo que uma e outra mantêm as suas características distintas. /// The present article seeks to present some of the main features of Paul Ricoeur's dialogue with Freudian psychoanalysis in the context of his philosophical hermeneutics.

Abstract: African American quiltmaking began to gain recognition as an expressive form distinct from European American quiltmaking in the countercultural climate of the 1970s. Representations of it since then have served to update the Eurocentric, patriotic image of quiltmaking in the United States with components ofmulticulturalism and cultural critique. These representations in turn caused tensions along the lines of class, race, gender, and scholarly discipline. This study shows the power of words and things when used together, as in museum exhibits, to affirm or challenge the existing social order.<br>

Abstract: The rationalist fantasy of the Enlightenment is the myth of the nonviolent origins of virtue, typically represented through the image of rational birth. This myth falters when Odoardo Galotti, invoking the second birth of reason, kills his daughter. This article examines Lessing's Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts-essentially a treatise on the phylogeny/ontogeny distinction-in terms of a recuperative rationalist gesture that continues to inform Freud's oedipal theory as well as Claude Lévy-Strauss's understanding of the "cerebral savage." These theories are not treated as methodological frameworks for reading Lessing but rather as evidence of the tanacity of Enlightenment desires, which are already problematized by texts like Emilia Galotti.<br>

Author(s): Lee Sherry D.<br>
Abstract: Early twentieth-century Viennese modernity, obsessed with identity in crisis, was especially preoccupied with the play between external appearances and internal dimensions of the self. This is the context for Alexander Zemlinsky's opera Der £ werg, which stages the tragic tale of an ugly, misshapen individual who does not recognize his own mirror image. The fatal end to his encounter with his reflection speaks to the devastating consequences of the limits of self-knowledge. While multiple conceptions of recognition— ranging from self-identity to the need for acknowledgement by others— have become increasingly prominent in recent literary, philosophical, and political discourses, theories of recognition have rarely played a role in the interpretation of operatic works. Here, the engagement with Zemlinsky's opera, and the Oscar Wilde text on which it is based, is framed and informed by the multivalent concept of recognition, which illuminates both the thematic and the structural workings of the music and libretto, while reflecting productively on the wider personal and political dimensions of their cultural contexts.<br>

Abstract: L'accord entre psychanalyse et philosophie ne s'est toujours pas fait. Pourtant les psychanalystes s'intéressent à Heidegger et il y a des philosophes heideggeriens qui lisent Freud et Lacan. Les thèmes d'intérêt commun se situent tous autour de la problématique du langage : la découverte d'un décentrement, la „fin de la métaphysique” et un certain parallélisme entre l'impensé et l'inconscient. On ne peut pas expliquer le rapport entre philosophie et psychanalyse dans les termes de la problématique traditionnelle philosophie-science. La psychanalyse met en question aussi bien la philosophie que la science en les prenant comme un discours qui n'est pasessentiellement différent du discours du patient dans la cure analytique. Ce discours, c'est l'homme qui le tient pour un autre ; en parlant il veut faire passer l'image de soi-même et du monde qui leur donne objectivité et identité. Mais l'homme n'est pas maître de ce discours, il parle en fragments qui appartiennent à une légende déjà existante. Il ne revient pas à l'analyste de nier ou d'affirmer ce discours, il n'a d'égards que pour sa continuité. La philosophie aussi bien que la science, il les prend comme des discours qui n'ont un sens que dans la mesure où leur progression porte des fruits. En prétendant qu'aussi bien la philosophie spéculative que la phénoménologie se meuvent dans l'imaginaire, la psychanalyse mène inévitablement à la question du statut de la philosophie. S'agit-il là d'un système d'affirmations fondées ou plutôt d'une interrogation sans fin ? Mais la critique psychanalytique porte aussi sur cette interrogation en tant que celle-ci est un moment du discours philosophique. C'est en tant que discours que la philosophie heideggerienne se rapproche de la psychanalyse. Elle annonce la „fin de la philosophie”, de la philosophie comme fait historique qui a pris fin avec Hegel et la science moderne. Il y a eu des philosophes, mais leur activité philosophique a été dominée de part et d'autre par une inst~<br>

Abstract: Cette conférence présente une méditation sur un livre dans lequel les problèmes philosophiques semblent déborder tant les frontières du récit de fiction que le cadre du roman dit historique. Plutôt que d'entreprendre une analyse tant soit peu exhaustive du livre de Eco, elle s'étend, tout en s'inspirant des données fournies par celui-ci, sur une question préalable, mais qui commande en un sens toute lecture ultérieure, celle notamment des connivences entre le discours philosophique et le discours littéraire, question finalement assez proche de celle du statut de la fiction dans son rapport au dire-vrai. L'auteur du Nom de la rose nous fait prendre conscience de ce rapport par la mise en place d'une série de dispositifs narratifs et discursifs relevant, d'une part, du moyen âge (la chronique, le raisonnement à partir de « principes premiers » ), d'autre part, de la modernité (le roman policier, la sémiotique ) ; il y a lieu de parler ici d'une structure polyphonique délibérément discordante, constamment traversée d'échos de livres anciens, nouveaux, voire inexistants. C'est dans ce jeu de textes se reflétant que le vrai et l'imaginaire s'entremêlent ; c'est là aussi que s'ouvre cet espace apocalyptique et ambigu où le sens momentanément en suspens est donné à se chercher et se redéfinir sur un mode encore inconnu et par conséquent catastrophique. L'image du labyrinthe acquiert ici tout son poids. L'effet signalé peut être défini comme un phénomène de dislocation. Ce même phénomène est ensuite approfondi à l'aide de trois points qui jouent dans Le nom de la rose un rôle important : 1. la rupture qu'opère dans le discours médiéval le personnage de William, 2. la signification de la souffrance dans sa relation au langage, 3. la dialectique du rire. C'est surtout ce dernier qui, à travers son rapport à l'idée de « césure » (césure du comique, césure du tragique), fait apparaître la theâtralité foncière de tout comportement humain. L'exposé se termine par l'hypothèse, pru~<br>

Abstract: Rather than reading the work of Richard K. Ashley as iconic - as some dead, stable image used to signify the whole of post-modern or post-structural International Relations (IR) in a single swoop - this article considers Ashley's work as an interruption to the discipline of IR (mainstream and critical). In so doing, the article suggests that what is important about Ashley's work is how it creates a thinking space where it is possible to think again about international politics, about international theory, about what Ashley's interruption itself permits and limits and about how this interruption unfolds and sometimes folds back on itself.<br>

Author(s): Campe Rüdiger<br>
Abstract: The figuration of "evidenþia" is a rather poorly documented and rarely debated branch of the rhetorical production of images although it is closely connected with the emergence of the notion of "Darstellung" in 18th-century aesthetics. Two features of this proto-aesthetical device will be discussed: The first characteristic is the diagrammatical nature of this figure—examples used are geometrical diagrams or statistical tables rather than pictorial images. The second characteristic is the inherent relation to media translation—the diagrammatic "image" is produced through and "instead of" words and sentences evoking that image. Both aspects underline the relation of the evidential image to language and writing.<br>

Abstract: L'auteure présente un outil d'exploration des situations sociales : l'arrêt sur image. Elle revient sur ses diverses contraintes techniques et méthodologiques et démontre leur intérêt au sein d'une enquête inspirée par la sociologie de l'action. C'est en tenant compte de la temporalité des actions humaines que l'image semble pouvoir évoluer d'un rôle d'illustration à celui d'outil d'analyse. En passant indifféremment d'image animée à image statique, l'enregistrement vidéo permet un choix de séquences filmées et une lecture multiple des contextes observés. Il aide à suivre finement les activités des acteurs, et à mettre en évidence la différence entre les normes du groupe et celles de l'individu. The author présents a tool for explorating social situations : freezing on the frame. She evokes its various technical and methodological limits and shows its interest for a survey inspired by action sociology. By taking into account the temporality of human actions the image can be more than illustrative and become an analysis tool. By passing indiscriminately from an animated image to a static one video recording permits a sélection of filmed séquences and a multiple reading of the observed contexts. It helps to follow minutely the actors' activities and to show the différence between group norms and individual norms. Die Autorin stellt ein Beobachtungsmittel der sozialen Lagen dar : das Standbild. Sie beschreibt seine verschiedenen technischen und methodologischen Beschränkungen und zeigt sein Interesse für eine von der Handlungssoziologie inspirierten Erhebung. Durch die Berücksichtigung der Zeitlichkeit der Menschenhandlungen ist das Bild mehr als illustrativ und kann zum Analysemittel werden. Beim unterschiedslosen Übergehen von einem belebten zu einem statischen Bild bietet die Videoaufnahme eine Auswahl von gefilmten Bildfolgen und ein vielfaches Lesen der beobachteten Kontexten.

Abstract: Au Brésil, le récit officiel concernant la mémoire de l'esclavage différe nettement de la vision des leaders du mouvement noir contemporain, notamment à propos de la situation et des conditions de vie des Afro-Brésiliens à Rio de Janeiro. Ce mouvement demande à l'État et à la société brésilienne de reconnaître les conditions misérables dans lesquelles les esclaves ont été laissés après l'abolition de l'esclavage, mais aussi la contribution des esclaves à la construction de la société, de l'économie et de la culture brésiliennes et enfin le racisme dont les Afro-Brésiliens sont encore l'objet. Aujourd'hui, des décisions juridiques tendent à favoriser une égalité effective, permettant ainsi l'émergence d'une image positive de la culture afro-brésilienne. This article discusses the difference between the official account on the memory of slavery in Brazil and how contemporary black movement's leaders, notably in Rio de Janeiro, see the Afro-Brazilians' situation and living conditions. This movement, which seeks to reveal in public space the memory of slavery and its consequences, claims Brazilian State and society to recognize not only the miserable conditions under which former slaves were left after the abolition of slavery, but the contribution of the slaves to the construction of Brazilian society, economy and culture and also that Afro-Brazilians are still the object of racism. If in today's Brazil, the public debate on reparations comprises a legal aspect of rectification, by creating measures aiming to provide effective equality, this discussion also takes the form of symbolic fight, in which one of the objectives is to build a positive image of the Afro-Brazilian culture. In Brasilien weicht die offizielle Berichterstattung über die Wahrnehmung der Sklaverei vor allem in Bezug auf die Situation und Lebensbedingungen der Afro-Brasilianer in Rio de Janeiro stark ab von der Sichtweise der Führer der zeitgenössischen « Schwarzen-Bewegung ». Die Bürgerbewegung forde~<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i383702<br>
Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: La pratique de l'observation avec une caméra se développe de plus en plus lors des enquêtes ethnographiques. Or, l'observation filmée ne consiste pas tant à traduire en image ce que l'on observe, mais surtout à savoir être là – face à l'autre – afin d'observer en tant qu'on filme. Il s'agit donc d'une posture singulière que nous définirons par le terme d'observation filmante, de même que l'observation participante définit une certaine pratique ethnographique. Mais, l'acte de filmer radicalise le rapport au « terrain » : que signifie représenter une situation dite « réelle » ? Comment deux personnes peuvent-elles accepter la présence d'un tiers qui rend compte de leurs échanges alors que ce qui se dit n'est pas prévu pour être publiquement représenté ? À partir de ces interrogations, cet article examine les conditions de l'observation filmée dans la mesure où cette pratique relève d'une relation sociale spécifique entre filmant et filmé. The practice of observing with a camera is becoming ever more frequent in ethnological fieldwork. A filmed observation is not so much the work of turning what is being observed into an image but, more importantly, the job of knowing how to be present, facing others, while filming. This very special stance is defined by the phrase « filming observation », in line with participant observation, another ethnological practice. The action of filming radicalizes relations with the « field ». What does a portrayal of a real situation mean ? How do two persons accept the presence of a third party who is filming their exchanges whenever what is being said is not intended for public presentation ? These questions serve to examine the conditions for a « filming observation » insofar as this practice refers to a specific social relation between the one filming and those being filmed.<br>

Abstract: This article addresses the woman teller's identity in the literary fairy tales of France. The author rereads prefaces and images that scholars have used to demonstrate the woman teller's literarity to argue rather for her "frivolity," a word the women themselves use to describe their writing. The essay finds that frivolity is an aesthetic principle at the heart of the women's poetic project that marks their difference from even the Modern partisans of the great literary debate. The principle of frivolity is captured in an image that recurs in prefaces by the writers: the "modern" fairy.<br>

Article Title: The Detraditionalization of Intimacy Reconsidered<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i388289<br>
Date: 9 1, 1999<br>
Author(s): Wilson Neil<br>
Abstract: This essay challenges those strains of contemporary social theory that regard romantic/sexual intimacy as a premier site of detraditionalization in the late modern era. Striking changes have occurred in intimacy and family life over the last half-century, but the notion of detraditionalization as currently formulated does not capture them very well. With the goal of achieving a more refined understanding, the article proposes a distinction between "regulative" and "meaning-constitutive" traditions. The former involve threats of exclusion from various moral communities; the latter involve linguistic and cultural frameworks within which sense is made of the world. Focusing on the U.S. case and marshaling various kinds of empirical evidence, the article argues that while the regulative tradition of what it terms lifelong, internally stratified marriage has declined in strength in recent years, the image of the form of couplehood inscribed in this regulative tradition continues to function as a hegemonic ideal in many American intimate relationships. Intimacy in the United States also remains beholden to the tradition of romantic love. That these meaning-constitutive traditions continue to play a central role in structuring contemporary intimacy suggests that detraditionalization involves the relative decline only of certain regulative traditions, a point that calls into question some of the normative assessments that often accompany the detraditionalization thesis.<br>

Abstract: This paper considers how companies use their own mass communication media to create, with the aid of metaphors, a legitimizing image of their practices. The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.<br>

Abstract: Ce texte propose un examen de la figure d'Eva Perón, épouse du président populiste de l'Argentine, Juan Perón, comme icône de l'identité argentine. Elle est récupérée comme un espace d'identification inéluctable dans l'imaginaire politique national et la représentation que l'on se fait d'elle varie selon la conjoncture et les acteurs en jeu. L'« Evita populiste » incarne une image maternelle de protection des secteurs populaires, tandis que l'« Evita Montonera » et l'« Evita piquetera » dessinent les contours d'un profil révolutionnaire. Qu'en est-il alors de l'appropriation que fait la Présidente actuelle de l'Argentine, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner? Ce travail a comme but d'examiner la spécificité des différentes lectures du mythe et de montrer que loin d'avoir diminuée, l'importance de cette figure reste fondamentale dans les manières de faire encore aujourd'hui de la politique en Argentine. Este texto propone un análisis de la figura de Eva Perón, esposa del presidente populista de la Argentina, Juan Perón, como ícono de la identidad argentina. Dicha figura se constituye en un espacio de identificación ineluctable para el imaginario político nacional, pero las representaciones que se construyen varían en función de la coyuntura política y de los actores involucrados. La "Eva populista" encarna una imagen maternal y protectora de los sectores populares, mientras que la "Evita montonera" y la "Evita piquetera" evocan un perfil revolucionario. ¿Que tipo de apropiación propone la Presidente actual de la Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner? Este trabajo tiene como objetivo examinar la especificidad de las diferentes lecturas del mito y mostrar que lejos de haberse disipado, la importancia de esta figura continua marcando la forma actual de hacer política en Argentina.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Article Title: Stanislaw Lem's Fantastic Ocean: Toward a Semantic Interpretation of "Solaris"<br>
Publisher: SF-TH Inc.<br>
Issue: i394183<br>
Date: 7 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Theweleit Manfred<br>
Abstract: Stanislaw Lem's "Solaris" vividly embodies the problems surrounding the semantic status of fantastic utterances. It poses the problems as two related questions: what is the "objective" meaning of the notion of the Solarian ocean for the Solarist researchers in the novel, and what is the "symbolic" meaning of the novel's fantastic ocean for its readers. Since the diegetic planet Solaris has no objective relation to the meaning-producing dynamics of human work, the Solarian ocean is a projection of familiar human meanings. As for the fantastic ocean represented for the reader, it can be approached via several semantic interpretations, none of which are fully adequate. Three such approaches are the plasmatic, i.e., the different descriptions of the ocean are instances of the dominant metasemic lexeme "plasma"; the vaginal, i.e., the ocean is a displaced image of female sexuality; and the schizophrenic, i.e., the ocean is an instance of a schizophrenic "miraculation-machine" (derived from Deleuze-Guattari's Anti-Oedipus).<br>

Abstract: This article deals with the problem of text and ¡ mage in contemporary art, as exemplified in a photograph by Jeff Wall called The Storyteller (1986). This image is analysed, taking as reference Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe as well as Walter Benjamin's essay of 1936 on the subject of the narrator. The main points in this comparative analysis are the role of the narrator both in text and image, oral tradition versus visual space, the concept of the picture and the tradition of story representation. The author proposes the idea that modernity introduced a major change in the art of storytelling and in the narrative function of image.<br>

Article Title: Julius Nyerere à Zanzibar: Père ou ennemi de la nation ?<br>
Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i40105000<br>
Date: 6 1, 2013<br>
Author(s): Fouéré Marie-Aude<br>
Abstract: Julius Nyerere a joué un rôle essentiel dans l'union de Zanzibar et de l'ancien Tanganyika, qui a formé la Tanzanie. Pére de la nation tanzanienne, son image est cependant toute différente chez les nationalistes de Zanzibar, qui en font un étranger et un adversaire. En dépliant ce discours nationaliste, Marie-Aude Fouéré brosse en creux et par petites touches le portait de Nyerere à Zanzibar et montre qu'un père de l'indépendance peut surtout être perçu comme un ennemi dans la périphérie d'un nouvel État. Un récit collectif dépréciatif sur le premier président de Tanzanie, Julius Nyerere, se difruse aujourd'hui dans les îles de Zanzibar. Au regard de la trajectoire mémorielle de Julius Nyerere en Tanzanie continentale, caractérisée par une constante surenchère de déférence, Zanzibar fait figure d'exception. L'article présente les termes de ce récit péjoratif sur Nyerere en rapport à deux épisodes centraux dans l'histoire des îles: la révolution de 1964, mythe de la nation zanzibarie libre et souveraine, et l'Union avec le Tanganyika. Il montre aussi comment ce récit dépréciatif entre en résonance avec la question musulmane qui, à Zanzibar, est consubstantielle à un positionnement identitaire collectif. L'article conclut que, dans une société sans père de la nation ni récit national unifié, Julius Nyerere constitue un récit de la nation en négatif. A derogatory collective narrative around the first President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, circulates in the islands of Zanzibar today. Against Nyerere's ever more deferential memorial trajectory in mainland Tanzania, Zanzibar stands out as an exception. This article presents the outline of this pejorative account of Nyerere in relation to two major events in the history of the Isles: the Revolution of 1964, myth of a free and sovereign Zanzibari nation; and the Union with Tanganyika. It also shows how this derogatory narrative is connected to the Muslim question which, in Zanzibar, amounts to a collective identity position~<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117559<br>
Date: 6 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): LEBRUN Jocelyne<br>
Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: « Le dédoublement ainsi ébauché dans le sujet, c'est l'identification au frere qui lui per-
met de s'achever: elle fournit l'image qui fixe l'un des pôles du masochisme primaire. [...]
L'identification affective est une fonction psychique dont la psychanalyse a établi l'originalité,
spécialement dans le complexe d'Œdipe, comme nous le verrons. Mais l'emploi de ce terme au
stade que nous étudions reste mal défini dans la doctrine; c'est à quoi nous avons tenté de sup-
pléer par une théorie de cette identification dont nous désignons le moment génétique sous le
terme de stade du miroir » (op. cit., p. 40).<br>

Abstract: The persecution, flight and murder of European Jews in the first half of the twentieth century and the profound social and political transformations that decisively affected European cities in the final decade of the 20th century have radically altered urban 'Jewish landscapes'. New stakeholders and institutions emerged with their own networks, goals and interests, and have constructed, staged and marketed 'Jewish culture' anew. The resultant Jewish spaces are being constituted in an urban space located at the intersection of ethnic representation, collective memory, and drawing on an imagined material culture, which includes architectural, physical and digital spaces (e.g. synagogues, Jewish quarters). This Europe-wide process is closely related to the delicate politics of memory and to discourses on the authenticity of cities. This article analyses how the image of 'Jewishness' plays an increasingly important role in the marketing of historical authenticity that cities and their tourism affiliates are undertaking.<br>

Publisher: Middle East Institute<br>
Issue: i399456<br>
Date: 7 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Heradstveit G. Matthew<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the Axis of Evil metaphor that was used by President George W. Bush in his State of the Union Address in 2002 to represent Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. After describing "axis" as a metonym for fascism and Nazism, and "evil" as a metonym for Satanic forces that implies an alliance of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea that is collectively responsible for evil deeds, the authors analyze the impact of this metaphor on Iranian self-image and politics. The data for this analysis are drawn from in-depth interviews conducted with 18 members of the Iranian oppositional elite. The interview results suggest that the Axis of Evil metaphor had an impact on political discourse in Iran and strengthened the rhetorical position of conservatives vis-à-vis reformers by reviving militant revolutionary language with the Great Satan (the United States) as the main target of the theocratic and conservative forces. The article concludes with some observations about the implications of using cultural and historical experiences for explaining differences between the ways in which Americans (and other people in the West) and Iranians have understood the metaphor.<br>

Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132187<br>
Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commence par definir ce qu'est un « protestant » et ce qu'est un « intellectuel ». Puis il s'ttache à retracer la démarche d'un certain nombre d'intellectuels protestants en deux temps, avant et après 1914. Pour chacune de ces periodes il présente les lieux d'expression des intellectuels protestants, les principales figures et, enfin, il retrace leurs thèmes de réflexions. Cela lui permet de proposer une sorte de « type idéal » de l'intellectuel protestant durant les années 1870-1914; pour les annees 1914-1940 l'image de ces intellectuels est plus éclatée puisqu'ils se voient dans l'obligation de repenser leur place dans une société française déstabilisée par la guerre. The article begins with definitions of « Protestant » and of « intellectual ». It then traces the activities of a certain number of Protestant intellectuals in two periods, before and after 1914. For each of these periods, the channels of communication used by Protestant intellectuals, the leading figures and, finally, the major intellectual preoccupations are presented. What emerges is a sort of « ideal type » of Protestant intellectual during the period 1870-1914; for the Years 1914-1940 the image of the intellectuals is more diversified, since they find themselves obliged to rethink their place within a French society destabilized by the war. Dieser Beitrag wird mit einer Begriffsbestimmung eröffnet : Was ist ein « Protestant », was ist ein « Intellektueller ». Sodann wird der Entwicklung einiger protestantischer Intellektueller im Zeitraum vor und nach 1914 nachgegangen. Für beide werden die Orte und die Personen, die wichtige Rolle gespielt haben, und schließlich die Themen ihres Nachdenkens beschrieben. So gelingt es, eine Art Idealtyp des protestantischen Intellektuellen während der Zeit von 1870-1914 vorzustellen, während dies für die Jahre von 1914-1940 erheblich schwieriger ist : Das Bild der Intellektuellen ist in dieser Periode erheblich vielfaltiger, da sie ihre Stellung in e~<br>

Abstract: The relations between language and imagery are addressed by cross referencing Lacan and James Hillman, along with Mead, Geschwind, and Gibson. Not only is neither symbolic frame reducible to the other, but neither can be rooted in perceptual capacities that would be distinct from or more "primitive" than the other. Outside of specific theoretical agendas that would analyze one by simplifying the other, word and image are co-emergent and co-dependent expressions of the inherent openness of the human mind.<br>

Issue: i401008<br>
Date: 1 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): Veyne Achille<br>
Abstract: Ce texte analyse l'image comme écriture, non seulement parce que la caricature camerounaise est un parfait mélange de l'image et du mot, du mot et du son (donc de la parole), mais aussi parce qu'elle s'immisce constamment dans l'espace pictural pour y introduire le mouvement. Elle est aussi politiquement un métissage du local et du global par son français créole, par son insistance à mettre l'accent sur les mécanismes, situés dans l'espace politique global, qui agissent sur les événements locaux. La caricature semble s'identifier à une rumeur saisie sur le vif qui, pour ne pas devenir mot discipliné, a absolument besoin de l'image pour continuer à être un événement, pour échapper au risque de devenir le double de la vie qui se présente comme son portrait. L'esthétique de cette écriture, qui s'obstine à faire de l'indiscipline le fondement de sa pertinence, repose essentiellement sur l'audace de dire, de montrer, ce qui ne devrait être ni dit, ni montré publiquement. Toutes choses que la caricature peut se permettre puisque, comme la rumeur, elle ne prétend pas reproduire le monde de façon mimétique; elle n'en produit qu'un double dont l'éthique permet de montrer ce que tout le monde sait mais que personne n'ose dire. /// Cameroonian caricatures are analyzed as a form of writing that mixes images and words. Through French Creole, these caricatures politically mix local and general issues by insisting on how politics in general affects the image to become an event. The aesthetics of this form of writing, which obstinately insists on indiscipline as the basis of its relevance, mainly resides in the boldness to speak up about, and show, what should neither be said nor shown in public. Caricatures can do this because, like rumors, they do not claim to reproduce the world through mimesis. They only produce a double for showing what everyone knows but no one dares say.<br>

Abstract: Pour expliquer le suicide des agriculteurs, les médias se limitent généralement au seul facteur économique. Une approche comprehensive de cette question révèle d'autres conditions objectives de production de ce qu'on peut appeler la « souffrance sociale ». Le déséquilibre structurel entre l'organisation prescrite et l'organisation réelle du travail génère chez les agriculteurs un sentiment de pénibilité mentale. Tenus de répondre à des impératifs d'autonomie et de réalisation de soi, ces derniers ne disposent pas tous des mêmes ressources sociales pour parvenir à une image positive d'eux-mêmes. Pour se développer, la souffrance suicidaire s'appuie en effet sur la distribution inégale du capital économique, culturel et d'autochtonie. When explaining suicide among farmers, the media tend to focus exclusively on economic factors. This paper argues that adopting a more comprehensive approach to the issue highlights other conditions of production of what might be termed "social suffering". It is suggested that the structural imbalance between the prescribed and actual organization of work causes mental pain among farmers. The paper argues that amid increasing pressure to demonstrate greater autonomy and self-realization, farmers may not have the same social resources for developing a positive self-image. Research shows that an unequal distribution of economic and cultural capital and capital of autochtony leads to increased suicidal thoughts.<br>

Abstract: La Sagesse personnifiée en Pr 9 est tenue pour une figure féminine. Cette interprétation ne se trouve toutefois pas corroborée par l'étude du chapitre, pas plus que par l'examen des autres passages du livre présentant la Sagesse personnifiée (1,20-33; 8), ou des sept premiers chapitres à l'atmosphère sexuelle et sexuée pourtant prégnante. La Sagesse n'en est pas pour autant masculine: à l'image de Dieu, elle excède toute sexuation. Personified Wisdom in Pr 9 is considered as a feminine figure. This interpretation is nervertheless corroborated neither by the study of this chapter, nor by the analysis of the other passages of the book presenting Personified Wisdom (1,20-33; 8), or of the first seven chapters in which the sexual and gendering atmospher is nevertheless emphasized. However, Wisdom is not masculine: as God, it exceeds all sexual identity.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires du Mirail<br>
Issue: i40184874<br>

Author(s): DEJEUMONT Catherine<br>
Abstract: La ville de Münster, en Westphalie, abrita en 1534-35 une communauté anabaptiste dont on ne connaît souvent que certains traits : son écrasement par les forces « de la réaction », sa réforme du mariage qui défraya la chronique ou la prépondérance des femmes dans sa population..., parfois associés dans l'image d'une société révolutionnaire, libertaire, dans lesquelles les femmes avaient un grand rôle – qu'en est-il de ces idées reçues ? Après un bref rappel de ce qu'est l'anabaptisme et de ce que fut cet épisode dans l'histoire de la Réforme, l'auteur analyse le texte justifiant l'instauration de la polygamie, ainsi que son traitement par l'historiographie et tente par ce biais de rétablir les faits dans leur contexte. In 1534-35, the city of Münster in Westphalia was ruled by Anabaptists. For later generations, this episode has often been reduced to a few aspects, e.g. their defeat by the "forces of reaction', their scandalous reform of marriage, or the large proportion of women in the community. These are often combined to create the image of a revolutionary and 'women-friendly' community. After a brief survey of the history of Anabaptism and a brief presentation of the changes which occurred in Münster, the author analyses the text which justified the practice of polygamy, as well as the historiographical treatment of these events, and thus tries to situate the events in their context.<br>

Abstract: Appliquée au monothéisme trinitaire, cette étude de théologie spéculative se donne un double fondement Elle reçoit la relation de réciprocité entre Jésus-Christ et l'Esprii Saint, telle qu'elle est élaborée par diverses théologies contemporaines de la Révélation et du Salut Elle confirme une autre relation de réciprocité, entre une vérité de manifestation et une vérité de communication, telle qu'elle a pu être éprouvée à travers une réflexion conduite précédemment sur le langage. De cet entrecroisement suit la détermination de l'Esprii comme le Don incréé-indicible, et du Christ comme l'Icône-Parole incréée. Recueillant le Discours du Calvaire et la Parole de Pâques le dédoublement du nom christologique contribue à distinguer la médiation divine du milieu divin. Si la réciprocité du Christ et de l'Esprit rapporte ainsi le Mystère de Dieu à l'unité du Père et de la Révélation, il conviendra de revenir sur les anciens concepts de relation et d'origine, l'un et l'autre étant désormais respectivement accordés à la communication et à la manifestation. Applied to trinitarian monotheism, this study of speculative theology is based on a double foundation. It takes the relationship of reciprocity between Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit as elaborated by various contemporary theologies of revelation and salvation. It confirms another reciprocal relationship, that which exists between a truth of manifestation and a truth of communication as it has been previously established through a reflection on language. From this it follows that the Holy Spirit is the inexpressible, uncreated Gift while Christ is the uncreated Word-Image. Combining the discourse of Calvary and the Message of Easter, the double christological name helps to distinguish the divine mediation from the divine milieu. If the reciprocity of Christ and the Spirit thus relate the mystery of God to the unity of the Father and revelation, then it would be fitting to go back to the ancient concepts of relation and ori~<br>

Author(s): NeutresAbstract: En adaptant Le Parrain, le best-seller de Mario Puzo, Francis Ford Coppola est confronté à plusieurs récits-I'histoire de la Mafia américaine, son imagerie mythique, I'interrogation identitaire italo-américaine-, auxquels il mêle des souvenirs personnels et l'héritage culturel légué par sa communauté. Dépassant la simple commande commerciale, il réussit à établir à l'écran, via la fiction, sa part de vérité. Le premier film sera complété par deux suites. Le temps de constitution de cette trilogie, près de vingt ans, renvoie à deux autres durées exceptionnellement longues: la durée du métrage final des trois films (près de neufheures) et celle de la période décrite (quatre-vingt ans de l'histoire des États-Unis). Brisant la linéarité classique, la trilogie du Parrain souligne la pertinence de l'outil cinématographique dans la construction d'un récit aux temporalités multiples. Ces temporalités concernent aussi bien le spectateur que le cinéaste lui-même, comme nous l'indique l'édition DVD, outil précieux pour une analyse historienne. Face à ses propres images, Coppola transforme la «revision» en travail de mémoire: manière supplémentaire de surmonter l'apparent paradoxe entre le film hollywoodien et le récit intime. /// Whilst adapting The Godfather, Mario Puzo's bestselling novel, Francis Ford Coppola was faced with several stories-the history of the American Mafia, the mythical image associated with it, the questioning of Italian-American identity-which he managed to combine with his own life experiences and the cultural legacy inherited from his own community. Going beyond a simple commissioned film, he succeeds in transposing onto screen, through fiction, his very own truth. This first installment was complemented by two sequels. The twenty-year time-frame within which this trilogy was made is echoed by two other remarkably long periods: the full running-time of the three films when viewed consecutively (close to nine hours) and the historical period within which~<br>

Issue: i224978<br>
Date: 12 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Adorno Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Author(s): Wikan Janice<br>
Abstract: Examination of cultural and social factors surrounding zar spirit possession diagnoses in Northern Sudan suggests that a major issue addressed by the cult is the cultural overdetermination of women's selfhood. Circumcision and infibulation operate to establish in women a sense of self congruent with the cultural image of woman as reproducer. When experiences and expectations fail to mesh, some women fall ill and are ultimately diagnosed as possessed. Through acceptance of the possession diagnosis and participation in curing rites involving trance, a patient is given scope to expand and regenerate her sense of self and recontextualize her experiences.

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i226398<br>
Date: 11 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Zambouke Charles<br>
Abstract: In this study of Greek dreams at moments of illness and anxiety I explore the relationship between individual experience and cultural representation. Ethnographic data and textual sources show that the image of fields recurs in dreams, thus throwing into question the uniqueness of personal experience as well as the concept of "experience" as something separate from cultural narratives. Yet these same images might also be independently generated "from below" by the emotional, physical experience of distress and illness. This case points to the convergence of cultural and personal symbols and to their fusion in the moment of experience. Approaches from psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and folklore studies all provide possible theorizations. None of these options excludes the others. The image of the field in dreams is overdetermined precisely because the historicocultural, the cognitive, the psychobiological, and the social all simultaneously figure in human experience.

Abstract: 'Positivism,' it seems, is a movement that cultural anthropology can do without. But what is positivism, who are these positivists, and what precisely are their sins? Notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, the image of positivism in cultural anthropology is comparatively coherent and the criticism directed at it relatively well founded. What is dubious is the conclusion to which many critics think it leads: that the methods of the natural sciences are inappropriate to the study of human culture and society.<br>

Abstract: October 17th, 2011. In the Parisian region and the neighbouring suburbs of the Hauts-de-Seine, the 50th commemoration of the massacre of Algerians in Paris led to the institutionalization of the colonial memory. By virtue of their duration and their size, these commemorative ceremonies questioned the particular period during which the French colonial past appeared in former and present socialist and communist councils. In Nanterre – a commune situated in the North-western suburbs of Paris that has had a communist council since 1935 – this memory is exceptional due to its long colonial and postcolonial history. Although the largest Algerian slum in France was to be found in the Nanterre of the 1950s and 1960s, for many years, the council remained completely silent about the massacre of Algerian activists in 1961. It is only recently that the massacre has started to be commemorated in Nanterre. This can be explained by two significant and recent transformations of the city: firstly, its demographic and urban transformation; and secondly, the change of its political elite, following a boom in the number of local associations and activist networks working on the question of the local (and colonial) memory. The emergence of this memory in the micro-politics of Nanterre responds to the need for a common and unified identity of its residents, an identity that the working class and communist banners have failed to provide. The residents’ struggle to have a school named after the Algerian sociologist Abdelmalek Sayad – who wrote on Nanterre’s slums – and a street named after Abdennbi Guémiah – a teenager killed by a racist neighbour in the early 1980s – testify to the need for such a memory. The heritage and memory of immigration in the city has now become a core issue in Nanterre’s local politics. It helps political authorities build a brandnew image and overcome the mistakes of the past by recognizing its (post)colonial citizens. Beyond the dead and the words, the sudden e~<br>

Author(s): Wolf Larry D.<br>
Abstract: Since the founding of this nation, the theater metaphor has had an influence on political discourse. Politicians often invoke the metaphor when they enact political dramas to construct themselves in the image of leader. An argument is presented that former President Ronald Reagan and his political strategists made extensive use of this strategy and were effective in portraying public administrators as evil villains. It is also argued that supporters of the administrative state relied on the theater metaphor as well. In an effort to counter Reagan's negative image of villain, supporters responded by portraying public administrators as heroes and innocent victims. This article suggests that the theater metaphor is problematic when viewed from the perspective of public administration theory and practice. The images of villain, hero and innocent victims emanating from the theater metaphor are troublesome and deserve scrutiny.<br>

Abstract: Kurata Hyakuzō’s
         The Priest and His Disciples(Shukke to sono deshi, 1916) contributed to the unprecedented rise of religious literature during the Taishō period. The development of the Japanese religious world and the growing interests in religion by Japanese intellectuals during this period encouraged Kurata to humanize Shinran and paved the way forThe Priest and His Disciplesto become a bestseller. AlthoughThe Priest and His Disciplesis much studied, the role of fiction played in the work based on the life of a medieval Buddhist priest remains unexplored. This study first provides a background toThe Priest and His Disciplesand explains why it aroused such interest at the time. It then treats the image of Shinran at the intersection of history and fiction by referring to the study of Michel de Certeau and investigates how Kurata constructed an image of Shinran as the “other” inThe Priest and His Disciplesand placed it in history and in legends about Shinran.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on a selection of chronicles in which José Donoso provides a denaturalized image of the city of Santiago in the 1980s. By stressing a poetics of transformation, the author narrates a city that confronts the silence pervading its urban practices and neighbourhoods. Under this guise, Donoso’s writing tactically articulates a voice for the city that challenges both the homogeneity imposed by traditional renditions and the order of a contemporary oligarchy.<br>

Author(s): Carlson Celia<br>
Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: The academic study of Kabbalah has largely been limited to myth and symbol as the two viable forms of kabbalistic discourse. In this essay, I resist those limitations and explore two other possible literary forms: history and fiction. I do not mean history in any positivistic sense but closer to Steven Greenblatt's description of new historicism as cultural poetics. This suggests that literature not only reflects a historical setting but also creates that setting, constructing reality in its own image and directing it toward its desired ends. In looking at Lurianic Kabbalah as fiction, I raise the issue of the “real” and the “true” as it relates to fictive narratives more generally. This essay does not claim that the kabbalists in question did or did not intend to write cultural poetics or fiction. Rather, I use cultural poetics and fiction as possible lenses through which a nontraditional interested reader (i.e., one not invested in the literature as authoritative) can read these texts in a way that can speak to the contemporary world in which we live and think.<br>

Abstract: It is not new for poets to renovate the language of poetry by appropriating or sending up enervated, devalued language as a way to critique discourses of power. It may even be one of the oldest methods of literary innovation, considering the Roman appropriation of Greek literature. But some contemporary, experimental poets explicitly link mass production of capitalist consumer products and the logic of the copy
         
               to the production of art in a Benjaminian vein. De la Torre refers to the age of mechanical reproduction in an epigraph to “Photos While U Wait,” which she borrows from Jacques Barzun's introduction to Gustave Flaubert's110
            Dictionary of Accepted Ideas: “The cliché, as its name indicates, is the metal plate that reproduces the same image mechanically without end.”
               Poems written under constraint and composed of recombined, appropriated text at times thematize the activity of appropriation itself as endemic to capitalism. The supermarket is a popular trope for the destruction of authenticity, disenfranchisement, and advertising's interpellation of the subject. A discursive tone dotted with imperatives mark these poems, as they echo the language of consumerism. African American poet Harryette Mullen's111
            S*PeRM**K*T, included in herRecyclopedia, is structured according to the logic of supermarket aisles (“sort of like your shopping list”), and the missing letters in its title spell outu are, as in, “you are what you eat,” as Mullen explains in an author's note. “I was thinking about domestication, about the role of women, women as consumers, women having supposed power as consumers but also being disempowered in other ways…. You can't necessarily buy who you really want to be. You have to buy the available images,” she writes in an accompanying statement.
               Mullen, like Hayes, also connects her poetics to that of a woman poet predecessor. Her books112

Abstract: Fitzgerald's nostalgic style, though, set an example of how a nostalgic narrative could be structured, and in its aftermath it was used by such different authors as Evelyn Waugh in
      Brideshead Revisited(1945), Anthony Burgess inA Clockwork Orange(1962) and the works of Kazuo Ishiguro. The author's own later work employs it as well. The technique of using the reader's textual memory in order to evoke a phenomenological nostalgic experience is very evident in both versions ofTender Is the Night(the 1934 original, and Malcolm Cowley's 1951 restructuring). In the 1951 version, the structure of the narrative closely follows the pattern of happiness and reflection. An early description of a Swiss valley communicates an awe of life and nature: “The sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly it was a Swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer” (9). In the transitory third book, “Casualties: 1925,” the tone has changed from appreciative to melancholic, as in this description of the small town of Amiens: “In the day-time one is deflated by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years ago crossing the great grey cobble-stoned squares in front of the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs” (138). At the end of the novel both Dick and Nicole Diver become obsessed with youth and the past as well as with time: “for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty” (228). Toward the end of the novel, Nicole's last sight of Dick—“her eyes followed his figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots in the summer crowd” (386)—forces the reader to reflect in a reversed movement. Instead of vanishing like Dick, this image suggests a backward recollection of what was a Swiss valley “at its best.”<br>

Abstract: The River Is Risingis, among Jabbeh Wesley's four collections, the one most directly occupied with the memories of the dead by making an urgent moral plea. The poet provides specific details of the Liberian wars, incidents, and even names that ultimately confer humanity on places and incidents and therefore bring them closer to the reader's axis of empathy. In the title poem, “The River Is Rising,” the image of a river stands for the ebb and flow of memory. The speaker announces to us that the river is “swelling with the incoming tide,” and people, the speaker included, “stand at the banks” as witnesses to what the rising river will bring.

Article Title: What Is Africa to Me?<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jafrireli.1.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 1 1, 2013<br>
Abstract: The 1971 article focused on three major points: (1) Africa as historical reality and religious image; (2) the involuntary presence of the African American community in the United States; and (3) the experience and symbol of God in the experience of blacks; these points overlap. I pointed out how Africa for African Americans was obviously a reference to the continent of Africa but that it was that and more. It became an image and symbol for the possibility for another and alternative beginning and way of being in the world. Africa was indeed a continent with a very large landmass and simultaneously the basis for a powerful orienting discourse about the nature and being of peoples of African descent in the world. The involuntary stance and presence of African people in their diasporic existence in the New World is paralleled by the destruction of aboriginal peoples and acquisition of their lands. These events have prevented any ultimate trust in the rhetorics of egalitarianism and freedom that accompanied the ascendancy of Europe. The manifestation and naming of gods and divine beings as centering symbols of the orientational process express themselves in a precise manner within this situation and become the resource for the maintenance of one's humanity within the context.<br>

Article Title: American Continental Philosophy in the Making:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Here is part of what I meant when I said that the early meetings were theoretically disorganized. There was no mainstream of American Continental philosophy, no orthodoxy, and on our side at least, no bright red line between what was philosophy and what was not. The pervasive mood was youthful and inclusive—and so, exactly the sort of atmosphere where novices could find their own voices. From this unsynthesizable disarray of speakers and attendees, I learned to assume that just about anything, even mathematical and logical things, can be treated phenomenologically—indeed perhaps especially when tradition tells us not to. Yet I also learned that no one can ever be entirely sure about the best way to address the things themselves, even when we have them in our sights. In one of the earliest meetings—I think it may have been the fourth—I remember attending an evening seminar on phenomenology and natural science, where the speakers were Theodore Kisiel, Patrick Heelan, and van Fraassen. Except for the fact that they are all white males, I retain an image of their discussion as modeling what the study of science as a human practice will eventually be, when traditionally trained epistemologists have stopped writing most of the textbooks and nobody reads the Leiter report. As Heidegger quips, we should always strive to treat phenomena phenomenologically. It seemed that for the most part, we understood this point without assuming we had already found the best way to do it. In this situation, hearing many disparate voices helped.

Abstract: There are perceptible changes in the orientation of SPEP papers in the 1960s. The eleven papers from the first two programs that James Edie edited and published in 1965 range within the phenomenological/existential area from issues of perception, lifeworld, and Husserlian horizons to authentic existence, solitude, and avoidance of the void.
         
               The next three meetings broadened the range of topics considerably by featuring papers that connected phenomenology to artificial intelligence, natural science, linguistics, schizophrenia, body image, social roles, tragedy, the experience of the holy, Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein. A new person in the European scene, Jacques Derrida, was invited to the fifth conference, but he was unable to attend (he sent a mimeographed copy of his paper that was available in French for those at the conference who might wish to read it).1<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Interestingly, we have reached a curious state of déjà vu. If SPEP was very much the work of John Wild, and if Wild followed a trajectory from realism to phenomenology, we are today seeing a movement in reverse, from phenomenology back to realism. Furthermore the later theological turn, almost predictable from the implicit theological beginnings of Continental philosophy, has occasioned a turn toward an antireligion, toward a new atheism, a new modernism, and a new materialism, reminiscent of the debates about scientific realism when Wilfrid Sellars presented his views on the manifest image and the scientific image in the early years of SPEP. The new movement has gathered around Quentin Meillassoux's
            After Finitude.
                  Meillassoux, a student of Badiou's, makes two charges. First is “correlationism”: Continental philosophy from Kant to the present is inherently subjectivistic and antirealist and makes nonsense of modern science (the premise that provoked the Alan Sokal ruse).26
               
                  The villain of the piece is Kant's perversion of the Copernican Revolution, wherein Kant reinstated the very anthropocentrism destroyed by Copernicus. Second is “fideism”: when Kant said that he found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith, he laid the ground for the theological turn. He invented the God of the gaps. He turned philosophy into a kind of apologetics that delimits the natural sciences and leaves the barn door wide open, through which theology makes an easy escape. Phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction are just so many versions of Kantian idealism under another name, constituting the dark damp soil in which the poisonous mushrooms of theology take root. If the theological turn is where Continental philosophy leads us, the young critics seem to say, that is the last straw, its reductio ad absurdum!27<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: It is plain to see that, in making this move, Janicaud is trying to align hermeneutic phenomenology with the theological turn of phenomenology whose ontotheological underpinnings were identified in his earlier work. But the question remains: Is this critique of hermeneutic phenomenology truly accurate? It is indeed the case that Ricoeur employs the image of the “graft” to characterize the relation between phenomenology and hermeneutics, but this only provides a partial account of his understanding of their relation. To be precise, it suggests that they only have a “thin” connection, so to speak, in which one is merely a supplement to the other. Yet, by turning to Ricoeur's essay “Phenomenology and Hermeneutics,” it becomes clear that their connection turns out to be more “thick” than Janicaud ever suspects.

Journal Title: Philosophy & Rhetoric<br>
Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to advance our understanding of how human agency supplies the fodder for public memories, thereby linking individuals and groups across time and perpetuating the memorial process. In order to accomplish this goal, I examine the work of philosopher Paul Ricoeur. I use his idea of “threefold mimesis” to develop a critical framework—the “agential spiral”—for reading examples of public memory. I argue that the concept of the agential spiral enables scholars to focus not only on the ways that memories unite human agents in the same temporal moment but also on how memories structure a relationship among agents across time through the performance and representation of agency. The image of a spiral highlights the cyclical yet potentially innovative process in which different agents (or groups of agents) at different points in time rhetorically reconstruct the past so that it can be productively appropriated by other agents. Unlike a circle, a spiral does not travel in precisely the same path but follows it in parallel motion, as one coil in a spring follows another. This framework foregrounds key agents in the process of creating public memories: those acting in history, those interpreting and fixing historical narratives, and those reading about or otherwise consuming these narratives. The spiral linking these agents would follow a general pattern: historical events occur, are recognized as significant “actions” and are recorded; historians, curators, memorialists, and other interpreters translate these events into explanatory narratives of human action; and readers, listeners, and other members of the public engage these narratives in order to understand the meaning of the past for the present. Then audience members become actors and contribute again to the cycle of interpreting and creatively imitating human action.<br>

Abstract: What to me is most striking about the Galen lab report is that it captures an unusually quiescent image of Shaw, a stasis that is discordant with our sense of him as a vivacious, frenetic blur during those first decades in London, what Archibald Henderson deems “the quintessence of vital energy.”
      
            Throughout most of his life, Shaw was an active walker, cyclist, and swimmer, not to mention a compulsive reader, writer, and speaker whose engagement with the world around him was marked by a robust, ferocious vigor. Shaw's use of language is itself acrobatic, his agile balancing of ideas, his graceful rhetorical athleticism across genres. In this sense, it is precisely his2
         sanus agitatusthat draws and sustains our interest, the rigor of his writing challenging us to keep up, work out, and stay in shape. In 1897, theVegetariannoted of Shaw that “in the pursuit of his duties he has to work frequently under most unhealthy conditions and to face all weathers yet any observant stranger would turn and take a second look at Shaw's virile figure in the street.”
            Indeed, more than a century later, we are still eagerly looking and, in some cases, still trying to catch up. Arguably, health was the fundamental preoccupation of Shaw's work, Shavianism's probiotic elixir the unifying thread of a prolific and expansive career.3<br>

Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 10 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Jacques Derrida, for example, tells of being asked by an American tourist in a Tokyo hotel whether there is a single definitive book. Derrida writes that he almost replied that “there are two of them,
         UlyssesandFinnegans Wake.”
               Derrida depicts112
            Finnegans Wakeas a “hypermnesiac machine”—one that contains all cultures, histories, languages, and literatures: “you can say nothing that is not programmed on this 1000th generation computer.”
               Derrida discovers divinity—113
            Yahweh—inFinnegans Wake; but there we might more pertinently also find Joyce'sYahoos: “truemen like yahoomen.”
               If all men are Yahoos—who are, as Swift emphasizes, creatures of deceit—then true men cannot be men of truth. Humanity no longer matches its divine self-image: “When is a man not a man? … [W]hen he is a … Sham.”114
            
               In its pragmatic reflection of material reality,115
            Finnegans Wakereveals its own idealizations as counterfeit. Thus Derrida comes to witness “the simulacrum of this forgery … the ruse of the invented word.”

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Something akin to this reconceptualization of Utopia as method is latent in philosopher Theodor Adorno's challenge that “architecture worthy of human beings thinks better of men than they actually are.”
      
               Implicit in this is the proposition that worthy architecture is less a problem of style, or image, or even form alone, than an issue of propriety, or appropriateness. However, in the current climate, extreme experimentalism prevails, taking shape as visionary or novel architecture, which seems more the product of the vagaries of fashion and the media than it is shaped around the bodily events or habits of its intended inhabitants. Reasonable as it may be to wish it otherwise, doing so articulates such a dissident position that the very12
            othernessthis asserts, in comparison to prevailing conditions, arguably reveals a utopian stance, in the sense that for architecture to change (for the better), everything that precedes it must change as well.

Abstract: This essay places before the reader four historic texts that raise significant questions for Jews and Christians who choose to enter into post-Holocaust examination of their respective identities and their relationships to their grounding traditions. The Kristallnacht exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum introduces museum visitors to the defaced Talmudic instruction of R. Eliezer—
         Know before whom you stand-which frames this essay. As with the story the museum recounts, more than texts are at stake in this essay, but the way forward is distinctly framed by their critical presence. In this case, the distinctive texts are faced in reconfiguring ways, asking those who face them to rethink the place of the other in their identities and life-orienting commitments. Early on, Samuel Bak's surrealistic rendering of a crucified, Jewish child provides a refracting image for exploring the questions these texts pose for post-Shoah people of faith who take their place before them, asking in recursive fashion: before whom do you stand?<br>
