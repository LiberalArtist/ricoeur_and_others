  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: Two forms of taxidermy predominate in the popular imagination: the type specimen in the natural history museum and the severed-head–style hunting trophy. In the case of the museum specimen, taxidermic animals stand in for their species; single animals serve as representatives of whole populations. In the tradition of the “Father of Modern Taxidermy” Carl Akeley, the aesthetic of the museum specimen minimizes differences between individuals (such as bullet wounds and other surface blemishes) to maximize an animal’s emblematic power; according to Donna Haraway, such taxidermy makes “nature true to type.”¹ In the case of hunting trophies, taxidermic animals represent<br>

  Abstract: As the title of this book,

The “South Seas” of my title is also the product of the European romantic imagination rather than an ethnographic or oceanographic category. In exploring the theme of cannibal talk I am deeply indebted to William Arens’s pioneering work,The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy. Writing many years later and<br>

  Abstract: When Ezra Pound wrote down the first of the three Imagistic principles, as seen in the epigraph, he was of course playing cards at the table of poetry rather than ethnography. What he meant by the “thing” was poetic matter that lives mostly in one’s imagination—an image. It really would be far-fetched to claim that a poem like “In a Station of the Metro” is a semantically ethnographic description of Oriental culture or race:<br>

  Abstract: For Christian believers, no one captivates the attention, moves the affections, or stirs the imagination like Jesus of Nazareth. He is the visible display—the perfect icon—of the inexhaustible love and power of an invisible God (Col. 1:15). What we know of this Jesus we have read in the writings of the New Testament. These first-century texts are the gateway to Christ, the “primary sources” on which we base our historical, theological, and practical beliefs about him. Through the theologically flavored biographies, ecclesial missives, and dreamlike visions contained within, we can get to know him and get a glimpse<br>

  Book Title: The Catholic Studies Reader-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): McGUINNESS MARGARET M.<br>
  Abstract: The Catholic Studies Reader is a rare book in an emerging field that has neither a documented history nor a consensus as to what should be a normative methodology. Dividing this volume into five interrelated themes central to the practice and theory of Catholic Studies-Sources and Contexts, Traditions and Methods, Pedagogy and Practice, Ethnicity, Race, and Catholic Studies, and The Catholic Imagination-the editors provide readers with the opportunity to understand the great diversity within this area of study. Readers will find informative essays on the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic social teaching, as well as reflections on the arts and literature. This provocative and enriching collection is valuable not only for scholars but also for lay and religious Catholics working in Catholic education in universities, high schools, and parish schools.<br>

  Book Title: Language, Eros, Being: Kabbalistic Hermeneutics and Poetic Imagination-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): WOLFSON ELLIOT R.<br>
  Abstract: This long-awaited, magisterial study-an unparalleled blend of philosophy, poetry, and philology-draws on theories of sexuality, phenomenology, comparative religion, philological writings on Kabbalah, Russian formalism, Wittgenstein, Rosenzweig, William Blake, and the very physics of the time-space continuum to establish what will surely be a highwater mark in work on Kabbalah. Not only a study of texts, Language, Eros, Being is perhaps the fullest confrontation of the body in Jewish studies, if not in religious studies as a whole.Elliot R. Wolfson explores the complex gender symbolism that permeates Kabbalistic literature. Focusing on the nexus of asceticism and eroticism, he seeks to define the role of symbolic and poetically charged language in the erotically configured visionary imagination of the medieval Kabbalists. He demonstrates that the traditional Kabbalistic view of gender was a monolithic and androcentric one, in which the feminine was conceived as being derived from the masculine. He does not shrink from the negative implications of this doctrine, but seeks to make an honest acknowledgment of it as the first step toward the redemption of an ancient wisdom.Comparisons with other mystical traditions-including those in Christianity, Buddhism, and Islam-are a remarkable feature throughout the book. They will make it important well beyond Jewish studies, indeed, a must for historians of comparative religion, in particular of comparative mysticism.Praise for Elliot R.

In this book, I have once again labored long in the orchard of kabbalistic texts to articulate philosophically the poetic imagination and hermeneutic orientation of the medieval Jewish esoteric lore. In great measure, my effort herein, reflective of my scholarly project since I began graduate school in 1980, has been impelled by a keen sense that kabbalah—not to speak of the spiritual comportment of Judaism more generally—<br>

  Book Title: Interstices of the Sublime: Theology and Psychoanalytic Theory-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: Interstices of the Sublime represents a powerful theological engagement with psychoanalytic theory in Freud, Lacan, Kristeva and Zizek, as well as major expressions of contemporary Continental philosophy, including Deleuze, Derrida, Marion, and Badiou. Through creative and constructive psycho-theological readings of topics such as sublimation, schizophrenia, God, and creation ex nihilo, this book contributes to a new form of radical theological thinking that is deeply involved in the world. Here the idea of the Kantian sublime is read into Freud and Lacan, and compared with sublimation. The sublime refers to a conflict of the Kantian faculties of reason and imagination, and involves the attempt to represent what is intrinsically unrepresentable. Sublimation, by contrast, involves the expression and partial satisfaction of primal desires in culturally acceptable terms. The sublime is negatively expressed in sublimation, because it is both the sourceof sublimation as well as that which resists being sublimated. That is, the Freudian sublime is related to the process of sublimation, but it also distorts or disrupts sublimation, and invokes what Lacan calls the Real. The effects of the sublime are not just psychoanalytic but, importantly, theological, because the sublime is the main form that Godtakes in the modern world. A radical postmodern theology attends to the workings of the sublime in our thinking and living, and provides resources to understand the complexity of reality. This book is one of the first sustained theological readings of Lacan in English.<br>

  Book Title: Debates in Continental Philosophy: Conversations with Contemporary Thinkers-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): KEARNEY RICHARD<br>
  Abstract: This important book brings together in one volume a collection of illuminating encounters with some of the most important philosophers of our age-by one of its most incisive and innovative critics.For more than twenty years, Richard Kearney has been in conversation with leading philosophers, literary theorists, anthropologists, and religious scholars. His gift is eliciting memorably clear statements about their work from thinkers whose writings can often be challenging in their complexity. Here, he brings together twenty-one originally published extraordinary conversations-his 1984 collection Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, his 1992 Visions of Europe: Conversations on the Legacy and Future of Europe, and his 1995 States of Mind: Dialogues with Contemporary Thinkers. Featured interviewees include Stanislas Breton, Umberto Eco, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Herbert Marcus, George Steiner, Julia Kristeva, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. To this classic core, he adds recent interviews, previously unpublished, with Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Jacques Derrida, and George DumZzil, as well as six colloquies about his own work.Wide-ranging and accessible, these interviews provide a fascinating guide to the ideas, concerns, and personalities of thinkers who have shaped modern intellec-tual life. This book will be an essential point of entry for students, teachers, scholars, and anyone seeking to understand contemporary culture.ContentsPrefacePart One: Recent DebatesJacques Derrida: Terror, Religion, and the New PoliticsJean-Luc Marion: The Hermeneutics of RevelationPaul Ricour: (a) On Life Stories (b) On The Crisis of Authority (c) The Power of the Possible (d) Imagination, Testimony, and TrustGeorges Dumzil: Myth, Ideology, SovereigntyPart Two: From Dialogues: The Phenomenological Heritage, 1984Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics of the InfiniteHerbert Marcuse: The Philosophy of Art and PoliticsPaul Ricour: (a) The Creativity of Language (b) Myth as the Bearer of Possib~<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Book Title: Phenomenologies of the Stranger: Between Hostility and Hospitality-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Caputo John D.<br>
  Abstract: What is strange? Or better, who is strange? When do we encounter the strange? We encounter strangers when we are not at home: when we are in a foreign land or a foreign part of our own land. From Freud to Lacan to Kristeva to Heidegger, the feeling of strangeness-das Unheimlichkeit-has marked our encounter with the other, even the other within our self. Most philosophical attempts to understand the role of the Stranger, human or transcendent, have been limited to standard epistemological problems of other minds, metaphysical substances, body/soul dualism and related issues of consciousness and cognition. This volume endeavors to take the question of hosting the stranger to the deeper level of embodied imagination and the senses (in the Greek sense of aisthesis). This volume plays host to a number of encounters with the strange. It asks such questions as: How does the embodied imagination relate to the Stranger in terms of hospitality or hostility (given the common root of hostis as both host and enemy)? How do we distinguish between projections of fear or fascination, leading to either violence or welcome? How do humans sensethe dimension of the strange and alien in different religions, arts, and cultures? How do the five physical senses relate to the spiritual senses, especially the famous sixthsense, as portals to an encounter with the Other? Is there a carnal perception of alterity, which would operate at an affective, prereflective, preconscious level? What exactly do embodied imaginariesof hospitality and hostility entail, and how do they operate in language, psychology, and social interrelations (including racism, xenophobia, and scapegoating)? And what, finally, are the topical implications of these questions for an ethics and practice of tolerance and peace?<br>

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: The doctrine of productive imagination that informs Kant’s theory of art would appear to complement his discourse on freedom, the cornerstone of the three
                  Critiques. It is far from obvious, however, whether Kant’s efforts to develop a model of practical human autonomy are in any sense “clarified” by his statement that poetry “sets the imagination free.” A great deal of scholarship on Romanticism has relied, implicitly or explicitly, on the assumption of a substantive connection between creativity and liberty—if not their outright identity—but this position is rarely evaluated by trying to use it as a vantage point from<br>

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HALLIBURTON DAVID<br>
  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Book Title: Italian Irish Filmmakers-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lourdeaux Lee<br>
  Abstract: "This penetrating study examines how these filmmakers confronted their cultural heritage and used it as a counterpoint to their depiction of mainstream America." --American Cinematographer In this unique film history, Lee Lourdeaux traces the impact of Irish and Italian cultures on four major American directors and their work. Defining the core values and tensions within each culture, and especially focusing on the influence of American Catholicism, he presents John Ford, Frank Capra, Francis Coppola, and Martin Scorsese as ethnic Americans and film artists. Lourdeaux shows each filmmaker on set with writers and actors, learning to bypass stereotypes in order to develop a shrewd reciprocal assimilation between his ethnic background and Anglo America. Beginning with D. W. Griffith's depiction of Irish and Italian immigrants, the author discusses Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of ethnic priests, cops, politicians, and gangsters, as well as their surface acculturation in the movies of the 1920s. By the decade's end, John Ford was using all-American stories to embody the basic myths and tensions of Irish-American life. In his later westerns and foreign films, he tried to understand both Irish political strife and the key figures of Irish liturgy. Frank Capra pitted Italian family values against the Anglo success ethic, turning out social comedies about oppressed little people. Several decades later, Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola were highly critical of their religio-ethnic heritage, though they gradually discovered that to outline its weaknesses, like the blind pursuit of success, was to fashion a critical mirror of mainstream America. Lourdeaux discusses a number of recent films by Coppola and by Scorsese that have not yet been analyzed in any book. And, in the chapter on Scorsese, a personal interview with the director reveals how his ethnic childhood shaped his work in film. Examining the conflicts within American culture, Lourdeaux shows how the filmmake~<br>

  Abstract: I have a confession to make: I used to be a Calvinist. For some, that label means absolutely nothing. For others, it provokes an intense response—Calvinism tends to have that effect. Where I went to college, at a small Baptist school in the South, whether you were a Calvinist really mattered, for it determined which of the fifteen campus Bible studies you could attend. By the prevenient grace of God, I was eventually lured beyond the imaginative cage of John Calvin, and I finally moved out of the Baptist enclave that rivaled Geneva for its lack of theological imagination.¹<br>

  Book Title: "Insubordinate Irish"-Travellers in the Text<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): hAodha Mícheál Ó<br>
  Abstract: This book traces a number of common themes relating to the representation of Irish Travellers in Irish popular tradition and how these themes have impacted on Ireland’s collective imagination. A particular focus of the book is on the exploration of the Traveller as “Other", an "Other" who is perceived as both inside and outside Ireland’s collective ideation. Frequently constructed as a group whose cultural tenets are in a dichotomous opposition to that of the “settled" community, this book demonstrates the ambivalence and complexity of the Irish Traveller “Other" in the context of a European postcolonial country. Not only has the construction and representation of Travellers always been less stable and “fixed" than previously supposed, these images have been acted upon and changed by both the Traveller and non-Traveller communities as the situation has demanded. Drawing primarily on little-explored Irish language sources, this volume demonstrates the fluidity of what is often assumed as reified or “fixed". As evidenced in Irish-language cultural sources the image of the Traveller is inextricably linked with the very concept of Irish identity itself. They are simultaneously the same and “Other" and frequently function as exemplars of the hegemony of native Irish culture as set against colonial traditions. This book is an important addition to the Irish Studies canon, in particular as relating to those exciting and unexplored terrains hitherto deemed “marginal" - Traveller Studies, Romani Studies and Diaspora/Migration Studies to name but a few.<br>

Through Werbner's skillful interpretations of the language of divination, a picture of Tswapong moral imagination is revealed. Concerns about dignity and personal illumination, witchcraft, pollution, the anger of dead ancestors, as well as the nature of life, truth, cosmic harmony, being, and becoming emerge in this charged African setting.<br>

It is at once visual, tactile, and verbal—to draw on an oral archive of archaic praise poetry and to make small things—the divinatory lots—speak with much moral significance about elusive and often ill-defined concerns. Many images are brought to bear with the poetry and the lots; the juxtapositions are sometimes paradoxical, not easily fused together. Yet there is a promise of getting wise guidance from an expert—the experienced diviner. What a diviner and his clients seek to grasp escapes ordinary knowledge—it concerns the occult in<br>

  Book Title: Timing Canada-The Shifting Politics of Time in Canadian Literary Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): Huebener Paul<br>
  Abstract: From punch clocks to prison sentences, from immigration waiting periods to controversial time-zone boundaries, from Indigenous grave markers that count time in centuries rather than years, to the fact that free time is shrinking faster for women than for men - time shapes the fabric of Canadian society every day, but in ways that are not always visible or logical. In Timing Canada, Paul Huebener draws from cultural history, time-use surveys, political statements, literature, and visual art to craft a detailed understanding of how time operates as a form of power in Canada. Time enables everything we do - as Margaret Atwood writes, "without it we can't live." However, time also disempowers us, divides us, and escapes our control. Huebener transforms our understanding of temporal power and possibility by using examples from Canadian and Indigenous authors - including Jeannette Armstrong, Joseph Boyden, Dionne Brand, Timothy Findley, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Gabrielle Roy, and many others - who witness, question, dismantle, and reconstruct the functioning of time in their works. As the first comprehensive study of the cultural politics of time in Canada, Timing Canada develops foundational principles of critical time studies and everyday temporal literacy, and demonstrates how time functions broadly as a tool of power, privilege, and imagination within a multicultural and multi-temporal nation.<br>

Sorcery fetishises human agency, often one which it magically enhances, as the key mediating factor affecting the course or direction of human life-chances. The fabulous character of so much sorcery practice, its transgressive and unbounded dimensions, a rich symbolism that appears to press towards and beyond the limits of the human imagination, is surely connected to the overpowering and totalising impetus that sorcery recognises in human agency and capacities.<br>

  Abstract: From rumors about gnostic orgies in antiquity to the explicit erotic symbolism of alchemical texts, from the subtly coded eroticism of medieval kabbalah to the sexual magic practiced by contemporary occultists and countercultural translations of Asian Tantra, the history of Western esotericism is rich in references to the domains of eros and sexuality. This volume, which brings together an impressive array of top-level specialists, is the first to analyze the eroticism of the esoteric without sensationalism or cheap generalizations, but on the basis of expert scholarship and attention to textual and historical detail. While there are few domains where the imagination may so easily run wild, the various contributions seek to distinguish fact from fiction-only to find that historical realities are sometimes even stranger than the fantasies. In doing so, they reveal the outlines of a largely unknown history spanning more than twenty centuries.<br>

  Book Title: Memory-Histories, Theories, Debates<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SCHWARZ BILL<br>
  Abstract: Memory has never been closer to us, yet never more difficult to understand. In the more than thirty specially commissioned essays that make up this book, leading scholars survey the histories, the theories, and the faultlines that compose the field of memory research.The volume reconstructs the work of the great philosophical and literary figures of the last two centuries who recast the concept of memory and brought it into the forefront of the modernist and postmodernist imagination-among them, Bergson, Halbwachs, Freud, Proust, Benjamin, Adorno, Derrida, and Deleuze. Drawing on recent advances in the sciences and in the humanities, the contributors address thequestion of how memory works, highlighting transactions between the interiority of subjective memory and the larger fields of public or collective memory.The public, political life of memory is an increasingly urgent issue in the societies we now inhabit, while the category of memory itself seems to become ever more capacious.Asking how we might think about the politics of memory, the closing chapters explore anumber of defining instances in which the troubled phenomenon of memory has entered and reshaped our very conception of what makes and drives the domain of politics. These include issues of slavery, the Soviet experience, the Holocaust, feminism and recovered memory, and memory in post-apartheid South Africa.<br>

  Book Title: Drinking from the Wells of New Creation-The Holy Spirit and the Imagination in Reconciliation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Dearborn Kerry<br>
  Abstract: The Holy Spirit, as God’s abiding presence to draw people to Christ, can cleanse wounds and bring love and hope into our hearts. Kerry Dearborn’s insightful focus on the Holy Spirit transforming our moral imagination and putting us on the path of reconciliation with Jesus Christ is both profound and encouraging. Biblical analysis, historical surveys and references to acclaimed theological authors support Dearborn’s nuanced yet practical application of imagination as a tool for awakening, recovery, and dissolving intellectual or psychological barriers that isolate us from God. She considers effectively how imagination can be connected to reality, and is able to delve deep into this vein of thought with startling clarity. Drinking from the Wells of New Creation provides spiritual guidance for dealing with oppression in society; an issue that affects people both within and outside the Christian faith. The acknowledgement of reconciliation as a creative process provides a fresh outlook and will excite those delving into both theological and psychological studies, as well as those seeking to understand God’s unification of life, regardless of tribe, tongue and nation.<br>

Because of the Spirit’s universal, life-giving, and particularized presence, these waters are available even in the most turbulent and seemingly desolate places. Furthermore, I have proposed that the channels in which these waters often flow most freely, at least initially, are those of the imagination. It is through the imagination that God’s Spirit carries creativity, hope, and love into our hearts when there may be rational and psychological objections<br>

In this sense, the Eucharist is not “rooted” in its history, but rather

I have also shown that such a dialogical approach is theologically funded by a pneumatological imagination as manifest particularly in the Acts narrative. Further, such a pneumatologically inspired dialogical method may be uniquely suited to enable navigation of our postfoundationalist, post-Christendom, postsecular, postmodern, and pluralistic landscape.<br>

  Publisher: University of Ottawa Press<br>
  Author(s): Rampton David<br>
  Abstract: More than fifty years after the publication of
      Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye remains one of Canada's most influential intellectuals. This reappraisal reasserts the relevance of his work to the study of literature and illuminates its fruitful intersection with a variety of other fields, including film, cultural studies, linguistics, and feminism. Many of the contributors draw upon the early essays, correspondence, and diaries recently published as part of theCollected Works of Northrop Fryeseries, in order to explore the development of his extraordinary intellectual range and the implications of his imaginative syntheses. They refute postmodernist arguments that Frye's literary criticism is obsolete and propose his wide-ranging and non-linear ways of thinking as a model for twenty-first century readers searching for innovative ways of understanding literature and its relevance to contiguous disciplines. The volume provides an in-depth examination of Frye's work on a range of literary questions, periods, and genres, as well as a consideration of his contributions to literary theory, philosophy, and theology. The portrait that emerges is that of a writer who still has much to offer those interested in literature and the ways it represents and transforms our world. The book's overall argument is that Frye's case for the centrality of the imagination has never been more important where understanding history, reconciling science and culture, or reconceptualizing social change is concerned.<br>

                  One Thousand and One Nights—also known asThe Arabian Nights—have exercised a particular fascination on the Western imagination. Whether it is in the context of the Orientalist construction of an exotic Eastern “Other” or the more recent feminist and postcolonial rereadings of the tales, theNightsis a text that has generated numerous critical responses as well as a wealth of literary, musical, artistic, and cinematographic adaptations, some of which are examined in this chapter.¹ In this respect, it constitutes an ideal text for college students to<br>

  Abstract: The imaginative geographies of twentieth-century New York, a time when the city was considered by many to be the capital of the world (perhaps the last), provide the impetus for discussion in this chapter. While imperialist Europe may have dominated the nineteenth-century’s imagination of civilization, in the wake of two world wars, the twentieth century witnessed the dislocation of a geopolitics dominated by European imperialist expansion, and the establishment of a new global political order increasingly dominated by the capitalist market economy and American foreign policy. This shift of power within the West was also fundamental for the establishment of<br>

  Abstract: Images in literary works are words that appeal to the senses to conjure up a corresponding picture in the mind of the reader. By definition, such images appeal to the reader’s imagination, which has the capacity both to visualize and to interpret. The Gospel of John uses a remarkable number of sensory images to tell its story and express its unique perspective on faith. Many of these images, through the course of the Johannine narrative, take on the character of religious symbols: vehicles of the divine world. Appealing to the imagination, image and symbol make it possible for the implied<br>

In manner, the chapter is historical, analytical, and abstract, in effect a further shift. These changes threaten to confirm the very chasm between science and the humanities against which I argue. Yet my first three chapters have treated matters that relevantly recur in this one, such as physical and intellectual vision, body and mind, imagination, knowledge, figurative illumination, and Neoplatonism.

  Book Title: Fueling Culture-101 Words for Energy and Environment<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Yaeger Patricia<br>
  Abstract: How has our relation to energy changed over time? What differences do particular energy sources make to human values, politics, and imagination? How have transitions from one energy source to another—from wood to coal, or from oil to solar to whatever comes next—transformed culture and society? What are the implications of uneven access to energy in the past, present, and future? Which concepts and theories clarify our relation to energy, and which just get in the way? Fueling Culture offers a compendium of keywords written by scholars and practitioners from around the world and across the humanities and social sciences. These keywords offer new ways of thinking about energy as both the source and the limit of how we inhabit culture, with the aim of opening up new ways of understanding the seemingly irresolvable contradictions of dependence upon unsustainable energy forms. Fueling Culture brings together writing that is risk-taking and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from literary and cultural studies, environmental history and ecocriticism, political economy and political ecology, postcolonial and globalization studies, and materialisms old and new. Keywords in this volume include: Aboriginal, Accumulation, Addiction, Affect, America, Animal, Anthropocene, Architecture, Arctic, Automobile, Boom, Canada, Catastrophe, Change, Charcoal, China, Coal, Community, Corporation, Crisis, Dams, Demand, Detritus, Disaster, Ecology, Electricity, Embodiment, Ethics, Evolution, Exhaust, Fallout, Fiction, Fracking, Future, Gender, Green, Grids, Guilt, Identity, Image, Infrastructure, Innervation, Kerosene, Lebenskraft, Limits, Media, Metabolism, Middle East, Nature, Necessity, Networks, Nigeria, Nuclear, Petroviolence, Photography, Pipelines, Plastics, Renewable, Resilience, Risk, Roads, Rubber, Rural, Russia, Servers, Shame, Solar, Spill, Spiritual, Statistics, Surveillance, Sustainability, Tallow, Texas, Textiles, Utopia, Venezuela, Whaling, Wood, Work For a full list of ~<br>

  Abstract: To write about Nigeria in relation to ENERGY and culture is to write about the Niger Delta, the very theater of energy production. Indeed, one cannot write about energy culture in the Nigerian context without engaging the spectacle of violence it elicits, both in the public mind and in the sphere of creative imagination, precisely because the form of sociality that oil energy generates in cultural production is imagined and inscribed in idioms of violence. My concern here with this concept of violence is less with the destructiveness it inflicts (which is considerable) than with the intricacy of its operation<br>

  Abstract: Joyce, it seems, prized memory above all human faculties, going so far as to declare to his friend Frank Budgen that “[i]magination is memory” (Budgen 1970, 187). While the comment suggests a neat equivalence of imagination and memory, Joyce’s apparent monism is belied by the considerably more nuanced treatment of this theme in his writings. While he may have championed Giambattista Vico’s belief that the artist’s imagination is essentially a reworking of memory, it does not follow that mastering one’s powers of recall is always sufficient in controlling one’s creative material.

And dances—along with hurtling locomotives, car chases, cattle stampedes, tennis matches, intergalactic dog-fights, and the like—move. Thus, a significant portion of the history of moving pictures involves dance movement. Many moving-picture makers have devoted admirable amounts of effort and imagination to portraying dance in or through media as diverse as film, video, and computer animation.

  Book Title: The Operation of Grace-Further Essays on Art, Faith, and Mystery<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Wolfe Gregory<br>
  Abstract: The Operation of Grace collects a decade’s worth of essays by Gregory Wolfe taken from the pages of Image, the literary journal he founded more than a quarter century ago. As he notes in the preface, his Image editorials, while they cover a wide range of topics, focus on the intersection of “art, faith, and mystery". Wolfe believes that art and religion, while hardly identical, offer illuminating analogies to one another—art deepening faith through the empathetic reach of the imagination and faith anchoring art in a vision beyond the artist’s ego. Several essays dwell on how aesthetic values like ambiguity, tragedy, and beauty enlarge our understanding of the spiritual life. There are also a series of reflections that extend Wolfe’s campaign to renew the neglected and often misunderstood tradition of Christian humanism. Finally, there are sections that contain more personal meditations arising from Wolfe’s involvement in nurturing and promoting the work of emerging writers and artists. The Operation of Grace demonstrates once again why novelist Ron Hansen has spoken of Wolfe as “one of the most incisive and persuasive voices of our generation".<br>

  Book Title: The Only Mind Worth Having-Thomas Merton and the Child Mind<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Williams Rowan<br>
  Abstract: In The Only Mind Worth Having, Fiona Gardner takes Thomas Merton’s belief that the child mind is “the only mind worth having" and explores it in the context of Jesus’ challenging, paradoxical, and enigmatic command to become like small children. She demonstrates how Merton’s belief and Jesus’ command can be understood as part of contemporary spirituality and spiritual practice. To follow Christ’s command requires a great leap of the imagination. Gardner examines what it might mean to make this leap when one is an adult without it becoming sentimental and mawkish, or regressive and pathological. Using both psychological and spiritual insights, and drawing on the experiences of Thomas Merton and others, Gardner suggests that in some mysterious and paradoxical way recovering a sense of childhood spirituality is the path towards spiritual maturity. The move from childhood spirituality to adulthood and on to a spiritual maturity through the child mind is a move from innocence to experience to organised innocence, or from dependence to independence to a state of being in-dependence with God.<br>

  Book Title: Dynastic Crisis and Cultural Innovation-From the Late Ming to the Late Qing and Beyond<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Wei Shang<br>
  Abstract: This volume addresses cultural and literary transformation in the late Ming (1550–1644) and late Qing (1851–1911) eras. Although conventionally associated with a devastating sociopolitical crisis, each of these periods was also a time when Chinese culture was rejuvenated. Focusing on the twin themes of crisis and innovation, the seventeen chapters in this book aim to illuminate the late Ming and late Qing as eras of literary-cultural innovation during periods of imperial disintegration; to analyze linkages between the two periods and the radical heritage they bequeathed to the modern imagination; and to rethink the “premodernity" of the late Ming and late Qing in the context of the end of the age of modernism. The chapters touch on a remarkably wide spectrum of works, some never before discussed in English, such as poetry, drama, full-length novels, short stories, tanci narratives, newspaper articles, miscellanies, sketches, familiar essays, and public and private historical accounts. More important, they intersect on issues ranging from testimony about dynastic decline to the negotiation of authorial subjectivity, from the introduction of cultural technology to the renewal of literary convention.<br>

Au seuil de la présentation d’ne anthologie de l’oeuvre de Ricoeur, Michaël Foessel souligne la difficulté de définir sa philosophie à partir d’un thème majeur tant sa profusion est grande.

  Abstract: We don’t grieve abstractly; we mourn particular losses of people, places, animals, objects, and ideas to whom and to which we are attached. These losses range from the most direct to those grasped only in the historical imagination. The death of a pet, the paving over of a favourite childhood playsite, the roadside body of the deer we just hit with our car, river gorges obliterated by dam-building projects, mountaintops removed by mining, once-familiar landscapes permanently transformed by nuclear contamination, night stars obscured by light pollution, and the absence of buffalo moving freely across the Great Plains are all grievable<br>

  Abstract: According to Lionel Trilling, authenticity ”usurp[ed] [sincerity’s] place in our esteem” somewhere between sincerity’s heyday (the sixteenth or seventeenth century) and today.¹ While sincerity ”had dominion over men’s imagination of how they ought to be” in the early modern period,² late modernity has become, in Charles Taylor’s words, ”The Age of Authenticity.”³ Although both are forms of self-congruence, sincerity and authenticity often stand at odds with each another. Most late modern thinkers prefer authenticity over sincerity for one of two overlapping reasons.

Despite recent demonstrations of cortical antecedents in phasic REM discharge, it could still be that imagistic bizarreness works on the randomization model of creativity, so favored in current artificial intelligence accounts. On that model, creative imagery would operate by destroying the continuity of ongoing propositional intelligence, so that its later reestablishment would have to include novel and so potentially useful elements.

Subjectivity turned to stone has also been linked (most notably in the wake of Benjamin’s reflections on Baudelaire) to another distinction—that between symbol and allegory in the aesthetics of poetic representation. In Baudelaire the petrified order of things signifies the death of the “symbol,” understood as the quasi-animistic, “living,” and embodying force of analogy and

  Author(s): Sanders Steven M.<br>
  Abstract: The science fiction genre maintains a remarkable hold on the imagination and enthusiasm of the filmgoing public, captivating large audiences worldwide and garnering ever-larger profits. Science fiction films entertain the possibility of time travel and extraterrestrial visitation and imaginatively transport us to worlds transformed by modern science and technology. They also provide a medium through which questions about personal identity, moral agency, artificial consciousness, and other categories of experience can be addressed. In The Philosophy of Science Fiction Film, distinguished authors explore the storylines, conflicts, and themes of fifteen science fiction film classics, from Metropolis to The Matrix. Editor Steven M. Sanders and a group of outstanding scholars in philosophy, film studies, and other fields raise science fiction film criticism to a new level by penetrating the surface of the films to expose the underlying philosophical arguments, ethical perspectives, and metaphysical views. Sanders's introduction presents an overview and evaluation of each essay and poses questions for readers to consider as they think about the films under discussion.The first section, "Enigmas of Identity and Agency," deals with the nature of humanity as it is portrayed in Blade Runner, Dark City, Frankenstein, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Total Recall. In the second section, "Extraterrestrial Visitation, Time Travel, and Artificial Intelligence," contributors discuss 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys, and The Day the Earth Stood Still and analyze the challenges of artificial intelligence, the paradoxes of time travel, and the ethics of war. The final section, "Brave Newer World: Science Fiction Futurism," looks at visions of the future in Metropolis, The Matrix, Alphaville, and screen adaptations of George Orwell's 1984.<br>

  Book Title: Overcoming Our Evil-Human Nature and Spiritual Exercises in Xunzi and Augustine<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stalnaker Aaron<br>
  Abstract: Can people ever really change? Do they ever become more ethical, and if so, how?
      Overcoming Our Evilfocuses on the way ethical and religious commitments are conceived and nurtured through the methodical practices that Pierre Hadot has called "spiritual exercises." These practices engage thought, imagination, and sensibility, and have a significant ethical component, yet aim for a broader transformation of the whole personality. Going beyond recent philosophical and historical work that has focused on ancient Greco-Roman philosophy, Stalnaker broadens ethical inquiry into spiritual exercises by examining East Asian as well as classical Christian sources, and taking religious and seemingly "aesthetic" practices such as prayer, ritual, and music more seriously as objects of study. More specifically,Overcoming Our Evilexamines and compares the thought and practice of the early Christian Augustine of Hippo, and the early Confucian Xunzi. Both have sophisticated and insightful accounts of spiritual exercises, and both make such ethical work central to their religious thought and practice. Yet to understand the two thinkers' recommendations for cultivating virtue we must first understand some important differences. Here Stalnaker disentangles the competing aspects of Augustine and Xunxi's ideas of "human nature." His groundbreaking comparison of their ethical vocabularies also drives a substantive analysis of fundamental issues in moral psychology, especially regarding emotion and the complex idea of "the will," to examine how our dispositions to feel, think, and act might be slowly transformed over time. The comparison meticulously constructs vivid portraits of both thinkers demonstrating where they connect and where they diverge, making the case that both have been misunderstood and misinterpreted. In throwing light on these seemingly disparate ancient figures in unexpected ways, Stalnaker redirects recent debate regarding practices of personal formation, and more ~<br>

  Abstract: In sharp reversal of the monolithic imagination of national identity projected for so long by the culturally levelling discourses of Francoism, Spanishness, for the past two decades, has been actively constructed in terms of multiplicity and synchronicity. Any location of identity thus rests on the historically contingent axes of temporal and spatial parts. In this scattered and fragmented cultural landscape, the modern imagination of nation necessarily cedes to a more ambivalent vision of collective identity, one that allows for a more adept navigation through the disjuncture of postmodernity. Ironically, therefore, this has meant the return to the concept of community.<br>

  Abstract: Islam occupies a unique position in the medieval Jewish imagination. From the tenth through the thirteenth centuries, Islamic society was for many Jews the bastion of civilization and culture, in which Jews played a vital and transformative role.¹ Yet as members of a proud religious minority, many Jews regarded the religion of Islam with deep ambivalence. Jews at once repudiated Islam as a legitimate faith while singling it out from all others as an exponent of pure monotheism on par with its Jewish precursor. As such, Islam occupied a middle position in Jewish law, outside the divine covenant yet the<br>

She pointedly surveys the numerous literary taboos and prejudices that have served as creative straightjackets for Caribbean writers, restricting them to themes and idioms that, in her view, deaden the imagination and stifle the ability to dream.

  Abstract: If a state cannot enact traditional retribution for its citizens who were victimized by the former government, is there any point in the gathering and publishing of these victims’ stories? While the story of the evolution from revenge to retribution shows us that a state must do something, must take responsibility to effect a rebalancing for the victims or risk a reversion to personal revenge, our collective imagination has given us little in the way of alternatives to state violence. The pendulum of possible responses swings without pausing from the extreme of traditional retributive justice—requiring investigations, trials, and punishment<br>

  Book Title: Beyond the Red Notebook-Essays on Paul Auster<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Barone Dennis<br>
  Abstract: The novels of Paul Auster-finely wrought, self-reflexive, filled with doublings, coincidences, and mysteries-have captured the imagination of readers and the admiration of many critics of contemporary literature. In
      Beyond the Red Notebook, the first book devoted to the works of Auster, Dennis Barone has assembled an international group of scholars who present twelve essays that provide a rich and insightful examination of Auster's writings. The authors explore connections between Auster's poetry and fiction, the philosophical underpinnings of his writing, its relation to detective fiction, and its unique embodiment of the postmodern sublime. Their essays provide the fullest analysis available of Auster's themes of solitude, chance, and paternity found in works such asThe Invention of Solitude,City of Glass,Ghosts,The Locked Room,In the Country of Last Things,Moon Palace,The Music of Chance, andLeviathan. This volume includes contributions from Pascal Bruckner, Marc Chenetier, Norman Finkelstein, Derek Rubin, Madeleine Sorapure, Stephen Bernstein, Tim Woods, Steven Weisenburger, Arthur Saltzman, Eric Wirth, and Motoyuki Shibata. The extensive bibliography, prepared by William Drenttel, will greatly benefit both scholars and general readers.<br>

The notion of the “bioregional imagination” as explored throughout this book is created by place-conscious literature, art, natural-history writing, and thoughtful daily living. It is an effort to cultivate the sort of community Sale and others imagine, one that, many believe, might enable us to dwell more sustainably in place. What I investigate here, however,<br>

  Book Title: Ciaran Carson-Space, Place, Writing<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): ALEXANDER NEAL<br>
  Abstract: Ciaran Carson is one of the most challenging and inventive of contemporary Irish writers, exhibiting verbal brilliance, formal complexity, and intellectual daring across a remarkably varied body of work. This study considers the full range of his oeuvre, in poetry, prose, and translations, and discusses the major themes to which he returns, including: memory and history, narrative, language and translation, mapping, violence, and power. It argues that the singularity of Carson’s writing is to be found in his radical imaginative engagements with ideas of space and place. The city of Belfast, in particular, occupies a crucially important place in his texts, serving as an imaginative focal point around which his many other concerns are constellated. The city, in all its volatile mutability, is an abiding frame of reference and a reservoir of creative impetus for Carson’s imagination. Accordingly, the book adopts an interdisciplinary approach that draws upon geography, urbanism, and cultural theory as well as literary criticism. It provides both a stimulating and thorough introduction to Carson’s work, and a flexible critical framework for exploring literary representations of space.<br>

This impression is reinforced by a number of additional elements. First, there is the somewhat jarring insistence on the “virility” of the poet-youth,<br>

  Book Title: Performing Africa-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>

  Abstract: Africa often enters the global imagination through news accounts of ethnic war, famine, and despotic political regimes. Those interested in countering such dystopic images--be they cultural nationalists in the African diaspora or connoisseurs of "global culture"--often found their representations of an emancipatory Africa on an enthusiasm for West African popular culture and performance arts. Based on extensive field research in The Gambia and focusing on the figure of the jali, Performing Africa interrogates these representations together with their cultural and political implications. It explores how Africa is produced, circulated, and consumed through performance and how encounters through performance create the place of Africa in the world. Innovative and discerning, Performing Africa is a provocative contribution to debates over cultural nationalism and the construction of identity and history in Africa and elsewhere.<br>

  Book Title: Contesting Spirit-Nietzsche, Affirmation, Religion<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): ROBERTS TYLER T.<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche criticizes the ascetic hatred of the body and this-worldly life, yet engages in rigorous practices of self-denial--he sees philosophy as such a practice--and affirms the need of imposing suffering on oneself in order to enhance the spirit. He dismisses the "intoxication" of mysticism, yet links mysticism, power, and creativity, and describes his own self-transcending experiences. The tensions in his relation to religion are closely related to that between negation and affirmation in his thinking in general. In Roberts's view, Nietzsche's transfigurations of religion offer resources for a postmodern religious imagination. Though as a "master of suspicion," Nietzsche, with Freud and Marx, is an integral part of modern antireligion, he has the power to take us beyond the flat, modern distinction between the secular and the religious--a distinction that, at the end of modernity, begs to be reexamined.<br>

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

Clowes examines the technical innovations meta-utopian writers have made in style, image, and narrative structure that inform fresh modes of social imagination. Her analysis leads to an inquiry into the intended and real audiences of this fiction, and into the ways its authors try to move them toward more sophisticated social discourse.<br>

  Abstract: Where does meta-utopian narrative stand in the general crisis of social imagination and the parallel crisis of representational aesthetics? Born in isolation, Russian meta-utopian fiction is certainly not an isolated phenomenon. It parallels the renewed attention to language, semiotic play, and narrative structure that has figured so importantly in the West in opening up new insight into ideological structures. Its challenge to maximalist, bipolar thinking and its argument for the middle ground makes meta-utopian fiction very much of a piece with current social, literary, and philosophical discourse.

  Abstract: The deconstructive view that language, because of its figural deviousness, never coincides with meaning is not unprecedented.

  Book Title: History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Morrison Karl F.<br>
  Abstract: Karl Morrison discusses historical writing at a turning point in European culture: the so-called Renaissance of the twelfth century. Why do texts considered at that time to be masterpieces seem now to be fragmentary and full of contradictions? Morrison maintains that the answer comes from ideas about art. Viewing histories as artifacts made according to the same aesthetic principles as paintings and theater, he shows that twelfth-century authors and audiences found unity not in what the reason read in a text but in what the imagination read into it: they prized visual over verbal imagination and employed a circular, or nuclear, spectator-centered perspective cast aside in the Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<br>

  A WORD ON “MEDIEVAL HUMANISM” from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdgf">History as a Visual Art in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance</a><br>
  Abstract: Thus far, we have identified a few guidelines that governed historical writing as an art of the imagination. Like any compositions, the works with which we are concerned depended on exclusion as well as inclusion, but even what was included has appeared shapeless to modern scholars. There is little regard for narrative unity, no organic wholeness. At some times, one encounters gaps in a narrative; at others, a concatenation of narratives. To lay hands on the thinking behind the montage effect of these texts, we must turn from the words to the silences between the words, understanding, to be sure,<br>

  Book Title: The Life of Roman Republicanism-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): CONNOLLY JOY<br>
  Abstract: With an original combination of close reading and political theory, Joy Connolly argues that Cicero, Sallust, and Horace inspire fresh thinking about central concerns of contemporary political thought and action. These include the role of conflict in the political community, especially as it emerges from class differences; the necessity of recognition for an equal and just society; the corporeal and passionate aspects of civic experience; citizens' interdependence on one another for senses of selfhood; and the uses and dangers of self-sovereignty and fantasy. Putting classicists and political theorists in dialogue, the book also addresses a range of modern thinkers, including Kant, Hannah Arendt, Stanley Cavell, and Philip Pettit. Together, Connolly's readings construct a new civic ethos of advocacy, self-criticism, embodied awareness, imagination, and irony.<br>

  Abstract: Are the resources of premodern thought adequate to modernity? George Kateb argues that to understand the scale of modern horrors we must come to grips with the human imagination—specifically, the tremendous new capacity of the imagination of one or a few people to unleash itself on the world. Leaders construct society or law afresh in their minds with an energy that Kateb calls “hyperactive”; they go on to sway their followers to make the stuff of their imaginations real. In cases when change leads to atrocity, imagination is once again responsible—this time, the stunted imaginations of the followers,<br>

Despite the bleakness of Hardy’s outlook—his view of life as an inherently unsanctioned process, an empty sequence of happenstances—he retained an enabling attachment (however complicated) to his native Dorset countryside. He absorbed its legends, its history, its customs, its landscape; and these absorptions may account for the modulated tone of even his darkest utterances. He is not surprised, his tone keeps repeating, because what is human history if not the immemorial story of expectation drained dry by time’s passage?<br>

  Abstract: What is it to be human? What are our specifically human attributes, our capacities and liabilities?Such questions gave birth to anthropology as an Enlightenment science. This book argues that it is again appropriate to bring "the human" to the fore, to reclaim the singularity of the word as central to the anthropological endeavor, not on the basis of thesubstanceof a human nature - "To be human is to act like this and react like this, to feel this and want this" - but in terms of species-widecapacities: capabilities for action and imagination, liabilities for suffering and cruelty. The contributors approach "the human" with an awareness of these complexities and particularities, rendering this volume unique in its ability to build on anthropology's ethnographic expertise.<br>

One can imagine bodily otherness that exceeds the limits both of one’s current physique and of current sociocultural definition.

  Abstract: In A Politics of the Ordinary, Thomas Dumm dramatizes how everyday life in the United States intersects with and is influenced by the power of events, on the one hand, and forces of conformity and normalcy on the other. Combining poststructuralist analysis with a sympathetic reading of a strain of American thought that begins with Emerson and culminates in the work of Stanley Cavell, A Politics of the Ordinary investigates incidents from everyday life, political spectacles, and popular culture. Whether juxtaposing reflections about boredom in rural New Mexico with Emerson's theory of constitutional amendment, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation with Thoreau's writings to overcome quiet desperation, or demonstrating how Disney's Toy Story allegorizes the downsizing of the American white-collar work force, Dumm's constant concern is to show how the ordinary is the primary source of the democratic political imagination.<br>

The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law.

Anglicanism historically also values proclamation, with Scripture and sermon integral to its liturgy; as Tracy points out, the Christian faith has historically held that “Jesus Christ is both the decisive word and the<br>

  Abstract: THE NOTION OF “CROSSROADS,” which in Spanish also has the figurative meaning of “dilemma” is associated with another closely related word, “labyrinth,” which in present times implies a pathway through a literary universe where Kafka, Borges, Hawthorne and Octavio Paz, author of

I believe that as writers and poets become aware of their vocation, they discover a different world—of words, of the imagination—and that this discovery makes them appear strange to other people. They are perceived as having failed to adjust to a reality that is too harsh or alien<br>

  Abstract: Monsters, madmen, and ghouls have always stalked the American imagination.

The elevation of the imagination by the Sicilian school had its highest manifestation in Giacomo da Lentini, for whom the image of the beloved, painted in the lover’s heart, corresponded to the Aristotelian notion of the phantasm, the

  Abstract: In the first decade of the twenty-first century, religion once more became a prominent topic of public discourse and the language of religion, and of atheism, became the lingua franca in which key issues of the day were formulated. Whatever might be thought of the general level on which it has been taken up in our contemporary debates, this resurgence of religion facilitates the leap of historical imagination required to take us back to the intellectual climate of the nineteenth century, especially its first half.

Not defined simply as a co-ordinate on a map, home encompasses neighbourhoods, nations, traditions, customs, narrative, myth, the tangible, the imaginable, the dream, as well as each individual’s relation to Being. Home has relevance to all humans: despite its multifarious manifestations, our diverse relationships with home – whether positive, negative, or ambivalent – can be life-long and pervasive, creating and rekindling memories, inspiring desires and the imagination, shaping who we are, and how we relate to the Other.

We will suggest that the world, the experiences of which constitute our subjectivity, is an imaginary world and that the embodiment which constitutes our mode of being in that world is an imaginary embodiment.

We were, however, forced to accept that we were often dealing with three different kinds of worldview. The Czech language itself, as a network of concepts, conceptual links and linguistic habits, had been remodelled by the forces of the Marxist–Leninist worldview. This was by no means a one-way process: on the contrary, the concepts of ‘people’, ‘folk’ and ‘nation’ which were fundamental to the communist worldview were modelled using the plastic material of the Czech imagination, an<br>

Bunting’s representations of place are also complex and multi-layered, issuing from a geographical imagination that thrives on contradictions. His regional modernism is characterised both by the imaginative centrality of northern landscapes and cultural paradigms to his writing, and by the refraction of such local and regional attachments through a self-consciously international modernist poetics.Briggflattsexplores its themes of dislocation and homecoming through an intense imaginative engagement with the landscapes,<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning, cinema has been held up as a unique medium partly by virtue of the kind of attention it seems to demand. Appreciating a film involves a special combination of perception, cognition, imagination, and emotion. Cinema engages us across a wider range of our embodied mental capacities than any other medium of representation, extending from low-level reflexes to abstract reflection. Cinema engages not only our visual and auditory senses, in a direct fashion, but also our senses of touch and balance and, perhaps, even those of taste and smell, in an indirect fashion.

  Author(s) CHROSTOWSKA S. D.<br>
  Abstract: It seems to me that the main problem facing us at the turn of the century consists of taking leave of utopia while setting free the powers of the imagination. This thesis is not original, I freely admit, but it could be that it would allow us to get beyond the sterile oppositions between an ethics of conviction and an ethics, or politics, of responsibility. My reason for this will be developed on three, tightly connected registers. First of all, utopia—be it individualist or collectivist—traps us and the imagination within the alternative of realism and unreality, whereas realism<br>

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Abstract: In the last chapter, I discussed writing as a means of reenacting speech events such as dialogues and monologues, either for others or for oneself. If for oneself, this performance could be a silent simulation of speech using the reader’s articulatory and auditory imagination. In this concluding chapter I will sketch out some of the unique ways in which writing also began to represent aspects of the mind that only writing could reveal. We have no reason to assume that the new model of the mind that literate culture introduced was the inevitable outcome of evolutionary forces. For Europe, it<br>

  Abstract: Stories perform many functions for those who read them and those who write them. In this sense, we should first focus on what makes a story an important model for reflective judgment. I will argue that processes of aesthetic apprehension are created by the work of the productive imagination of some moral experiences. This makes stories important vehicles of reflective judgments. Through their written expression, moral stories have demonstrated that, in spite of many theorists’ skepticism, they capture the “ineffable” characteristics of evil actions.¹ In works of fiction as well as in historical stories about evil acts, the “ineffable” seems<br>

  Book Title: The Fate of Earthly Things-Aztec Gods and God-Bodies<br>
  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Molly H.<br>
  Abstract: Following their first contact in 1519, accounts of Aztecs identifying Spaniards as gods proliferated. But what exactly did the Aztecs mean by a "god" (teotl), and how could human beings become gods or take on godlike properties? This sophisticated, interdisciplinary study analyzes three concepts that are foundational to Aztec religion—teotl (god), teixiptla (localized embodiment of a god), and tlaquimilolli (sacred bundles containing precious objects)—to shed new light on the Aztec understanding of how spiritual beings take on form and agency in the material world. In The Fate of Earthly Things, Molly Bassett draws on ethnographic fieldwork, linguistic analyses, visual culture, and ritual studies to explore what ritual practices such as human sacrifice and the manufacture of deity embodiments (including humans who became gods), material effigies, and sacred bundles meant to the Aztecs. She analyzes the Aztec belief that wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim during a sacred rite could transform a priest into an embodiment of a god or goddess, as well as how figurines and sacred bundles could become localized embodiments of gods. Without arguing for unbroken continuity between the Aztecs and modern speakers of Nahuatl, Bassett also describes contemporary rituals in which indigenous Mexicans who preserve costumbres (traditions) incorporate totiotzin (gods) made from paper into their daily lives. This research allows us to understand a religious imagination that found life in death and believed that deity embodiments became animate through the ritual binding of blood, skin, and bone.<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Book Title: Spanish American Poetry after 1950-Beyond the Vanguard<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): SHAW DONALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Providing a basis for understanding the main lines of development of poetry in Spanish America after Vanguardism, this volume begins with an overview of the situation at the mid-century: the later work of Neruda and Borges, the emergence of Paz. Consideration is then given to the decisive impact of Parra and the rise of colloquial poetry, politico-social poetry (Dalton, Cardenal) and representative figures such as Orozco, Pacheco and Cisneros. The aim is to establish a few paths through the largely unmapped jungle of Spanish American poetry in the time period. The author emphasises the persistence of a generally negative view of the human condition and the poets' exploration of different ways of responding to it. These vary from outright scepticism to the ideological, the religious or those derived from some degree of confidence in the creative imagination as cognitive. At the same time there is analysis of the evolving outlook on poetry of the writers in question, both in regard to its possible social role and in regard to diction. DONALD SHAW holds the Brown Forman Chair of Spanish American literature in the University of Virginia.<br>

  Abstract: Unlike any other medium, literature has the ability to employ the reader’s imagination in the construction of bodies. When a narrator communicates information about a text’s characters, the reader completes the act of constructing bodies by imagining their contours, postures, and gestures. A character’s gender is thus dependent upon both the narrator’s speech—his/her use of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives—and the reader’s expectations regarding gender. If the narrator omits information about the character’s gender, the reader finds clues in the text—social cues, behaviors, and actions—to fill in that information and assign one. Such moments activate literature’s potential<br>

                     Land Sliding), a construction of spatial relations and imagination, a form of control over space in the context of colonialism. But maps are also deployed as a strategy to counter hegemonic models of space. This is a central aspect for postcolonial societies, in which colonial inscriptions, for instance through cartography, are challenged and deconstructed in literary texts.<br>

Abstract: “On ne se détache pas du merveilleux, quand une fois on lui a donné sa créance, et pendant longtemps on s’acharne à rationaliser la merveille plutôt qu’à la réduire.”
         122Gaston Bachelard’s astute observation on the difficulty of dissolving wonder may sum up the history of attempts at naturalizing the resurrection. Yet the raising of the dead is a special case. It may be, if it ever happens, the wonder of wonders, but it also stands apart from the natural and preternatural marvels the Enlightenment sought to discredit and domesticate.123The criteria of testimony used to judge miracles or extraordinary phenomena can apply only indirectly to an event supposed to be outside time and space and one supposed to signal the end of nature and the universe. Although the intrinsic plausibility of resurrection could be questioned, belief in its probability or certainty did not count as the superstitious or “enthusiastic” product of a diseased imagination. The Enlightenment contributed to make the miraculous less prominent in theology and faith and to leave it behind as a silent and unsettled question on the edges of culture, ignored, like marvels, rather than debunked. In the process, the body was lost.<br>

Abstract: 3. Did I overlook possible points of continuity across paradigms?The answer to this question relates to criteria for establishing continuity. The use of the same term, for example, does not mean that its meaning (extensionally or intensionally) is the same. Thus, Darnells suggestion that we all share ethnography, for example, is appealing, but I am not sure that ethnography means the same for all of those engaged in it, especially as more and more students are encouraged to work in their own communities and engage in urban (or suburban) fieldwork that often forces them to live the contradictions of an alienated native self or of a privileged fieldworker on the way to acquiring a professional multiplepersonality disorder. CookGumperz and Gumperz mention narrative and narrativity. It is difficult for me to see the narratives recorded by Boas as the same thing as the narratives collected and analyzed by Ochs and Capps (2001). They are both texts, but they were produced, recorded, and analyzed in such different ways that their similarities rapidly vanish as we expand the notion of teller to include the work done by participants in the narrative event. Finally, Spitulnik brings up the socalled SapirWhorf hypothesis as a possible source of continuity across paradigms. This is the most challenging of the three proposals for a thematic link across paradigms because the SapirWhorf hypothesis has almost mythical proportions in the public imagination. Together with the evolution of language (a topic that most linguists tend to avoid), the SapirWhorf hypothesis is a must in anthropology textbooks and in introductory books on language and culture. But the semanticindeterminacy problem is here even more serious than for ethnography and narrative given that, as Spitulnik knows (see her use of the qualifier socalled), there never was a SapirWhorf hypothesis, unless we take for it Hoijers (1954:93) rarely quoted informal and very general definition: The central idea of the SapirWhor~<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: This is where theories of feminist agency typically run into trouble, and Meyers’s view, despite its grounding in experience, is no exception. She argues that “what is important for women’s self‐determination is that, whether they choose to become mothers or not, they find discursive means to symbolize their particular relations to motherhood and through these self‐figurations resist their homogenization in matrigynist ideology” (54). Women are to consider “what it would be like to inhabit a proposed figuration by constructing scenarios in which the figuration guides their conduct and by viscerally imagining themselves acting out those scenarios” (55). She makes similar claims about the other cultural images she explores, and she always insists that such “discursive innovation is not by itself enough” (55). The problem arises not over the apparent similarity between these acts of imagination and the gender performativity Meyers rejects but over what else is needed.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Abstract: One can find such a coalescence of subaltern religious representations and creation of a politically solidary narrative via intentional hybridization in the works of the Korean
            minjungpoet Kim Chi Ha (1941– ). Kim’s poetry weaves Catholic liberation theology with the antifeudal and anticolonial social vision of the Tonghak religion, which rose as an indigenous religious movement of peasants for democratic revolution in Korea at the turn of the nineteenth century and played a prominent role in the 3.1 Independence Movement of 1919. The Tonghak religion itself was the product of a coalescence of elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and indigenous beliefs in the subaltern religious and social imagination of the Korean peasantry. In the unfinished talk poem (ballad)The World of Chang Il Tam, one of the works for which he was imprisoned, tortured, and sentenced to life imprisonment by the dictatorial South Korean regime of Park Chung Hee in 1976, Kim merges the symbols of the Eucharist—the mystical body of the deity that is eaten—with the Tonghak teaching of “human being is heaven [in nae chʾǒn]”: “Food is heaven / As we eat / God enters us / Food is heaven. / Oh, food / Should be shared and eaten by all.” See Kim Chi Ha,The Gold‐Crowned Jesus and Other Writings, ed. Chong Sun Kim and Shelly Killen (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1978), 13–39. See also hisSaengmyǒng(Seoul: Sol, 1992), 132–49. Kim’s religiously hybrid poetic vision has been one of the mainsprings of inspiration for South Korea’sminjungtheology.

Compare Pierre Grégoire,Syntaxeon artis mirabilis(Coloniae: Zetnzeri, 1610), bk. 36, chap. 7 (“De magnete”), 444–45; Paracelsus,Archidoxorum, seu de secretis naturae mysteriis(Basle: Petrum Pernam, 1582), bk. 6 (“Extractio magisterii ex sanguine”), 105–7. Tesauro concludes this list of authorities with Ioannes Lange (“il Langio”), whose medical theories on blood’s secret qualities are for Tesauro the most accurate. According to Tesauro, Lange stresses the antipathy arising from the imagination. Tesauro probably refers to a passage from Lange’sEpistolarum Medicinalium(Hanau: Claudium Marnium, 1605), bk. 1, epistle 24 (“De erotico amore effectu”), 103–4. Lange reports the story of Faustina, daughter of the emperor Antoninus Pius, who had fallen in love with a gladiator. To recover from this disease, some physicians suggested that she swallow some of the man’s warm blood. The gladiator was killed to fulfill this request.<br>

Abstract: How does one conduct such discussions and evaluations of selected differences in perspective coordination? I believe that the figure of an imaginary judge offers a solution, thus applying to interreligious dialogue an insight developed by Ricoeur in the field of historical research.
            52In a nutshell: to avoid partiality in such dialogue one requires an imaginary judge, who functions in the dialogue partners’ minds as a kind of regulatory principle of impartiality. He guides—in the partners’ imagination—the discussion and evaluation of the aforementioned selected differences.<br>

Abstract: This explains why the ceremony in July 1990, when the body was removed and then buried, attracted a staggering number of people who gathered to pay their last homage to a prominent historical figure. Dimitrov the figure and Dimitrov the mummy had been totally decoupled in the imagination of these people. (That is clearly not the case with the mummy and mausoleum of Lenin; its symbolic value is still very high, and any talk of its removal is perceived by a majority of Communists as a direct onslaught on the personality of Lenin and the overall ideology, as well as a nihilist attack on a whole historical period.)
         59This, I think, also explains why the square in front of Dimitrov's mausoleum did not become the exclusive space for communist demonstrations, while the square in front of the Alexander Nevski Cathedral did become the symbolic opposition site in the early days of democracy. The September 9 (later Alexander Battenberg) Square between the palace and the mausoleum was a shared political space, the playground of different political and nonpolitical performances. A couple of other places in Sofia did become preferred locations that were reserved for socialist demonstrations, however: one is the area around the monument marking the common grave (bratskata mogila) in the former Liberty Park (now the Boris Garden), and the other is a sort of self‐fashioned communist Hyde Park corner in the South Park, unmarked by a special monument but nonetheless drawing a steady crowd, especially on weekends.<br>

Abstract: In the case of children in particular, this responsibility is deeply circular. What is required is both the social self‐creativity of the adults around them and the gradual development of social self‐creative capabilities within children themselves. These have their beginnings in children’s play and imagination, but they also need to be nurtured into competencies for engaging with and changing society. All of us to one degree or another desire not only to participate in society for ourselves but also to have society respond in turn to our own incapabilities, vulnerabilities, and dependencies. Moral responsibility involves, in this case, not just reciprocity and equality but also a moment of ethical distanciation that opens the worlds of those responsible to surprising and disruptive transformation. From a childist point of view, moral responsibility is neither equally reciprocal nor authoritarian but asymmetrical or decentering. It involves what may be called a “distension” (to use Augustine’s word) of existing social assumptions, a creative “stretching out” (
         distensio) of comfortable moral horizons in response to what they marginalize, as well as a continuing effort to draw others and oneself into deeper social participation.52<br>

Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: How, then, are we to get out of the impasse and return a sense of vision to re‐vision? If rewriting is indeed change (see Moraru
         2001, 144), is change a positive value in itself? In his discussion of what he terms “radical typology,” Laurence Coupe emphasizes what he sees as myth’s “permanent possibility,” its “dynamic tension between the already and the not yet” (Coupe1997, 106). As Coupe argues, “all myths presuppose a previous narrative, and in turn form the model for future narratives” (108). In consequence, it is not toward demythologization (which is, after all, oriented toward the past and works, as Coupe points out, “in terms of closure” [108]) but toward remythologization that rewriting as re‐vision ought to aspire: to work toward disclosure, opening narratives to ever new re‐visions, and thus to “evade the stasis of doctrine” (110). “Permanent possibility,” “narrative dynamism”—Coupe’s terms echo distinctly with Bauman’s liquidity and should therefore be regarded with similar suspicion. More crucially, Coupe’s understanding of myth (derived from Paul Ricoeur) relies on a sense of utopia that is external to the rewriting it informs. As he explains, myth “is synonymous with a ‘social imagination’ which functions by virtue of a dialectic between ‘ideology’ and ‘utopia.’ … Without [ideology], we would have no sense of society or tradition; without [utopia], we would simply equate the given society and tradition with eternal truth” (1997, 96). The question remains: in the absence of utopia, what role for re‐vision?<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: As the chapter “Gone” executes the wrap-up and wind-down, the autumnal Clennam sits “listening to the voice as it read to him” and “heard in it” much of comfort—Amy's voice, of course, the only voice let through to him now. We notice that he is not said to have heard
         herexactly, let alone her words, but instead to have sensed in the aura of that voiced wording, heardinrather than from it, “all that great Nature was doing, heard in it all the soothing songs she sings to man,” harmony sealed tight by the inverted cognate object of “songs … sings.” But no rhetorical singsong can keep a certain psychic dissonance at bay, one that can be more closely registered by narratography. It may at first suggest Little Dorrit when Dickens writes, “At no Mother's knee but hers.” Yet she's a fiancée, remember, not a mother; he is referring instead to nature: “At no Mother's knee but hers, had he ever dwelt … on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early-fostered seeds of the imagination” (LD,p. 776). This is Wordsworth by the numbers, recallingThe Prelude's “Fair seed-time … Fostered alike by beauty and by fear,”18including that secondary intertextual slide, given the Clennam family context, toward the “Foster-child” and, yes, “Inmate Man” of theIntimations Odeand its mortal “prison-house.”19<br>

Abstract: In his notion of involuntary memory, Marcel corrects the Aristotelian principle that an object of the imagination that is imprinted in memory cannot coincide with the present experience of the object itself, because “there is no such thing as memory of the present.” Although he espouses the Aristotelian principle that “one can only imagine what is absent,” Marcel sees this principle as invalidated whenever the essential character of a presently experienced sensation coincides with that of a sensation imprinted in memory. In such an instance, one can enjoy the impression of the present sensation to the fullest; thanks to the intensifying “application” of one’s imagination of it, one enjoys, in other words, the impression that a sensation or event from the past is being concretely resuscitated in the here and now. This imaginative appreciation of the present throws one into the bliss of a dimension “emancipated from the order of time” (affranchie de l’ordre du temps) and makes one oblivious of or indifferent to the squalor of one’s “directly felt reality.” Aristotle, “On Memory,” in

Abstract: This account also indicates that the emotions are learned. As culturally mediated, they are transmitted by those who powerfully articulate a society’s standards of value. We gain a sense of how to interpret, respond to, and remember life’s contingencies with the aid of culture’s norms. Because our emotions are shaped by ethos and culture, it behooves us to consider how cultural images and political rhetoric bear upon the imagination. That is to say, given the dynamic relationship between character and culture, moral assessment of the former cannot overlook the quality of the latter. It is therefore necessary to evaluate how cultures ask their members to imagine themselves and their opponents when they consider recourse to war. For these (broad) Augustinian reasons, we can posit an ethics of heterology: cultural representations of the Other should be subject to moral evaluation insofar as they condition, and perhaps corrupt, one’s affective sense of what others are due.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: From this perspective, humanizing religion could mean an inquiry into the penchant of the human imagination to make deities in human, all too human, form and yet to mistake the creative power behind those ideas. The ancient satirists rightly noted that if animals had gods, they would look like them. Deities usually look like their worshippers. Humanizing religion, accordingly, would engage religious symbols, myths, and practices—even in their most blatant anthropomorphic forms—as indirect expressions of the human quest for meaning and thus inscriptions of spirit. One of the most penetrating humanistic critics of religion in the modern age, Ludwig Feuerbach, in his
         Das Wesen des Christentums, explored this exact linguistic and psychological point, namely, that ideas about deities or heavenly realms are projections of the human essence and thus the alienation of human beings from themselves.20Once this projection is identified, he reasoned, alienation might be overcome. The followers of Feuerbach are many, often unknowingly, and they rarely note the roots of their protest against human servitude and illusion in the biblical traditions.21Still, there is a strategy of humanizing religion that is conjoined to the modern critique of religion. Human beings are not to strive for divinity, as Aristotle or Plato might claim, but, rather, the divine is to be decoded as an expression of human alienation. Or, as Luc Ferry argues, we have now moved to the belief that “man [is] made God.”22<br>

Abstract: It is explicitly cinema's contribution of new concepts that prompts Rodowick, in another state‐of‐the‐field article, to hitch both Deleuze and Stanley Cavell to an enterprise within “philosophy” rather than within “theory,” whose energy he declares to be drained.
         47For theory seems too programmatic and imperious, whether driven by science in Althusser's sense (Grand Theory) or by models taken from natural and cognitive science (posttheory). Defending the latter, in a rebuke to Rodowick, Malcolm Turvey proudly reminds us that once continental film studies had been deracinated from the anglophone field, thanks largely to the relentless analyses of Noël Carroll, room was cleared for specific, targeted, and useful work. Turvey runs through a litany of recent and distinct gains in theories of emotion, editing, perception, imagination, pleasure, music, comprehension, interpretation, character identification, narrative, and suspense.48While those who write books and articles in these areas invariably do so by turning to well‐developed notions in the social sciences or philosophy, they do so, Turvey believes, from the strength of their own discipline. Here he connects to something I have been advocating all along; “most of us are not philosophers, sociologists, or economists butfilmscholars. What this means is that, at the end of the day, we have to use our expertise—gained from watching large numbers of films, observing them and the response of viewers to them carefully, and learning about the contexts in which they were made and exhibited—to evaluate the theories we take from other disciplines in terms of whether they successfully explain (or not) film.”49<br>

Abstract: In the scheme of traditional ritual analysis described above, invoking this golden age is typical of ritual performances; they reflect ur‐conventions transhistorically but through the prism of the immediate situation.
            18Reference to theghazwathickens the significance of the 9/11 event, binding it to a fertile reservoir of cultural imagination. It also refashions the ritual actors as contemporary replicas of companions to the Prophet. The references to booty and safety support this, as booty and safety could not possibly have had tangible significance to ritual actors dedicated to death by suicide.19<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: And just as the play solicits sympathy with Faustus in its spectacle and its comedy, so does it invite pity for Faustus in its tragedy. Such pity emerges from a slightly different kind of theatrical identification, however. Rather than accompanying the spectator's recognition that a character shares his or her interests, pity may arise when the spectator recognizes the character's otherness, when he apprehends or infers that the character suffers inwardly in an extraordinary way. Yet in pity the spectator also identifies in some sense with the tragic character, for he feels psychic pain in his imagination of the character's suffering. For Levinas, for instance, pity, as an expression of the subject's irreducibly asymmetrical obligation to the other, is fundamental to ethics.
      34But inDoctor Faustus, pity has no salutary ethical or moral value; on the contrary, the play explicitly contrasts the quality of human pity to that of divine mercy, thereby fashioning pity for Faustus as an aesthetic response that undermines the spectator's faith in God. It is the old man who thus devalues tragic pity. After Helen leaves the stage for the first time, the old man tells Faustus that an “angel” hovers over his head “with a vial full of precious grace” to “pour” into his “soul” (5.1.54–56), and he urges Faustus to repent—to “break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears” (5.1.40)—warning him that he has endangered his inward soul “with such flagitious crimes of heinous sins / As no commiseration may expel / But mercy, Faustus, of thy Savior sweet, / Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt” (5.1.43–46). “Commiseration” is, of course, the contemporaneous word for the pity inspired by tragedy; Sidney uses it as such inThe Defense of Poesy.35The old man argues, then, that Faustus is no less damnable for being pitiful, yet his argument, orthodox as it may be, not only makes God seem somehow less compassionate than even the crudest member of the audience moved by Faustus's ~<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: What does this tensional approach look like in practice? A few noteworthy examples illustrate the scope of this collection. In her own essay, Walton destabilizes the conventional hetero-normative ordering of the disciplines. With Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, Walton seeks to reclaim the metaphysical power of the feminine (and the literary) through a genuine “honouring of difference” that stresses “alterity rather than complimentarity” via tension without hierarchy (43). She demonstrates this through brief but insightful readings of Toni Morrison’s
      Beloved(New York, 1987), Ian McEwan’sAtonement(New York, 2002), and J. M. Coetzee’sElizabeth Costello(New York, 2003). Fiona Darroch examines the politics of representation in postcolonial Caribbean literature—specifically, the various ways the literature reimagines the sacred and thereby challenges Western conceptions of the religious and the sacred that persist within comparative religious studies. Finally, John O’Connor exposes the tendency of recent theological aesthetics (following Hans Urs von Balthasar) to ignore or oversimplify aesthetics since the Enlightenment. Theology thereby assimilates aesthetics and fails to take seriously the ambiguities present in actual aesthetic experience—namely, the tensions between our experience and our understanding of beauty as revelatory, including “the possible untrustworthiness of the imagination” (123).<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: The question with which I propose to replace Adam’s—namely, can evil be spoken with immunity—can be asked not only of Eve but of several figures in
         Paradise Lost. The process of manufacturing satanic speech is a key element in the poem, one that is most vividly on display in that section of the poem (bks. 5–8) in which Satan himself is silent. It is perhaps not surprising that no one misses the poem’s most compelling figure even though he disappears for an entire third of its action. This is probably because while he is away the unfallen characters spend such a great deal of time imagining what he did or would say. Satan may leave us, but the satanic voice never does. The one figure in the poem that speaks almost as many “satanic” lines as the devil himself is Raphael. And just as the overemphasis on the satanic source of the dream voice displaces Eve as its speaker, it is likewise all too easy to lose sight of Raphael’s role as creator in these middle books. Wherever the satanic voice surfaces, Satan himself steals the show in the imagination of the reader, relegating the creative work of the actual speaker to the background.<br>

Abstract: The meaning of
         catharsisin Aristotle’sPoeticsis heavily debated, with most interpretations clustering around three key translations: purgation, purification, and clarification. In his 1599 treatise on tragicomedy, Giambattista Guarini likened catharsis to the medical procedure of purging, as neither seeks eradication of the target element but instead restoration of balance (The Compendium of Tragicomic Poetry (1599), inLiterary Criticism: Plato to Dryden, ed. Allan H. Gilbert [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1962], 517–20; see also O. B. Hardison Jr., “Three Types of Renaissance Catharsis,” inPoetics and Praxis, Understanding and Imagination: The Collected Essays of O. B. Hardison, Jr.[Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1997], 78–94). Martha C. Nussbaum has characterized catharsis as a “clearing up” or “cleaning up” of emotions (“Tragedy and Self-Sufficiency: Plato and Aristotle on Fear and Pity,” inEssays on Aristotle’sPoetics, ed. Amélie Oksenberg Rorty [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992], 280), and Gerald F. Else has argued that catharsis is a purification of the act of the character rather than a purgation of the emotions of the audience (Aristotle’s Poetics: The Argument[Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963], 230–31, 422–40). John P. Anton, critiquing Nietzsche’s reading of Aristotle’sPoetics, argues that Nietzsche was incorrect in construing catharsis as a purge of emotions, also claiming that it is a clarification of events (“Nietzsche’s Critique of Aristotle’s Theory of Tragic Emotions,” inTragedy and Philosophy, ed. N. Georgopoulos [New York: St. Martin’s, 1993], 19–38). In light of this ongoing debate about the meaning of a single Greek word, several critics have suggested other language and models through which to examine the phenomenon of audience response to tragedy—a useful critical strategy for discussing how modern audiences might conceptualize their own reaction to what they see on stage.

Abstract: Maybeck received both commissions because of the success of the palace, and both projects were influenced by it. The Packard Showroom was completed in 1926. In the brochure published for the showroom's grand opening, the creative imagination of its architect was celebrated as a perfect complement of the glamorous luxury automobile business.
         
               Unlike the palace, whose color scheme was largely pale green, yellow, and red ocher, the dealership was richly polychrome, with its exterior details imitating shiny black-and-white marble.45
            
               Accordingly, the exterior columns' bases and the capitals at the showroom were made of artificial stone, more expensive and durable than the plaster that was used for those details at the palace.46

Abstract: Review of Robert D. Romanyshyn's The Wounded Researcher: Research with Soul in Mind, New Orleans, Louisiana: Spring Journal Books, 2007. Robert Romanyshyn has written a treatise on the question of understanding that brings together the fields of phenomenology and depth psychology. Following the thought of C. G. Jung, Romanyshyn has presented an archetypal view of the dilemma of psychological research that he sees as a story of loss, mourning, descent, re-search and homecoming expressed in the mythical image of Orpheus. Going deeper into the actual process of psychological research, Romanyshyn looks to the ancient art of alchemy as providing a model of the attitude and action of imagination that most closely suits psychological life.<br>

Abstract: Buell's view in The Environmental Imagination can serve to epitomize the prevailing
consensus: "Thoreau is often thought of as Emerson's earthy opposite. But it would be
truer to imagine him as moving gradually, partially, and self-conflictedly beyond the pro-
gram Emerson outlined in Nature, which sacralized nature as humankind's mystic coun-
terpart .... Thoreau became increasingly interested in defining nature's structure, both
spiritual and material, for its own sake, as against how nature might subserve humanity,
which was Emerson's primary consideration" (117)<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Author(s): Thunder-McGuire Steve<br>
Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Publisher: Society for Utopian Studies<br>
Issue: i20719896<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jenson Michael<br>
Abstract: A recurrent misconception about the concept of utopia fails to realize fully that its essential endeavor constitutes a speculative act involving the distribution of power and resources. Consequently, utopian desire is closely linked to structures of power and can be manipulated by interests in positions of influence within these structures. It is these connections to the machinations of power that bring utopian visions their potential for social/political influence. However, these same types of links also provide avenues for these conceptions to be cynically influenced in ways that can usurp individual autonomy. The role of power and utopia can be analyzed in the formative process of a specific social structure as well as in their contribution to the conception of a common heritage or history. The "historical perspective" often serves as the foundation for the production of propaganda seeking to capture the imagination of a populace either to instigate positive social change or to legitimize an oppressive regime. Through the lens of Collingwood's philosophy of history, this article investigates the connection that the "historical consciousness" has to the attributes of power and utopia as well as the role that this relationship plays in the formation of a collective mentality. In short, it studies the essential characteristics of the bond between individuals that allows a community or collective to perpetuate itself. It also explores how the attributes of power and utopia can use latent historical perceptions to strengthen the process of ideological integration that underlies any social action or formal structure of authority.<br>

Abstract: Caryl Phillips's narrative is painfully concerned with the relationship of Empire, Colony, and the In-between; Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean; slavery, rebellion, and freedom; Men, women and children; absent or useless fathers and damaged, aimless sons. It explores what hold in common while never losing sight of the painful quotidian, the specific. It is a narrative where the picaresque shakes hands with the epic and the linearity is broken, encircled, and put fast forward or in reverse by a mise-en-abîme of sorts: the tale-within-the-tale-within-the-tale even if interrupted by the tapestry of an emergent voice that finally proposes itself as both the identity and the difference of its verbal universe. "Enter your own self and discover the world," Phillips seems to be saying, "but also go out into the world and discover yourself." Once that call is answered, fiction itself becomes another way of questioning truth as we strive for it through the paradox of a lie. That lie can be called the imagination. It can also be seen as a parallel reality. For it may be observed as a critical mirror of what passes for the truth in the world of convention. It certainly sets up a second universe of being, where the narrator, say Cambridge in Cambridge, has a reality greater, though no less important, than the host of hastily met and then forgotten people we deal with on a daily basis. It is in this sense that Phillips brings into light another way of telling in that his narrative gives weight and presence to the virtues and vices—the fugitive personalities—of our daily acquaintance. This is the prerogative of his style, which I try to discuss in this essay. It has the power to render disenchantment and pleasure without resolving the contradiction between them. In fact, what holds them in tension, as equal forces straining in opposite directions, is the artist's mature subjectivity, stripped of hubris, unashamed either of its fallibility or of the modest assurance it has gained ~<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i23353270<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Publisher: Berghahn Journals<br>
Issue: i23508848<br>
Date: 1 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Stawarska Beata<br>
Abstract: The major thesis developed in Sartre's L'imaginaire is that all imaginary acts can be subsumed under the heading of one "image family" and, therefore, that imagination as a whole can be theorized in terms of pictorial representation. Yet this theory fails to meet the objective of Sartre's study, to demonstrate that imaginary activity is not a derivative of perception but an attitude with a character and dignity of its own. The subsidiary account of imagination in terms of neutralization of belief has the advantage of not being constrained by the requirement that imaginary activity serve a purely reproductive function of bringing an absent "original" into a quasi presence and, thus, leaves room for free creativity and fiction. It also points to a concrete lived experience of alterity at the heart of subjective life where the subject stages its life as if it were the life of an other, putting pressure onto Sartre's contention that the cogito defines subjectivity.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines the role of narrative as a basic linguistic form in communication. It is suggested that what clients say, and the case histories that emerge, can be understood in terms of 'fictional' genres. Reference is made to their role in the construction of social work accounts. The author indicates the complex nature of description, the need for increased sensitivity to different kinds of descriptive account and to the part of language and imagination in the making of accounts.<br>

Abstract: The city is a key location of the modern social world, a home of rootlessness and transient everyday encounters between individuals. This essay explores the idea of 'the sanctuary' as a way in which people look for anchorage, and create and re-create images of a society, to cope with and negotiate life in the city. It mainly draws on Durkheim's work on ritual, symbolism and the sacred, together with his account of individual and collective representations. But it also discusses these concerns though other writers, notably Freud and Ricœur, and it draws on Kant's theory of art to introduce how Durkheim sees ritual —especially sacred drama — as at once a symbolism and an aesthetics, complete with the energies of a free creative 'surplus'. Even if in the end 'the sanctuary' is unequal to the marketplace, it is a necessary refuge of the transformative social imagination and a realm, not of everyday economics, but of civitas.<br>

Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: The correlation of narrative and ethics has a long history in literature, and frequently ethics has been associated with a transcendental notion of truth. The recent attention to narrative and theology has offered more theoretical reflections of both poetic and hermeneutical practices that return us to the earliest literary, philosophical and theological productions. In this essay, I wish to present a different way of examining the correlation of narrative and ethics; one less orientated towards Scripture and less concerned with the Church. The narratives I consider are secular fictions from the modernist period. Through examining these works phenomenologically and the role the imagination plays in the production of beliefs, I argue that all narratives structure emotions, desires and hopes and this structuring continually opens up a transcendent horizon.<br>

Article Title: HOW LITERATURE RESISTS SECULARITY<br>
Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917944<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Abstract: De l'habitude, p. 49 gibt Ravaisson zwei charakteristische Stellen: „Dans
l'homme, le progrès de l'habitude conduit la conscience, par une dégradation non
interrompue, de la volonté à l'instinct, et de l'unité accomplie de la personne à
l'extrême diffusion de l'impersonnalité. C'est donc une seule force, une seule
intelligence qui est dans la vie de l'homme le principe de toutes les fonctions et de
toutes les formes de la vie." — „... avec les conditions de l'espace et du mouve-
ment disparaissent celles de la réflexion et de la mémoire. Les fonctions les plus
involontaires de notre vie, celles de la nutrition, par exemple, ne sont pas des habi-
tudes anciennes, transformées en instincts. Non seulement nous ne voyons pas
qu'elles aient jamais dépendu de notre volonté, mais jamais elles n'en ont pu
dépendre; elles se composent de mouvements insensibles et d'altérations organiques
qui sont hors de la sphère de l'imagination et de l'entendement. Mais l'habitude
amène au même point les mouvements volontaires, et les transforme en instincts."<br>

Author(s): BROTHERS ROBYN F.<br>
Abstract: Current debates surrounding liberalism and communitarianism, modernity and postmodernity, ethical theory and narrative ethics fail to account for shifting foundations of personal identity in an increasingly computer-mediated era of human communication. This paper aims to examine some of the conceptual assumptions about identity and community which are being radically undermined by rapidly evolving information networks and are therefore in need of redefinition. Additionally, I argue for an expansion of the literary imagination to include virtual, coauthored fiction sites where exploration of personal identity will bear upon future ethical and political decision-making.<br>

Author(s): STEELE MEILI<br>
Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Abstract: The reference to Spinoza is not at all far-fetched as Althusser himself is
seeking a closer affinity with Spinoza's teaching in the matter of the various kinds
of knowledge. See H. Manschot, Althusser over het marxisme (Althusser on mar-
xism), dissertation, University of Groningen, 1979, Chapter IX, 1 ('De Imaginatio
bij Spinoza') ('The Imagination in Spinoza') and 2 ('Althussers gebruik van de
spinozistiese ideologietheorie') ('Althusser's use of the spinozistic theory of
ideology').<br>

Abstract: Think for instance of the différence between being touched and touching oneself; the
'otherness' that is present in being touched is what fulfils; touching oneself may give a sense of
safety or be self-assuring or exciting, but always via conscious or non-conscious memories or
the use of imagination; memories and imaginations in other words that imply the existence of
others, real orimagined.<br>

Abstract: In her lecture "The Place of Imagination" (1994) Roberts confesses that her return to her figures of
mother and daughter is meant to evoke part of her childhood in France, a time which she recreates as paradise:
"They stand in, these images of lost bliss, as images of something even more specific than childhood: she who
is paradise itself for the baby, the growing child: the mother" ([1994] 1998, 20). For a thorough review of
this topic in Roberts's fiction, see Laura Lojo's recent article on the notion of the maternal body as paradise in
Robert's short story "Charity" (1994). She claims that this perspective is adopted by a narrator who positions
herself as a child, and whose vision is "dependant on language, memory and mythic reconstructions of her own
past" (Lojo 2012, 33).<br>

Publisher: West Chester University<br>

Author(s): Templeton Alice<br>
Abstract: What is the use of writing poems against war if they reenact rather than alter the binaries and brutalities of the war imagination they claim to protest? Why does so much contemporary war poetry only compound war's depleting effect instead of offering us energy for resistance? In The Life of Poetry (1949), Muriel Rukeyser defines poetry as a vital but underused national resource for a culture dominated by war. As a creative transfer of energy, poetry complicates and resists habits of imagination that sustain war. Using Rukeyser's analysis to contrast a representative poem from the volume Poets Against the War (2003) to several poems by Forche, Celan, James Wright, Blake, Yeats, Oppen, and Levertov, this paper discusses ways in which poetry about war and wartime can provide useful, life-giving energy without replicating the very violences it claims to oppose.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i25501821<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Emery Jacob<br>
Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Abstract: Kearney thus summarizes Kant's "Copernican Revolution": "Being would henceforth
be conceived not as the transcendent origin of meaning, but as a representation of the human
subject—or, more precisely, as a production of the human imagination. This is what Kant had
in mind when he affirmed that 'being is not a real predicate . . . but only the positing of a
thing'" (Wake 157-58<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i25654803<br>

Author(s): Passos José Luiz<br>
Abstract: It has become commonplace to describe Machado de Assis's characters and narrators as deeper than those of his contemporaries, and his novels as representations more creatively ambiguous than most literary depictions of nineteenth-century Brazil. In this essay I argue that throughout his novels psychological depth is a function of moral imagination; and a troubled moral imagination is a necessary condition for the literary representation of the modern self. Machado's protagonists are able to fashion the public presentation of their selves by imagining alternatives to their origins, desires, and social predicaments. They have in their pasts a burden they need to overcome, and while doing so they find themselves in conditions of freedom and harm. Evil then arises as a consequence of moral dynamism, in so far as it becomes a project for undoing the other. The genesis of a radical conception of free will and evil in Machado's narratives goes back to his translation of Victor Hugo's The Toilers of the Sea (1866). His concern with a more meticulous characterization of inwardness deepens between Iaiá Garcia (1878) and Dom Casmurro (1899), when adopting the structure of a confessional narrative he arrives at a balance between disguised motives (malice), double chronology (nostalgia), and human life as an unfolding, reversible, and self-aware process (metamorphosis). To frame Machado's strategy for depicting moral change, I take from Augustine's Confessions the suggestion that retrospection is the only way of restoring the identity of someone whose self is marked by his or her sense of dissimilarity with the past. Finally, from Kant and Paul Ricoeur I draw the elements for a further consideration of evil as an invitation to think differently about seeing, judging, and narrating human life.<br>

Issue: i25728283<br>

Abstract: This article highlights two features of Qur'anic style and content: duality/opposition and typological figuration, which can be seen as providing a continuous and consistent 'narrative stream' through the Qur'an. It is of some interest that both of these features have been singled out as distinctive of apocalypse as a genre in the study of numerous religious and cultural traditions. As debate on whether or not the Qur'an is a bona fide example of apocalyptic literature quietly continues, the interplay of conceptual and substantive oppositions and dualities is discussed in order to highlight the importance of this prominent feature to both the form and contents of the Book. It is suggested that its function is profoundly related to the typological figuration indispensable to the Qur'anic depiction of, for example, the character of the prophets and therefore prophethood. Whether or not this represents a genuine instance of apocalyptic literature, it nonetheless remains that the prominence of the motif renders the Qur'an susceptible of a reading expressive of something called an apocalyptic imagination. It is hoped that this article succeeds in demonstrating that in fact these apparently familiar subjects are stimulated to new life by considering them as defining, interlocking, structural elements of a distinctive Islamic apocalypse. ‮تبرز هذه الدراسة خاصيتين لأسلوب القرآن ومادته: الثنائية/التقابل وتصنيف النماذج مما قد ينظر إليه على أنه يمثل تيارا مستمرا ثابتا في القرآن. ومن اللافت للنظر أنه قد جرى الترکيز على هاتين الخاصيتين على أنهما يختصان بالحديث عن أحوال الآخرة في کثير من الأديان والتقاليد الثقافية. وفي هذا المقال سندرس التفاعل بين الثنائية والتقابل لکي نبرز الأهمية الأساسية لهذه الخاصية بالنسبة لشکل القرآن ومحتواه. فنحن نرى أن وظيفتها تمت بقوة إلى ظاهرة تصنيف الأنواع في تصوير القرآن لشخصيات الأنبياء ثم النبوة نفسها. والأمل أن ينجح هذا المقال في التدليل على أن هذه الموضوعات المألوفة يمکن رؤيتها على أنها نمط إسلامي فريد في الحديث عن الأخرويات.‬<br>

Author(s): Warren Peter A.<br>
Abstract: Albert Camus's political philosophy of rebellion and limits is ultimately grounded in an aesthetic theory, which in turn is dependent on a broader understanding of the nature of symbols. In his essays and notes. Camus develops a theory of symbols in which he insists that human beings are symbolic creatures and that human experience and symbolization are interdependent realities. Camus felt that art, in particular the philosophical novel, played a significant role in the rearticulation of symbols. The basis of the recollection or the creation of symbols is the consciousness of the community, particularly the shared consciousness of the human condition. Symbols act as mediations between the empirical world and the world of imagination. They are not literal descriptions of that empirical reality, nor are they simply flights of fancy. Symbols are necessarily bound and free. So, too, Camus argues, must be the politics on which they are based.<br>

Abstract: Socrate, "Vois plutôt cette autre objection qui s'avance, et considère par où nous
l'écarterons. — Théétète : Quelle objection, donc ? — Socrate : Une de ce genre, soit la
question : Supposons qu'on soit venu à savoir quelque chose ; que de cet objet même on ait
encore, on conserve, le souvenir ; est-il possible que, à ce moment-là, quand on se le rappelle,
on ne sache pas cela même qu'on se rappelle ? [...] Mais j'ai l'air de me lancer dans un grand
discours : ce que je veux demander, c'est si une fois qu'on a appris quelque chose, on ne le
sait pas quand on se le rappelle." (Platon, Théétète, Paris, Flammarion, 1994, trad, par
M. Narcy, [163d] p. 182.) "Et comment, Socrate ? réplique Théétète, ce serait monstrueux ce
que tu dis." De cette réponse embarrassée surgit une question plus aiguë : "Sans plus tarder,
crois-tu qu'on te concédera que chez un sujet quelconque, le souvenir présent de ce qu'il a
éprouvé soit une impression semblable, pour lui qui ne l'éprouve plus, à ce qu'il a une fois
éprouvé ? Il s'en faut de beaucoup." (Ibid., [166b] p. 190.) Question insidieuse, qui entraîne
toute la problématique dans ce qui apparaîtra plus tard comme un piège, à savoir le recours
à la catégorie de similitude pour résoudre l'énigme de la présence de l'absence, énigme
commune à l'imagination et à la mémoire, comme le choix du vocable eikôn le souligne. Je
ne suivrai pas les protagonistes du dialogue dans l'examen de la solution proposée, à savoir
le modèle de l'empreinte dans la cire, laquelle ne fait que redoubler l'énigme, dans la mesure
où toutes les empreintes sont présentes, actuelles, et où il leur est demandé de se comporter
en tant que signes de leur cause, à savoir l'événement de la frappe de l'empreinte.<br>

Abstract: Alexis Kagame in Les cultures et le temps, Paris, Payot/Unesco, 1975,
p. 120. Cela se produit dans d'autres cultures par ailleurs très différentes.
« En Hindoustani moderne... l'adverbe kal veut dire à la fois » hier « et
« demain ». Parson désigne tout aussi bien après-demain qu'avant-hler ;
atar son signifie tout autant il y a trois Jours que dans trois Jours. Seul le
contexte donne le sens » (Hajime Nakamura, Time in Indian and Japanese
thought, in The Voices of Time, op. cit., p. 81) (ma trad. W. G.).
L'auteur relève que dans la pensée indienne le temps, tout comme d'autres
phénomènes, est conçu de manière plutôt statique que dynamique et il cons-
tate aussi le manque d'intérêt des Indiens pour l'histoire, le manque de
conscience historique. Dans des ouvrages comme le Mahavamsa de l'ancienne
Ceylan, les légendes se mêlent aux faits historiques précisément décrits.
mais sans dates, ou bien comme dans Raj atar angini, chronique des dynasties
du Cachemire, les dates sont inadéquates ou un pur produit de l'Imagination
(pp. 81-82).
Le travail souvent cité de Benjamin Lee Whorf sur les Hopis de l'Arizona
révèle également une représentation du temps qui ne manque pas de nous
surprendre. Leur langage ne contient aucun vocabulaire qui se réfère au
temps ou à aucun de ses aspects. Les verbes n'ont pas de temps, toutes les
actions s'expriment au présent. Aucune distinction n'apparaît entre le passé
et le présent. L'idée du futur ne se trouve que dans des expressions subjec-
tives manifestant l'attente, le souhait, l'intention, liées le plus souvent avec
une action qui commence. Cf. An American Indian Model of the Universe, In
Language, Thought and Reality, Cambridge, Mass., mit press, 1956, pp. 57-64.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Publisher: Irish University Review<br>
Issue: i29777260<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Author(s): Gordon Peter Eli<br>
Abstract: Habermas eloquently summarizes Cassirer's view: "The position of human being
in the world is defined by a form-giving power which transforms sense impressions into
meaningful structures. Human beings master the forces of nature which rush in upon them
through symbols which spring from the productive imagination. Thus they gain a distance
from the immediate pressure of nature. Of course, they pay for this emancipation with their
mental dependence on a semanticized nature, which returns in the spellbindingforce of myth-
ical images. That first act of distantiation must therefore be repeated in the course of cultural
development."<br>

Issue: i30116051<br>
Date: 3 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Vincent Gilbert<br>
Abstract: Reflections by scientists, philosophers and sociologists upon the role of science as the motor of modern history show that apocalyptics can be interpreted neither as irrationalism nor as rhetorical, emphatic speech. Speaking out of the imagination, apocalyptics takes the form of a discourse that is hypercritical of and the least inexact about science, whenever scientific successes have rendered the habitual distinction between reality and model untenable. The imaginary realm of apocalyptics follows upon utopia and science fiction. However it has to be separated from "catastrophism". The latter still takes science to be a messiah because its idea of scientific develop. ment conceals favorable future effects underneath presentday catastrophic consequences. By refusing to separate intentions and effects and by objectifying science as a "totalizing" power, apocalyptics, on the other hand, leads to an irreversible situation that identifies history and destiny. Not only the semantic contents of the apocalyptic discourse are examined but also its "pragmatic" value is weighed. Its paradoxical declarations assume the form of a discourse whose proclamation has a meaning-an instituting scope-that literally contradicts its content, the proclaimed "non-sense" of science.<br>

Article Title: Live Metaphor in the Age of Cognitivist Reduction<br>
Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154135<br>
Date: 12 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Statkiewicz Max<br>
Abstract: The article resituates Ricur's theory of métaphore vive in the contemporary context of the so-called "cognitive revolution." The latter denomination is highly misleading. There is nothing revolutionary about the cognitivist study of metaphor as a general pattern of thought; just like the discipline of rhetoric that was already on the decline in l8th century Europe, it is conservative in its validation of everyday, ideologically charged language as the model for all language, including that of poetry and art. Riceur’s conception of "live metaphor," on the other hand, does justice to the "revolutionary" character of poetic language, its function of breaking the order of "commonplaces we live by"—and are ruled by. A "poem in miniature," metaphor constitutes the model for any "poietic," creative imagination. Resulting from a clash, disturbing the common everyday language, live metaphor (and poetry in general) projects a world in such a way as to render strange and thus question the world we live in.<br>

of clearly estimating the deductions of our own, an imagination which should enter into and seize upon
the subtle and delicate peculiarities which we have delighted to cherish and unfold in secret..." (Shelley's

Publisher: Nanzan Institute of Religion and Culture<br>
Issue: i30233809<br>
Date: 1 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Bathgate Michael<br>
Abstract: As a literature of exemplars, Pure Land sacred biography presents the reader with the ideals of a community as much as the events of individual lives. The models for the religious life advanced in sacred biographies, however, include not only the religious practices of their protagonists, but the discursive practices of their authors, as well. The work of biography, after all, is concerned not only with depicting characters and events, but with configuring both in a meaningful form. Through a comparative reading of ōjōden and myōkōninden, this study explores some of the ways in which changes in literary form encourage different perspectives on the nature of time, causality, and community in the constitution of the religious life. These exemplary orientations to the religious life, I suggest, are a fundamental aspect of the didactic functions of these texts, and thus of their contribution to the history of Pure Land religious imagination.<br>

Issue: i354683<br>
Date: 1 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Zbikowski Martin<br>
Abstract: This article introduces a special issue of the British Journal of Ethnomusicology on "music and meaning". It does so by offering some thoughts on "meaning" in the context of north Indian rāga music and by sketching the outline of an approach to musical meaning influenced by perspectives from ethnomusicology, psychological anthropology, cognitive science and cultural studies. The article proposes that all music is necessarily meaningful insofar as it offers to the perceiving subject possibilities for action and imagination, and that meaning is wholly dependent neither on semiosis nor on the apprehension of formal or structural relationships.<br>

Article Title: A Reconsideration of Oa the Earth Goddess in William Golding's "The Inheritors"<br>
Publisher: Maney Publishing<br>
Issue: i288901<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): FreudAbstract: Although the depiction of a Neanderthal people in "The Inheritors" by William Golding is based mainly on the author's imagination and is thus anthropologically untenable, the author's treatment of Oa the earth goddess, worshipped by this tribe, is of unique value and justly represents his key concept. The reciprocity between the symbolic system and the symbol-dissolving element, both inherent in Oa, is very significant regarding cultural, religious, and psychological aspects in relation to the human beings in this novel. This reciprocity helps in the rediscovery of human potentialities that might be repressed and buried under the power structure of a given society.<br>

Journal Title: The Journal of Religious Ethics<br>
Article Title: Hermeneutics and Ethics: The Example of Reinhold Niebuhr<br>
Publisher: Religious Ethics, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40000905<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): McCann Dennis P.<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the imaginative foundations of ethics, not by presenting a theory about the moral imagination, but by reconstructing the hermeneutic strategy underlying Reinhold Niebuhr's proposal for "an independent Christian ethic." The thesis is that Niebuhr's ethic cannot adequately be evaluated without careful attention to his hermeneutics, what he described as "the mythical method of interpretation." This point is argued first, by reconstructing Niebuhr's hermeneutics; second, by showing how his hermeneutics determines the strategy of his ethics; and third, by using this focus to clarify certain issues separating Niebuhr and some of his recent critics, specifically, William Frankena's criticism of his metaethics, Gene Outka's objections to his normative ethic of love as self-sacrifice; and John Howard Yoder's rejection of the strategy of his Christian realism as a whole. The essay is presented in the hope that Niebuhr's example will encourage American religious ethicists to explore the relationship between hermeneutics and ethics with greater intellectual sympathy and theoretical sophistication. The example of Niebuhr's "independent Christian ethic" is commended as one attempt to map the formal and substantive ways in which religious visions help shape our dispositions and moral choices.<br>

Issue: i40000909<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Guevin Benedict M.<br>
Abstract: Stanley Hauerwas, in developing what he calls "an ethics of character," discusses the importance of vision, imagination, and community for the shaping of character by means of "stories." Hauerwas convincingly argues that if persons are to be Christian disciples, they must allow their own way of life to be shaped by the story of Jesus' life. What Hauerwas does not undertake to explain is how the literary impact of stories (where vision, imagination and community become operative) affects the shaping of character. In this essay, I will demonstrate how the literary impact of one type of story, viz., the parable, can affect the shaping of character.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000935<br>
Date: 3 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: Challenging a long-standing assumption of the separation of ethical from poetic activity, this essay develops the basis for a theory of moral life as inherently and radically creative. A range of contemporary post-Kantian ethicists--including Ricoeur, Nussbaum, Kearney, and Gutiérrez--are employed to make the argument that moral practice requires a fundamental capability for creative transformation, imagination, and social renewal. In addition, this poetic moral capability can finally be understood only from the primordial religious point of view of the mystery of Creation as such. Humanity as an image of its Creator is called to the endless impossible possibility of the re-creation of its own complex, plural, and fallen social world. Such a perspective is opposed to views of moral life as the application of law-like principles or the recovery of past moral histories. Without a better understanding of moral life's radically creative imperative, we miss a vital element of social relations' distinctive humanity.<br>

Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i40007298<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): McManus Helen<br>
Abstract: There is something profoundly disturbing in the concept of politics as an agon, a site of contestation, struggle, and competition. Action in a world of pervasive and irreducible conflict risks exposing the individual to the contingency of all unity, including the unity of the self, and thus forces individuals to recognize their own internal divisions and contradictions. This article considers the possibility of enduring, surviving, and excelling at agonistic politics. It asks what kind of individuality, what mode of thinking about and addressing the person's inner plurality, might provide the capacities to survive participation in the democratic agon and thus sustain democracy as a form of politics. Accounts of agonistic politics concur in imagining the individual as engaged in what might be called an inner agonism; therefore my analysis focuses on the reasons for this mimetic relationship between individuality and politics. I argue that mimesis in political imagination draws out particular sorts of affective responses, orienting the person to her political world in ways that might provide precisely the sorts of resources needed for action.<br>

Abstract: L'article passe en revue certains emplois assumés du terme fiction et écarte la conception ultra-relativiste selon laquelle tout serait fiction puisque la vérité des faits est impossible à établir et que le langage, a fortiori tout récit, sont par nature fictionnels. Envisager par ailleurs l'acception large de la notion de fiction comme quelque chose de construit se révèle peu productif car tout texte, toute oeuvre, même celle qui vise à la neutralité documentaire, peut dès lors être qualifiée de fiction. La recherche de vérité(s) doit demeurer à l'horizon des efforts des scientifiques. À cet égard, il convient de considérer la fiction artistique comme la véritable fiction. Son cadre pragmatique est celui que l'on désigne par les expressions de « feintise ludique » ou de « feintise partagée ». Sur ce plan, la fiction se distingue du faux (du mensonge), de l'erreur (de l'illusion) et de l'hypothèse (de la théorie). Si elle se distingue des discours liés aux intentions scientifiques, la fiction artistique intéresse néanmoins, en tant qu'objet, les anthropologues : imagination artistique et imaginaire collectif entretiennent en effet des relations d'influences réciproques. The ultra-relativististic conception whereby everything is fiction is shunned. It claims that the truth of facts cannot be established and that language and even more so narratives are fictional by nature. A broader acceptation of fiction as something « constructed » turns out to be of little use since any text or writing – even one with the intention of documentary neutrality – falls under the label of fiction. The quest for truth(s) must remain a scientific pursuit. In this respect, « artistic fiction » should be considered to be genuine fiction. Phrases such as « shared » or « playful pretense » refer to its pragmatic framework. Fiction thus stands apart from falsehood (lies), error (illusions) and hypothesis (theories). Though distinct from scientific intentionality, artistic fiction is of intere~<br>

Abstract: Der Strukturalismus hat den Begriff der Referenz weitgehend aus der Literatur ausgeklammert. Da nichts außerhalb des Textes sein durfte, wurde jeglicher Hinweis darauf zur (referentiellen) Täuschung erklärt. Seit den 80er und verstärkt seit den 90er Jahren hat sich dies verändert. Nach einem knappen Überblick über diese neuen Theorien der Referenz wird in diachroner Perspektive untersucht, wieso die Geographie einst Kosmographie war und die Form der Welt mit Hilfe eines Wahrscheinlichkeitsprinzips zu erzählen versuchte: Einst ging die Literatur der außersprachlichen Wirklichkeit voraus und gestaltete sie. Kann aber noch heute richtig sein, was zu Homers Zeiten galt? Durchaus -wenn man eine zu enge Vorstellung vom Verhältnis Wirklichkeit/Einbildung überwindet und davon ausgeht, dass ein Realitätselement gleichsam imaginär aufgefasst und verstanden werden kann. Während allerdings Homer mit seiner Imagination die Leere bekämpfte, ist heutzutage der Schriftsteller mit der Überfülle konfrontiert. Was aber, wenn das Noch-Leere Homers und das Saturierte der postmodernen Welt einem gemeinsamen Prinzip gehorchten?<br>

Article Title: 'Beyond Being': Emergent Narratives of Suffering in Vietnam<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i378409<br>
Date: 9 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Woodside Tine<br>
Abstract: Intertwining ethnographic and literary accounts, this article explores the mutual relationship between suffering and agency. The article describes how young Vietnamese women use narrative to find meaning in the suffering that a late-term abortion causes. Seeking to further develop anthropological use of the concept of social suffering, the article argues that existing scholarship has tended to neglect the importance of human agency and imagination, hinging as it does on suffering as entrenched within structural forces. The article contends that this neglect must be understood in the context of the particular epistemological and ethical conditions under which anthropological studies of human suffering are produced, and that closer attention to the human engagements out of which ethnographic accounts are fashioned may bring into analysis not only the harm that social forces can inflict on people, but also their capacities for action and imagination. / Mêlant ethnographic et récits littéraires, l'article explore la relation réciproque entre souffrance et agency. Il décrit comment les jeunes femmes vietnamiennes utilisent la narration pour trouver un sens à la souffrance causée par une fausse couche tardive. Visant à élargir l'utilisation anthropologique du concept de souffrance humaine, l'auteur montre que les études tendent à négliger l'importance de l'agency et de l'imagination, qui s'articule sur la souffrance enracinée dans les forces structurelles. L'auteur affirme que cette négligence doit être comprise dans le contexte de conditions épistémologiques et éthiques particulières dans lesquelles sont produites les études anthropologiques de la souffrance humaine, et qu'une analyse plus attentive des engagements humains desquels sont issus les récits ethnographiques peut introduire dans la réflexion non seulement le mal que les forces sociales peuvent infliger aux individus, mais aussi les capacités d'action et d'imagination de ceux-ci.<br>

Exécuté pour les grandes fêtes liturgiques de la cathédrale Notre-Dame, l'organum est la marque distinctive d'une élite de clercs seuls capables de produire de telles compositions. Cet article montre une pratique musicale ancrée dans un contexte intellectuel alors propice à l'ex tempore dicendi où l'apprentissage des techniques mémorielles, l'étude très poussée et le maniement virtuose de la langue latine sont au cœur du système éducatif. Des solistes émérites, rompus à la discipline intellectuelle de l'orateur, ont réussi à chanter de mémoire ces majestueuses fresques qui ont enflammé l'imagination des médiévaux.<br>

Author(s): Fellous Michèle<br>
Abstract: Le Quilt possède une double dimension, singulière et militante : chaque panneau, chaque nom énoncé lors du déploiement signifie l'unicité de chaque disparu ; mais l'assemblage des patchworks, leur abandon à l'association qui va les recueillir, les assembler et les utiliser pour porter à l'attention du monde entier l'énormité de la catastrophe renvoie à la dimension sociale inhérente au décès de chaque individu mort du sida. Le développement fulgurant du rite du patchwork aux États-Unis s'explique par ce double enjeu et par la réappropriation de symboles fondateurs de l'imaginaire américain. En se réappropriant un symbole commun, le Quilt légitime et réintègre la communauté gay porteuse du projet dans cette société qui l'a niée. The Quilt has from the outset both a singular and militant dimension : each panel, each name mentioned during the unfolding means the uniqueness of each dead ; but the assembled patchworks, their donation to the association which will conserve, assemble and use them to draw worldwide attention to this dreadful disaster refer to the social dimension inherent to each individual having died of AIDS. The extremely rapid development of the patchwork rite in the United States can be explained by these two functions and within the reappropriation of founding symbols of the Americans'world of imagination. By reappropriating a common symbol the Quilt legitimates and reintegrates the gay community, bearer of the project, into a society from which it was rejected. Von Anfang an hat der Quilt eine eigenartige und zugleich militante Dimension. Jeder Teil des Patchworks, jeder Name, der während der Entfaltung ausgesprochen wird, besagt die Eigenartigkeit jedes Gestorbenen. Doch verweisen das Zusammenfügen der Patchworkwerke und ihre Überlassung dem Verein, der sie bewahren, zusammenfügen und verwenden wird, um die Aufmerksamkeit der ganzen Welt auf diese schreckliche Katastrophe zu lenken, auf die dem Tode jedes AIDSkranken inhärente soziale Dimension.

Abstract: La sociabilité méridionale offre l'occasion d'un débat pluri-transdisciplinaire dont l'auteur, à la suite des historiens et des ethnologues, a tenté d'établir une typologie. Il s'agira d'approfondir la dimension politique dont certains cercles de villages font preuve, tant par leur action au sein d'une démocratie participative que par un ensemble de pratiques recourant à la notion de légitimité. Parmi ces mécanismes de contre-pouvoir, le patrimoine politique dont le cercle est le symbole recouvre la notion d'un imaginaire qui trouve à la fois ses sources dans l'histoire locale et dans la mémoire nationale. The southern sociability offers the opportunity of a pluri-transdisciplinary debate of which the author, following historians and ethnologists, tried to establish a typology. The purpose here is to better define the political dimension of some village circles revealed both through their action within a participative democracy and a set of practices appealing to the notion of legitimacy. Among these counterpower mechanisms the political heritage symbolised by the circle covers the notion of imagination rooted both in the local history and the national memory. Die südfranzösische Geselligkeit bietet die Gelegenheit einer inter- und transdisziplinären Debatte. Der Autor hat versucht, deren Typologie zu erstellen, dabei Historikern und Ethnologen folgend. Es handelt sich hier darum, die politische Dimension näher zu bestimmen, die einige Dorfkreise durch ihre Tätigkeit innerhalb einer partizipativen Demokratie sowie durch eine Gesamtheit von Praktiken aufzeigen, die den Begriff der Legitimität in Anspruch nehmen. Unter diesen Gegenkraftsmechanismen umfasst das durch den Kreis symbolisierte politische Erbe den Begriff der Vorstellungswelt, die in der lokalen Geschichte und dem nationalen Gedächtnis gewurzelt ist.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40048276<br>
Date: 9 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Keck Frédéric<br>
Abstract: En lisant l'œuvre de Lévy-Bruhl à travers le problème de la causalité mentale, on voit que le concept de participation, emprunté à la philosophie de Malebranche, lui permet de dépasser l'opposition entre deux conceptions : — d'une part, la « causalité naturelle » , empruntée à Tylor et à Tassociationnisme britannique, qui explique les opérations magiques par des erreurs intellectuelles ; — d'autre part, la « causalité sociale » , élaborée par Durkheim et la sociologie française, qui explique les phénomènes moraux et religieux par l'intervention de la « société » comme sujet collectif. Le concept de participation désigne un mode de causalité qui opère au niveau de l'expérience naturelle sans lui ajouter un niveau surnaturel et proprement social : « Cette analyse est comparable à celle de l'imagination chez Bergson et éclaire la réception ambivalente de Lévy-Bruhl dans la phénoménologie et dans le structuralisme. » Reading Lévy-Bruhl's work through the topic of mental causality, one sees that the concept of participation – borrowed from Malebranche's philosophy – enables him to overpass the opposition between two conceptions : — on the one hand, « natural causality », borrowed from Tylor and British associationnism, which accounts for magical operations through intellectual mistakes, and — on the other hand, « social causality », elaborated by Durkheim and French sociology, which accounts for moral and religious events through the intervention of society as a collective subject. The concept of participation refers to a mode of causality which works on the level of natural experience without adding to it a supernatural and specifically social level: « This analysis can be compared to that of imagination by Bergson, and throws a light on the ambivalent reception of Lévy-Bruhl by phenomenology and structuralism. »<br>

Author(s): GUITE JANGKHOMANG<br>
Abstract: This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.<br>

Issue: i384292<br>

Author(s): Whyte Jack<br>
Abstract: In a variety of ways, all ethnographies are politically cast and policy relevant. Each of three recurrent political rhetorics is related to a unique set of fieldwork practices. Ethnographies that report holistically on journeys to "the other side" build policy/political significance by contesting popular stereotypes. Theoretical ethnographies draw on political imagination to fill in for a lack of variation in participant observation data and to model an area of social life without attempting to rule out alternative explanations. Comparative analytic studies build political relevance by revealing social forces that are hidden by local cultures. Each of these three genres of ethnographic methodology faces unique challenges in relating fieldwork data to politically significant explanations. By shaping the ethnographers relations to subjects and readers, each methodology also structures a distinctive class identity for the researchers-as worker, as aristocrat, or as bourgeois professional.<br>

Abstract: The political impact of "social acceleration" has recently attracted much attention in sociology and political theory. The concept, however, has remained entirely unexplored in the discipline of history. Although numerous British historians have noted the prominent position of acceleration in the late-Victorian and Edwardian imagination, these observations have never expanded beyond the realm of rhetorical flourish. The present paper attempts to build a two-way interdisciplinary bridge between British political history and the theories of social acceleration that have been posited in the social sciences, arguing that both British political historians and acceleration theorists have much to gain from further dialogue.<br>

Abstract: A análise da construção de figuras femininas como Leonor Teles e Filipa de Lencastre nas crónicas de Fernão Lopes, requer uma metodologia metahistórica como a proposta por Hayden White em Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe e The Content of the Form. Só assim é possível encontrar o comentário social, cultural, político e até histórico aí subjacente. Os quatro "modes of emplotment" e "explanation by emplotment" propostos por White revelam que a narrativa da estória de Leonor está estruturada como tragédia enquanto que a de Filipa é típica de romance medieval. A mensagem histórico-política entretecida por Lopes nas estórias destas rainhas aponta para a responsabilidade de Leonor em causar a queda da primeira dinastia portuguesa, enquanto Filipa é louvada como mãe de uma nova dinastia abrindo uma era de paz e prosperidade. O objectivo último do cronista é justificar a aclamação problemática de D. João I.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive semantics postulates that specific mental mechanisms belonging to the human imagination, namely metaphorical and metonymical mappings, are involved in semantic changes. Nevertheless, a thorough examination reveals the weakness of this theory. I therefore advocate a radically different analysis which allows us to do without these postulated cognitive mechanisms. Systematizing Meillet's observations about the role of « discontinuity in transmission » in semantic change, I propose, for each case studied, to look for what circumstances in collective experience can make the discrepancy between the new and the former meaning imperceptible to the speakers themselves. I argue that a semantic change at its decisive moment must most often perform in a covert way, without its instigators' knowledge. The efficiency and heuristic fruitfulness of this method is illustrated in this paper by the study of certain Latin polysemous words expressing not only a physical bond but also a juridical obligation (obligare, obligatio, nectere, obstringere, solvere, absolvere).<br>

Publisher: Philosophy Documentation Center<br>
Issue: i40080131<br>
Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Deslandes Ghislain<br>
Abstract: The analysis of narrative processes and metaphorical language are the topics generally focused on by business ethics researchers interested in the work of Paul Ricœur. Yet his work on political questions also applies to the ethical issues associated with organizations. Ricœur's ethical enterprise can be expressed as a triad composed of ideological, deontological, and sapiential levels, associating ostensibly opposing positions of Aristotelian and Kantian origin. In this study, I examine politics, economics, and ethics in their dialectic relation as established by Ricœur. Against a vertical, mechanistic, and axiologically neutral vision of management, he opposes the two conceptual pairs of conviction/imagination and ideology/utopia as well as a superior definition of justice associating reciprocal indebtedness and mutual disinterestedness. Through this analysis, it becomes clear that the vertical, hierarchical nature of politics tends to undermine the horizontal interactions necessary to procure just institutions in society. And any business ethic that does not acknowledge political tensions will be mute. What is needed instead is practical wisdom that is developed through interaction, and often through conflict, involving all the different players.<br>

Article Title: Dystopian Visions and Utopian Anticipations: Terry Bisson's "Pirates of the Universe" as Critical Dystopia<br>
Publisher: SF-TH Inc.<br>
Issue: i394211<br>
Date: 11 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Zamyatin Peter G.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the interplay of dystopian and utopian themes in Terry Bisson's "Pirates of the Universe," utilizing Tom Moylan's concept of "critical dystopia." In the novel, Bisson maps out a number of discontinuous dystopias in a near-future US marked by rampant capitalist enterprise, out-of-control bio-technology, ecological decay, and a weak central state. These dystopias generally produce citizens with fragmented personal experiences, disinterest in social issues, and limited aspirations. Towards the end of the novel, when free and clean energy becomes available to all, Bisson explores continuing dystopian trends, articulates utopian possibilities, and emphasizes the importance of individual and collective imagination for choosing among alternatives.<br>

Author(s): Kotásek Miroslav<br>
Abstract: This article discusses the options that narrative and language have in their attempts to capture or describe traumatic experience and death. It concentrates on two prose texts by Karel Čapek, Obyčejný život and Povětroň, and the first phase of Freudian psychoanalysis, pointing at generally distinguishable limits and distortions that arise when narrative and language come in contact with trauma and death. Contrary to the current trend within „trauma studies“ , the article does not deal with autobiographical records of traumatic experience. It rather tries to point out that thinking consistently about the connection between memory, language and trauma tends to blur and question the traditional distinction between fiction (understood as a work of imagination) and autobiography (taken as a description of real events). It also tries to show that psychoanalysis arrives, explicitly and implicitly, at a similar conclusion. The last part of the article poses the question what the resulting relationship between the outside (narrated, written Story) and the „inner“ experience is like, and to what extent the structure of this dyad can also be questioned.<br>

Author(s): Clayton Cam<br>
Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113399<br>
Date: 4 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Haney David P.<br>
Abstract: In the apostrophe to "Imagination" in The Prelude, Book 6, a multileveled usurpation occurs which challenges the rhetorical foundation of Wordsworth's poem. The force of will exhibited in this passage is a paradoxical combination of actively exerted power and effortlessness, forced interruption and passively suffered usurpation, in which both the agent and the object of usurpation are put into question. The essential trope in this gesture is the anomalous figure of catachresis, whose uneasy place in eighteenth-century rhetorical classifications resulted from its combination of absolute propriety and absolute impropriety. For Wordsworth, this trope reveals the paradoxical connection between the powerful ground of the imagination's proper being and the abyss of loss and impropriety which threatens the imaginative will.<br>

Abstract: Afin de justifier l'élaboration et l'usage d'une phénoménologie de l'imagination poétique, on montrera comment le langage poétique permet selon le mot de P. Ricoeur « d'articuler une expérience fictive » en dégageant l'« illusion » qui s'attache à la lecture de l'objet poétique. Avec Bachelard on verra comment l'image poétique apparaît comme une aurore de parole et un être nouveau. On verra comment le phénoménologue n'oublie jamais que l'expérience poétique situe le poème dans « le pays de la vérité » et s'efforce de le saisir comme essence, Wesenschau. Mais comme d'autre part une illusion fondamentale s'attache à la lecture de l'œuvre poétique, on évoquera la pensée de Nietzsche qui se déploie dans le jeu de l'illusion et de la vérité. L'artiste est cet illusionniste sublime qui nous fait sentir comme réel le monde des phénomènes. On terminera par une définition du poète comme celui qui nomme et par sa nomination fait être, fait l'Être apparaissant et transparent. To justify a phenomenology of poetic imagination we show how through poetical language a fictitious experience can be articulated, as says P. Ricoeur, by sifting out the « illusion » which pertains to the reading of the poetical object. According to Bachelard poetical image appears as a dawn of words and a new being. The phenomenologist never forgets that according to poetical experience a poem dwells in the « land of truth » and should be grasped as an essence, « Wesenschau ». But, as a fundamental illusion clings to the reading of a poetical work, we shall remember Nietzsche whose thought dwells in the play of illusion and truth. Thanks to the artist as a sublime conjurer we feel real the world of phenomena. To end, a poet is someone who names and, by doing so, makes being appearing and transparent.<br>

Abstract: The article explores the implications of communist representations of history as it relates to representation and evidence in historical theory. It investigates the attempts of the party historians to establish a historical connection between the "counterrevolutions" of 1919 and 1956: as they argued, the counterrevolution that had been born in 1919 and ruled the country until 1945 and, subsequently, been forced "underground" by the Soviet Red Army and the new communist power, was able to "resurrect itself" once again in 1956. It examines how they attempted to authenticate this historical abstraction through various historical, mostly visual, records: photography, film and exhibitions. The article argues that an unusual attitude towards evidence prevailed in these historical works. Although communist historians boasted of referring to an abundance of original source material, their narrative frames of representation proved to be fictitious: sources were selected not in order to draw conclusions regarding historical processes, but instead to illustrate various pre-figured abstract constructions of history. The aim of this method was to maintain the separation of the empirical source base and the philosophical-theological imagination surrounding the meanings of history in order to unbind the latter from evidence and tie it to political ideologies and commitments.<br>

Article Title: A Discourse on Theory II: Three Tyrannies of Contemporary Theory and the Alternative of Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132187<br>
Date: 10 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Corner James<br>
Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Article Title: Fragments of a Poetic of Gardens<br>
Publisher: The University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i40132217<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Conan Michel<br>
Abstract: The renewal of a dialog between landscape design and garden history demands a renewal of the questions and methods of garden history. This essay studies how garden reception and garden creation interact. It considers three main issues: first, it explores the domain of cultural expectations framing the engagement with a garden shared by users and creators at a given time—the poetical texture of gardens; second, the role of garden creation in exploiting, expanding or subverting this shared frame of expectations; and third, it proposes an approach—garden pragmatic—to study the broader interactions between garden creation and reception on the one hand, and social and cultural change on the other. The question of intersubjectivity—how do we share our sense and experiences of the world with others, and how do we transform them—is at the root of all the little stories—the fragments of a poetic of gardens—that propose new directions for garden history. Many of these stories have been presented during the last 15 years at symposia at Dumbarton Oaks where the author is presently the director of Garden and Landscape Studies. The general philosophy however had never been presented until the Fall 2004 when he published his "Essais de Poétique des Jardins." They were never made explicit at Dumbarton Oaks where each story only played its part in the theme of the symposium. Yet the whole course of ideas presented here results from these many exchanges with other scholars. This is why many footnotes make explicit references to their works. So, following the lead offered by this text or choosing a personal route, each reader may access many different voices that make garden history at present into a lively resource for pondering about the role of landscape creation in a multicultural world. These fragments of history are written to stimulate the designer's imagination, not to outline the course landscape design should follow.<br>

Author(s): Ghosh Shreya<br>
Abstract: If nations are "imagined communities" as many theorists like to define them, then they need an ideology to create a cohesive imagination. In modern times, the project of writing "history" has been an important instrument in the service of this ideological purpose of justifying and reproducing the modern nation-state as the predestined and legitimate container of collective consciousness. School textbooks, at least in South Asia, have long been among the most exploited media for the presentation of the history of the national collective. This essay is a study of school textbooks in Bangladesh. It looks at narrative representations of selected episodes from the past, both pre- and postindependence, in order to reflect on how they construct "history". Through this work I endeavor to relate textual images to issues of community relations and identity by identifying and sharing the ways in which the audience for nationalist discourse is created, nurtured, and secured through symbolic means.<br>

Abstract: This article draws attention to the ways in which Western psychiatric models of psychopathology applied to the so-called "Cargo cults" of Melanesia have served to endorse colonial and cultural discourses of power. It argues that while the ethnographic evidence indicates the positive and creative potential of such movements, Western assumptions concerning irrationality and the unconscious mind obscure this potential. The concept of autonomous imagination is proposed as a way of understanding these movements without pathologizing them.<br>

Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>

Abstract: An alternative optic on contemporary writing becomes available if we look back to Latin America nearly one hundred years ago. At the same time as the “Cannibalist Manifesto” was being written and circulated in Brazil, the polemic surrounding the reception of the Spanish-speaking poetic vanguard clustered around three major issues: the significance of technique; the existence of genuine novelty in avant-garde poetry; and creative sincerity and profundity.
         
               Consider, alongside the “Cannibalist Manifesto,” another, earlier founding document of Latin American letters, a short text by José Martí. Martí, an originator of54
            modernismoand a revolutionary leader in the Cuban struggle for independence, introduced a late nineteenth-century volume of his poems with a prose piece that declares, “These are my verses. I borrowed them from no one.”
               He continues:55
            
               Martí invokes Aristotelian mimesis as crucial to the writing of a poem: in this tale of literary composition, the writer filters reality and imagination and copies his perceptions onto the page. Yet the process of “copying” does not introduce any falsehood or deception. Quite to the contrary, Martí stakes out a poetics of sincerity and authenticity rooted in his own physical person, springing from his “own blood” rather than intellectual abstraction or a hodgepodge of combinatoric procedures. Martí states that the writer himself serves as his own warrant of truth, his own guarantor, because he has acquired knowledge through sensory experience (“None of them has emerged from my mind, warmed over, artful and beautified; they have come like tears springing from the eyes or blood spurting out from a wound…. I did not stitch together bits of this and that, but cut deep into myself. These poems emerged written not in academic ink but in my own blood. Whatever I place on view here I once have seen (
            Ihave seen it: me), and I have seen much~<br>

Abstract: There is much to admire in
      Against World Literature, but I often found myself wishing that Apter had developed her arguments further by opening out more beyond her own cultural and theoretical comfort zone. Throughout her book, “World Literature” is taken to be a unified entity, practiced largely in translation by American academics; no mention is made of the ambitious publication projects undertaken in Japan over the course of the past century, in China since the end of the Cultural Revolution, or in countries as varied as Estonia, Poland, Portugal, and South Korea in more recent years. Within English-language scholarship, Apter rarely discusses work published in the past decade, even though scholars of world literature increasingly focus on complexities of translation and on the cultural politics of transmission and reception. No mention is made, for instance, of Mads Rosendahl Thomsen'sMapping World Literature(Bloomsbury, 2008), Ursula Heise'sSense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global(Oxford, 2008), Djelal Kadir'sMemos from the Besieged City: Lifelines for Cultural Sustainability(Stanford, 2010), or Jacob Edmond'sA Common Strangeness: Contemporary Poetry, Cross-cultural Encounter, Comparative Literature(Fordham, 2012). A treatment of untranslatability from a broad temporal and cultural perspective can be found in Ronit Ricci's remarkable bookIslam Translated(Chicago, 2011), which opens with a chapter on “‘Translation’ and its Untranslatability,” exploring the implications of the fact that the very term “translation” has no direct translation in Arabic, Tamil, and Javanese, the languages at the heart of her study.<br>

Abstract: Since the first part of
      Gatsbyis so direct and so immediate, closely simulating a selected memory of our own, we confront the latter part of the novel with great emotion. This confrontation, one could argue, is really an encounter with our own textual hyper-memory—the idealized memory of the events of the first part of the book. The dream, not only Gatsby's but our own as well, recedes further and further away from us until it freezes into the effects of nostalgia—the reflective and distanced melancholia of the last chapter. As Gautam Kundu has recognized, the world in the first part is “made gorgeous by the magic touch of a romantic imagination that nevertheless moves inexorably toward eventual disintegration and dissolution” (34). The following two sections of this essay will explore this progression in a more detailed way.<br>

Abstract: We do not have answers to the overwhelming questions that the washed-up remains will raise, nor are the questions revealed to the readers. They are left to the imagination, which at this stage has probably already been shocked into pity and fear. Being overwhelmed by questions about life implies experiencing an Aristotelian catharsis after which their lives could hardly return to what they had always been. But it would be a testimony to the humanity of the bystanders if they are overwhelmed by what they will see, because the remains are not part of the “river's creatures”; human bones are not supposed to be washed up by the rivers. This human wreckage could only have been the product of atrocities, and the tide of the river bears witness to them. The history of Liberia is rife with instances of atrocities against innocent people. We recall the British- and American-sponsored colonization of the nineteenth century as well as the brutal regimes and wars of Samuel Doe and Charles Taylor. The Mesurado, the Loffa, and other rivers must have born witness to those crimes. All the victims we can imagine come together in the person of “a lost sister” washed up by the rivers and who stands at the bank “waving at those / who in refusing to die, simply refuse to die.” The redundancy in the phrase is designed to underscore the stubbornness of the dead. The dead refuse to die. They are the ones who literally set the rivers moving; with the help of the rivers, they make their way to the feet of the living. The rivers are their vehicles. By being washed up into the memory of the living, they become one with the survivors—those who, in their own way, also refused to die.<br>

Article Title: Critical Theory<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life.

No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Abstract: In that year three states did not allow women to serve on juries, and the idea of women CEOs of large corporations seemed absurd in the popular imagination. In that imagination the proper place for them was in the home as wives and mothers, hospitals as nurses, primary and secondary schools as teachers, or libraries. The minimum wage increased by fifteen cents to $1.15 an hour. Algeria, Kenya, Angola, and many other countries were colonies, although major anticolonial movements took place around the world as Western colonial power crumbled. In May of that year the Freedom Rides and the extreme violence that went with them took place in the deep South and worked a largely unexpected revolution for interstate public transportation and for the standing and influence of the civil rights movement. Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Homes entered the University of Georgia under heavy guard and brought the beginning of the end to segregation in that university. “Acid rain” first became a recognized concept in this country in 1961.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Approaching Taylor's discourse from a hyperbolic perspective, it becomes evident that, to an extreme degree, the paradoxical maneuvering of his hyperbolic imagination both relies on and is in excess, which is a necessity if his project is to provide effective insight that pertains to his extraordinary subject matter. Taylor is sometimes accused of opaque and nonsensical writing, namely,
      cacozelia, but when viewed from a hyperbolic perspective, his project reveals a skilled hyperbolist responding to an exorbitant exigence that calls for and justifies the extensive use of ambiguity, excess, and exaggeration.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur identifies three ways in which the mediating function of mimesis
      2operates in the configuration of narratives. First, configuration mediates between the individual event and the story as a whole by assigning an event a place of significance in the unfolding of a plot. Let us take, for instance, a book from the aforementioned Americans All series. Lillie Patterson's 1970Martin Luther King, Jr.: Man of Peace, which was awarded the first Coretta Scott King Book Award for African American children's literature, begins with an anecdote from King's childhood. This story narrates King's supposed first encounter with the “wall” of racism. When he enters school, his white friends are no longer allowed to play with him. He persists in seeking their company but is rebuffed: “Finally, their mother tried to tell Martin why. ‘You see, you are colored and they are white’” (Patterson 1970, 10). Unsatisfied, Martin goes to his own mother, who explains the history of slavery and its effects on their lives. She concludes by reminding her son that despite this past, “You are as good as anyone” (Patterson 1970, 10–12). As the opening scene, this vignette both introduces King as a child (creating an identificatory link with readers) and frames the remaining story about a confident man who worked to break down that “wall” of racism. Second, configuration joins and relates disparate aspects of the story, including various agents, actions, motivations, and outcomes. Patterson's text, for example, emphasizes both King's personal ambition and his cooperation with others. Members of his family play a key role, and the appearance of his wife, Coretta Scott, warrants an entire chapter (Patterson 1970, 33–38). Their marriage is represented not as mere love story but as the collaboration between two powerful social agents. The narrator explains that in accepting marriage to King, “Coretta decided to join the young minister and share his dream” (Patterson 1970, 37). Finally, configura~<br>

Abstract: Representing in his review the struggle between the husband and the doctor as a “wrangle between … witches as to the merits of their rival incantations,” Shaw asserts that Day's fatal misstep is to misunderstand the collision between “lay ignorance” and “academic error and prejudice” and to “take sides” (354–55). Shaw's appreciation of staging the conflict between one individual “right in theory and wrong in practice” and another “wrong in theory and right in practice” (354) anticipates verbal skirmishes he would soon create in
      Major BarbaraandThe Doctor's Dilemma. While he praises the grotesque caricature of the doctor (perhaps unintentional on Day's part), Shaw faults the play's ultimate reliance on “an unsound theory of alimentation” and its concurrent “unhappy relapse” into sentimentality in its conclusion (352). Shaw frequently linked diet and excessive romantic imagination. In an 1898 interview withVegetarian, he attributes the outbreak of “fire-eating fiction and Jingo war worship, bloody-minded novels [and] cheered music-hall tableaux” to “the spread of meat-eating,” explicitly gesturing to one of its tragic products, the strife on the Sudan that would eventually catalyze the Boer War.
            If for Shaw vegetarianism is essential to counter narcotic sentimentality in general, it is equally imperative in the struggle for a vital theater, similarly sodden with melodramatic convention. When asked in that interview how “vegetarianism and dramatic criticism blend,” Shaw responded, “meat-fed criticism is the best for the managers. The vegetarian article is best for the public.”8

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53

Abstract: The reviewer of the collection of essay called
         The Cambridge Companion to John Updike, edited by Stacey Olster, confesses that in the middle years of the career of John Updike, he lost interest in the author's novels for the paradoxical reasons that he felt they were either too predictable, seemingly too programmatic or too unpredictable, Updike pumping up a flagging imagination with an assortment ofoutréforms and subjects. But the reviewer rejoices that the predominantly fine essays in theCompanion—by scholars such as D. Quentin Miller, Sanford Pinsker, Edward Vargo, Donald J. Greiner, and John N. Duvall—renewed his interest in the works unread, prompted him to do much catching up, and left him wondering, more ruefully than ever, upon Updike's death in January of 2009 why the novelist had never won a highly deserved Nobel Prize for Literature.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Although Burke had not read Bloch when he formulated his theory of dialectical-rhetorical transcendence, the similarities between the two theorists are remarkable. In particular, both Burke and Bloch emphasize the important role that art and creative letters play in this function of utopia/transcendent rhetoric. For Burke, there are two ways that political and social opposition can be transcended. One, which he says is exemplified by Mannheim, would still think in politically partisan terms. The other is Burke's own reinvention of Plato's dialectical process as an interpretive and generative tool. This way would transcend political partisanship at the level of poetic myth: Myth bursts into the discourse to reveal something out of the ordinary context, and we move beyond the limitations of reason into the potentialities of imagination. He illustrates this process with a reading of Castiglione's
         The Courtier. “By gradations,” writes Burke, “it builds a ladder of courtship dialectically, into a grand design that, in its ultimate stage, would transcend the social mystery, ending Platonically on a mystic, mythic vision of celestial mystery.”
               The handbook is usually studied as a book of manners, but Burke suggests that it had a strong rhetorical influence—perhaps a utopian-rhetorical influence—on the motives of Elizabethan poets and other courtiers of the period. The ultimate aim seems to be merging as closely with the ideal of a perfect courtier as possible and then to become the instructor of a prince (Aristotle and Alexander are cited as examples of this motive).34<br>

Abstract: To what extent, then, is this ironization—this celebration and cerebration of indeterminacy—consistent with a progressive and dynamic mode of Utopian thought? Or might it indeed be supposed that this inscription of a plurality of perspectives is not only consistent with but essential to a mode of Utopianism as an expression of the manifestation of imagination in a moment at which art and theory converge—insofar as such contradictions allow for the fact that, as Walt Whitman suggested, we are “large” and “contain multitudes”
         
               —and inasmuch as (in Karl Popper's words) “irrefutability is not a virtue of theory … but a vice,” in that “every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it”?105
            
               Could the imaginary testing of theory advanced by art offer the beginning of a grounding of theory in historical materiality? Could art build its Utopian foundations precisely by deconstructing them?106<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: For Vidler, dissolution of the Soviet Empire, especially the ritualized razing of the Berlin Wall, amounted to a requiem for Marx and communism, and with them, Utopia—apparent confirmation that there really is
         no alternativeto capitalism, just as neoliberals have long believed. Arguably, this self-serving conviction does not so much bespeak a crisis of Utopia as it is a failure of imagination (which makes envisioning subversion from within all but impossible). While Vidler's association of “the fall of the Berlin Wall” with “the proclaimed death of communism and Marx” may seem reasonable enough, interpreting this as ensuring the end of Utopia disregards thepermanence of desire. In this regard, Zygmunt Bauman observes, “Imagining a better life than the existing one, a life that does not yet exist but one that could and should exist—the eternal source of ‘utopian thinking’ that never runs dry—is as rich, and possibly even richer than at the time of Sir Thomas More.”
