  Abstract: In the preceding chapters I showed that Evangelical religious practice can fit into projects of self-reform among poor Caracas men. But I am yet to address the most difficult question: how can people intentionally adopt a set of religious beliefs and practices in order to confront life problems? The tradition of thought that defines religion and culture in contradistinction to individual rationalistic action can be traced to Durkheim if not earlier. But despite this long-term conceptual trend, the incompatibility of intention and belief has been built on as a presupposition, not established through argument. One exception is the political philosopher<br>

  Abstract: This chapter does not pretend to offer an anthropological theory of remorse, a field that does not exist and that I have no intention of inventing here.¹ Anthropologists′ lack of attention to remorse either suggests an appalling oversight or alerts us to the Western and modernist nature of concepts. Although anthropological references to vengeance, blood feuds, countersorcery, and witch hunts are many, ethnographic descriptions of individual or collective rituals of remorse and reparation are few indeed.<br>

  Abstract: At the conference at which this paper was presented, two participants made a reference to Guillaume Apollinaire without consulting each other beforehand. François Albera first pointed out that, according to the author of “The New Spirit and the Poets,” poets wanted to be able some day “to mechanize poetry as the world has been mechanized.”³ For my part, I projected an excerpt of the poem used here as an epigraph and straightforwardly titled “Before the Cinema.” No intention or planning, no machination should be read into this coincidence, which is first and foremost the result of chance.

  Author(s) O’Donohue John<br>
  Abstract: The essay that best encapsulates the recent thought of Jean-Luc Marion is, in my opinion, “The Saturated Phenomenon” (SP). Here the author gives an account of what he calls the paradox of an “impossible” phenomenon, one that bedazzles the ego through an excess of intuition over intention. Although this idea has generated a good deal of fairly robust criticism,¹ most of the essay’s readers are nevertheless impressed by the way in which Marion uses it not only to enlarge upon the project of

  Author(s) Snellen Paulien<br>
  Abstract: Narrative identity has been a significant area of focus in environmental hermeneutics. This concept of identity builds on Paul Ricoeur’s formulation of the ethical intention of the self: “
                  aiming at the ‘good life’ with and for others, in just institutions.”¹ While Ricoeur’s ethical intention has come up in relation to environmental identity, a full formulation of an environmentally focused version of it has not yet been developed. My intention in this essay is to examine Ricoeur’s ethic as it applies to environmental ethics and philosophy. This application is a fresh way to address several major issues of environmental philosophy, while<br>

  Abstract: It is my intention in this essay to problematize the relationship between economics and ethics. The route I will take is an unconventional one—though not so unconventional if we consider Amartya Sen’s original position on capabilities and his radical revision of the Rawlsian theory of justice. Sen’s thinking is informed by his deep-rooted awareness of alternative possibilities within the heterogeneous—especially given his own argumentative Indian mind—Asian/Indian traditions. My case will be argued through a critique of

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

He had no intention of creating a new religion; rather, he was a reformer of the Judaism of his day. True, his critique went far beyond an intellectual subversion. In fact, Jesus progressively thought of himself as the "Son of Man" inaugurating the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth.<br>

  Abstract: To his critics, Bourdieu’s understanding of human agency (upon which I have relied to loosely structure my explanation of the abandonment) amounts to nothing more than a sophisticated version of social determinism.¹ Although Bourdieu’s intention had been to articulate a way of thinking about why people do what they do that transcended the reductive binaries of domination and resistance, his critics have consistently accused him of proposing a model of agency that condemns human actors to the reproduction of their own histories. And it is easy to see upon what logical grounds such accusations rest. For Bourdieu, after all, social<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the connections between creation and the God of Israel’s consummating and redemptive purposes in the election of a peculiar people. As has been previously argued, Israel knew herself to be contingent, to be a people formed by God’s gracious intention. As a correlate of this understanding, Israel came to apprehend her God as the Creator of all. Reflecting on this “rule of faith” in Israel, Jenson cites 2 Maccabees: “Look at the heavens and the earth … and acknowledge that God made them.”¹ The new thing the New Testament adds, states Jenson, is that creation is for<br>

  Abstract: In a certain sense, it is the intention of the present book to provide a long-form answer to the above questions, posed by Wittgenstein, by showing how, when it comes to human beings, an openly indistinct image is preferable to a falsely sharp one. Accurately recognizing the moments where indistinct pictures become necessary, however, might be the greatest challenge yet posed for philosophical reflection. For indistinct pictures are elusive: in them, the contours of a familiar image may be discerned, yet must not be completely determined. Such an image is pervaded by something that incessantly corrodes it from within, and<br>

  Abstract: The theological situation is not very comfortable: On the one side there are those who think that a non-hermeneutic theology consists only of a contradiction. For them, theology is necessarily hermeneutic.² On the other side, there are those who think that a theology turning toward hermeneutics is the end of the theology. Hence, an alliance between hermeneutics and theology should be strictly avoided.³ It is not difficult to find concrete examples of both parties. One need only elucidate which theological intention is traditionally combined with the attribute that is at stake here. Hermeneutics is the ‘theory’ of understanding; to speak<br>

  Book Title: Jesus and the Cross-Necessity, Meaning, and Atonement<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Laughlin Peter<br>
  Abstract: According to the Nicene Creed, Christ died for us and for our salvation. But while all Christians agree that Christ’s death and resurrection has saving significance, there is little unanimity in how and why that is the case. In fact, Christian history is littered with accounts of the redemptive value of Christ’s death, and new models and motifs are constantly being proposed, many of which now stand in stark contrast to earlier thought. How then should contemporary articulations of the importance of the death of Christ be judged? At the heart of this book is the contention that Christian reflection on the atonement is faithful inasmuch as it incorporates the intention that Jesus himself had for his death. In a wide-reaching study, the author draws from both classical scholarship and recent work on the historical Jesus to argue that not only did Jesus imbue his death with redemptive meaning but that such meaning should impact expressions of the saving significance of the cross.<br>

Easy enough perhaps to state, a rather more difficult task in practice. Indeed, the endeavor threatens to become all-consuming; John Meier’s four-volume work is ample evidence of the<br>

Et, pour le concevoir et le mettre en oeuvre, il faut la collaboration, l’accord ou au moins l’assentiment tacite de toutes les personnes qui, de près ou de loin, vont être affectées, concernées, touchées, intéressées par ce projet (les parties prenantes). La communication, telle qu’on l’entend ici, c’est l’art de connaître d’abord les perceptions, les attitudes et les comportements de toutes ces personnes pour ensuite les influencer, au moyen d’outils de diffusion de l’information.

  Abstract: Pour Goffman (1973), la présentation de soi se fait à travers des interactions et des négociations avec autrui et constitue une composante tangible et intentionnelle de l’identité. L’acteur cherche à projeter une impression qu’il gère grâce à un comportement et des actions répétées et cohérentes avec son intention et les attentes des tiers dans une relation réflexive qui relève de l’
                  imposition de statut(Strauss, 1992). Dans un contexte d’interactions physiques, l’acteur peut s’appuyer sur ce que Marcel Mauss (1936) ou encore André Leroi-Gourhan (1991) ont pu qualifier detechniques du corps. La présentation de soi devient donc une manipulation de<br>

  Abstract: God has died, at least in science and philosophy. He is agonizing in religious study, perhaps even in some divinity schools. Atheism and a careful sequestration of God from current business are the two main forms in which academia deals with the long history of religion, which, notwithstanding academic reservations, goes on. For scholarship, faith, God, and religion have become curiosa. The theoretical intention has separated itself from religious commitments; it abhors edifying language and has forgotten or rejected the long history of its association with contemplation.

They are simplex because, in a very global and immediate way, they enable the brain to grasp a reality, an emotion, a thought, or a complex social relationship. Gesture is a fundamental mark of culture and art, which are always simplex expressions. Gesture is essential to them. Drawing, painting, music, mime, acting, sculpture, and dance are always expressed in gestures. For this reason, we must not be content with a physiology (or a philosophy) of action. We<br>

To this end, Zhu outlined a core group of reading skills: “playing with the savor of the text” (

                  The Politics of Authenticity,“is bound up with a radical rejection of things as they are . . . the desire for authenticity has emerged in modern society as one of the most politically explosive of human impulses.”¹ Even those with less radical agendas, like Sigmund Freud, have been seen as sharing the same desire. According to Lionel Trilling in his classic studySincerity and Authenticity,Freud’s insistence on the tragic dimension of the human condition “had the intention of<br>

My intention in this chapter, therefore, cannnot be to provide a comprehensive review of this vast and subtle body of work. Rather, I want tentatively to explicate one aspect of his vision, the idea of

Is there a sense in which the objects literary critics study are characterized by an element of contingency? And, if such is the case, are they indeed “objects” that could be constituted within a rigorous theoretical program? Or is contingency one of those points where the enterprise of literary criticism touches on its limits, where it takes shape, precisely, as a reflection on the limits of its own epistemological intention?

There is a strange doubleness to it, a way in which it is both accurate and misleading. On the one hand Bishop is dedicated to a concentration so intense that it precludes conscious intention, and each individual act of observation is indeed perfectly useless in and of itself.

  Abstract: Our intention now is to provide a concise and symbolic (graphical) description of the universe as a whole in order to explicate an epistemological meaning of such a description, in particular its dependence upon some irreducible beliefs that make this description possible. To do this we need to give a brief overview of the major methodological presumption in cosmology, namely the cosmological principle.¹ Since we cannot empirically verify the statistics of distribution of matter from other locations in space we have to speculate on the overall distribution of matter in the universe, appealing to philosophical and hence physically untestable assumptions.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter aims to address the ways in which the transition from liberation theory to postcolonial theory entails a historical intellectual encounter with poststructuralism, one that may be termed ‘the poststructuralist turn’. However, in broaching this question, the intention is not to propose that postcolonial theory is determined by its poststructuralist influences in a unilateral manner. That this constitutes a particular area of contention becomes apparent in a context where seminal postcolonial theorists attract attention in the light of their being highly influenced by European theory.

  Abstract: Within much contemporary analytic philosophy of mind desires are conceived of primarily as the inner states which provide us, together with beliefs, with reasons for forming intentions and consequently acting. When linked with beliefs, such desires then cause us to act in appropriate ways. Desires therefore have a role both in providing premises for practical reasoning and a causal, functional role in terms of the agent’s behaviour. Weaving these two roles together has been one of the challenges of contemporary materialism.

  Abstract: In 1980, Habermas enjoyed the distinction of being the first recipient of the Adorno Prize. On the anniversary of Adorno’s birthday, he delivered his acceptance speech in St. Paul’s Church in Frankfurt: “Modernity—an Unfinished Project.” This speech vigorously attacked an array of heterogeneous positions that, in the speaker’s estimation, all had abandoned the emancipatory ideas of modernity. Habermas’s name for these projects as a whole was “postmodern.” In pronouncing this judgment, Habermas took himself to be following a fundamental intention of Adorno himself, who had “unreservedly . . . subscribe[d] to the spirit of modernity” (“Modernity,” 38).

  Abstract: When I arrived in my hometown of Bangalore, on a warm February night in 1998, my intention was to study the economic forces of globalization and their impact on Indian religion, particularly temple Hinduism. Globalization was at that time seen by theorists as the dominance of the culture of the West (Euro-America) upon the rest of the world (Appadurai 1996; Berger 1997), the “center upon the periphery” (Hannerz 1990:i–x) as cultural flows were thought to move from the hegemonic West to the peripheral rest of the world. India had tentatively opened its economy to global market forces in 1989,<br>

  Book Title: The Total Work of Art in European Modernism-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Roberts David<br>
  Abstract: In this groundbreaking book, David Roberts sets out to demonstrate the centrality of the total work of art to European modernism since the French Revolution. The total work of art is usually understood as the intention to reunite the arts into the one integrated whole, but it is also tied from the beginning to the desire to recover and renew the public function of art. The synthesis of the arts in the service of social and cultural regeneration was a particularly German dream, which made Wagner and Nietzsche the other center of aesthetic modernism alongside Baudelaire and Mallarmé.<br>

Abstract: 3.
               A discourse,which is difficult to read. According to Paul Ricoeur:
                        Although written, this discourse does not have the same modalities as writing, such as a certain fluidity insofar as it is detachable from its conditions of production and the inclusion of an invisible and unknown reader; in this case, this text is intended for me, it speaks to me. Neither does it have the modalities of a conversation. In a spoken discourse “the subjective intention of the speaking subject and the meaning of the discourse overlap each other in such way that it is the same thing to understand what the speaker means and what his discourse means.… It is almost the same thing to ask ‘what do you mean?’ and ‘What does that mean?’”Dialogue is an exchange of questions and answers; there is no exchange of this sort between the writer and the reader. The writer does not respond to the reader. Rather, the book divides the act of writing and the act of reading into two sides, between which there is no communication. The reader is absent from the act of writing; the writer is absent from the act of reading. The text thus produces a double eclipse of the reader and the writer. It thereby replaces the relation of dialogue, which directly connects the voice of one to the hearing of the other.
                     34
                        35But, in the case of Hawking, this equivalency is ruptured. The discourse does not come from the mouth of its author; hisIis in front of him—on the screen—and the markers of turn taking are absent. Moreover, what this writing does fix is not the said of speaking but the event of speaking.36Similarly, this discourse fails to show the modalities of interaction by, for example, email, for the author is present—juxtaposed to his text—and at my side. I therefore have to read a text without having the punctuation of the author’s voice, yet with the silent author beside me.<br>

Abstract: The second, more focused collection of essays, written by Chartier, Alain Boureau, and Cécile Dauphin, demonstrates well the complexity of the field as it is generally practiced in France. A small portion of a much larger collection of work, which appeared originally in French in 1991, this book mines the historical possibilities of one source in particular: letter‐writing manuals. These introductions to literate culture are examined in depth, from the first instances in the late eleventh century (studied by Boureau), through their appropriation by the publishers of the
      bibliothèque bleuein the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (examined by Chartier), to the modern how‐to guides for the socially inexperienced and insecure lower middle classes in the nineteenth century (surveyed by Dauphin). The implications extend far beyond the history of reading, but they center on the obvious disjunction between, on the one hand, the intention and content of the texts, often of ecclesiastical, courtly, and aristocratic origin, and, on the other, the multiple interests and uses of their consumers, the recently literate, urban, middle classes seeking some sense of the cultural norms among the social elite. Revealed throughout the essays is more than the tension between text and reading; it is also the tension between “strategies of domination, whether physical or symbolic, and the inventiveness of appropriation that governs the practices of everyday life” (p. 3).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: jr.2005.85.issue-4<br>
Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: Jesus’s love of neighbor is likewise rooted in obedience to God. Obedience is the “referent,” while love is the “content,” but Frei’s point is precisely to emphasize the referent—the “who”—over the “what” of the text. To treat love of one’s fellow humanity as salvific in itself is, for Frei, to reduce or efface the singularity of Jesus’s enacted intention: he is loving toward his neighbors, “enacting the good of men on their behalf,”
         46out of his obedience to God. By highlighting that it is God’s intention that Jesus act on others’ behalf, Jesus’s uniqueness comes to the fore; this is not simply a love for others that can become the “pattern of exchange” so prevalent in literary representations of Christ. Thus, again, the narrative conjunctions between Jesus’s identity, obedience, love, and circumstance, together form the unique unity of the narrative and thereby envisage a singular, full humanity irreducible to other forms or representations. The narrative is itself typological, while also enabling further typological connections between scriptural passages. It thus resembles Midrash while still remaining distinct, in the “connected narrative sequences” that Christian readers are called to discern.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: In a first reading of the book, I was critical of this emphasis on moral motivations, since it seemed to be overburdened by a psychological approach. But, on a second reading, I had to refrain from my critique. Ricoeur makes the point that he has no intention to “take the place of a resolution for the perplexities raised by the very concept of a struggle, still less of a resolution of the conflicts” (218). In other words, Ricoeur is proposing a well‐needed complement to the institutional design trend that has invaded contemporary political philosophy. Contrary to many, he stands before the most perplexing issue of recognition with eyes wide open: indeed, demands of recognition may never end and take the form of an “unhappy consciousness” (218). One can try to resolve this potential inflation of claims by sorting out political and substantive issues. But a solution that takes only this path could create vast areas of frustration that canny elites have learned to fuel, or come to neglect recognition claims on the grounds that they hide a Pandora's box waiting to be opened. I suspect that this neglect mechanism is one of the reasons why so many legitimate recognition claims still languish in limbo as we speak. The course taken by Ricoeur may be difficult to square with the mainstream approach in contemporary political philosophy—political liberalism, to name it—but it nonetheless deserves careful attention.<br>

Abstract: There is an enormous amount of territory we could cover here, but it may be most fruitful to use our limited space considering a matter that has been the focus of attention for many decades—intellectual freedom. Any discussion of intellectual freedom in our profession should begin with the Library Bill of Rights. A brief history of the document appears in the
         Intellectual Freedom Manual[20], and a much more complete background has been provided by Louise Robbins [21]. The first iteration was approved by the ALA Council in 1939. The intention of the LBR is to be normative and regulative, although it does not carry the power of law. It is also intended, as theIntellectual Freedom Manualindicates, to be unambiguous, although it is acknowledged in theManualthat questions do arise. The LBR does raise some questions regarding practical action.<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters.

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Abstract: Coleridge was deeply influenced by Kant’s approach to Christianity as a fundamentally moral rather than theoretical entity. Yet, equally, Coleridge reacted against much in Kant’s theology.
         31Chief among his objections in this context is the way that Kant makes God little more than a reflex of the moral law. InReligion within the Limits of Reason Alone, Kant had argued that “the doctrine of virtue … subsists of itself (even without the concept of God)” and that “when reverence for God is put first, with virtue therefore subordinated to it, this object … becomes anidol.”32In his desire to assert this priority and to disassociate religion from cultic observance and ceremony, Kant hollowed out much of religious practice. Included in his purification of religious concepts is prayer, which figures a valid moral intention (the so‐called pure spirit of prayer) but is improper in purporting to address God: “In the heart‐felt wish which is the spirit of prayer, man seeks but to work upon himself. … A prayer can be offered with perfect sincerity even though the man praying does not presume to be able to affirm that the existence of God is wholly certain. … Asan address, he supposes this Supreme Being to be present in person … hence such complete sincerity cannot be found in the latter.”33At best, prayer can function as a propaedeutic, quickening our desire to fulfill the moral law, with the aim that “the letter of it … [will] finally fall away.”34At worst, it appears as the solitary indulgence in a fiction, as when Kant imagines a praying man “whom some one else takes unawares. … Everyone will … without my saying so, expect a man thus surprised to fall into confusion or embarrassment … because a man caught talking aloud to himself is suspected of having a slight attack of madness.”35Prayer is thus relegated to an improper margin, both philosophically and indeed textually, existing within a supplementary “General Observation” covering prayer, churchgoing, baptism, and ~<br>

Abstract: In sum, implicit in this oath to the death are all the features described above under “Ritual Performances and Liturgical Orders.” The oath relies for compulsion on oath‐making paradigms from the times of the nascent Islamic community and imposes a hallowed duty to respect oaths onto the ritual actors. The composer of these instructions would have known that oath making is strongly conventionalized in the Islamic tradition and would have relied on the convention’s persuasive sanctity to coax the ritual actor to see himself as bound to the oath. Within the scheme of liturgical orders, the oath’s purifying rites (shaving, showering, etc.) might be seen as ritualized microadjustments that help to seal a sacred commitment. Such microadjustments also propel ritual communication to a very high register, which is one measure of its irrevocability. As noted above, just swearing an oath is a metaperformative ritual that compels recognition of the convention it enacts, exactly while it instantiates it. It thus is final, regardless of any internal infelicities on the part of the oath swearer. The feared infelicities that this oath needed to overcome were, doubtlessly, a victory of self‐love over the intention to die and, more important, moral uncertainty in the face of well‐known Islamic prohibitions on suicide.<br>

Author(s): Pranger Burcht<br>
Abstract: If we wish to express the principle of temporality in
         Ulyssesin terms of a formal concept, we could say with Augustine: within the continuous flux of unarticulated consciousness, everything is only to the extent that it is present; the past aspraesens de praeteritis[the present of the past], the present aspraesens de praesentibus[the present of the present], the future aspraesens de futuris[the present of the future]. All [manifestations of] time [alle Zeiten] are subjected to the movement, never to come to rest, of the actual flux of consciousness and are to flow into each other uninterruptedly: the past without any distance, modified and often also deformed, as a mere mirror; the present in a state of absolute contingency, a-causal and without any specificity (without any reference to a hierarchy of meanings), as mere perception; the future entirely as empty projection, in the mode of expectation, of mere intention or of passive desire, but never in the guise of a causal act of the will that would create a future for itself.

Abstract: A number of critics have wanted the film to be making arguments, sending messages, transmitting statements about the human condition. Thus Matthew Anderson sees the film as “present[ing] an argument” (Anderson,
            “Adaptation,”¶41); Zacharek claims that it “doesn't offer us a real story, just a bloated thesis,” the thesis being “that human beings must adapt in order to grow” (“A”); for Gregory Ganssle, quite the reverse, “the deeper message of the film is that there are limits to human adaptability” (Ganssle, “Consciousness, Memory, and Identity,” p. 115); and for Lucas Hildebrand, the line “you are what you love, not what loves you” is to be taken entirely seriously as a lesson Kaufman wishes us to learn; see Lucas Hildebrand, “Review,”Film Quarterly58 (Fall 2004): 41. In interview after interview, however, Kaufman has repeatedly stressed his intention to avoid didacticism. “The movie is … not taking you through and teaching you something, you know, it's to have interactions with” (Kaufman, interview with George Stroumboulopoulos,The Hour, 12 Oct. 2009,www.cbc.ca/thehour/videos.html?id=906970410). Or again: “if I were working to make any conscious point it would become banal” (Michael Sragow, “Being Charlie Kaufman,”Salon.com, 11 Nov. 1999, archive.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/11/11/kaufman/). Or yet again: “my goal when I do something is to have a conversation with the audience rather than to lecture them” (Kaufman, “Interview with Charlie Kaufman,” interview with Peter Sciretta,Slashfilm, 24 Oct. 2008,www.slashfilm.com/2008/10/24/interview-with-charlie-kaufman). (My thanks to Eric Messinger for these references.) The fact that Zacharek and Ganssle reach opposite conclusions, both based on textual evidence, is I think a strong indication that Kaufman, and not Zacharek, is to be believed.<br>

Abstract: In these instrumentalist eucharistic hermeneutics, then, letter and spirit are not exactly equivalent to vehicle and tenor: the letter does not just signify the spirit in a purely referential sense; rather, if used with the proper intention, the letter enables the spirit to enter the soul as a sacred gift to the believer. Thus in his commentary on Corinthians Calvin argues, “These words, L
      etterand Spirit, pertain nothing to exposition [i.e., typological allegory], but to force and fruit.”14Unlike the signs of magic, which supposedly produce the outward embodiment of spirits, the Eucharist functions asa vehicle for an idea that works regeneratively in the inward person, if it is interpreted, or used, with a felicitous spiritual intention. This theory of efficacious allegorical hermeneutics, while sustaining an Aristotelian conception of instrumentality, radically devalues the materiality of the sign, giving it only contingent force. And it is this commitment to material contingency that motivates the reformers' identification of conjurers with Catholic priests who attempt to make God present in bread by pronouncing what Reginald Scot calls Latin “babbles.”15Indeed, the prestidigitator's phrase “hocus pocus” is based on “hoc est enim corpus meum,” finding its genealogical root in the Catholic Mass or, more precisely, in the Protestant argument that Catholic priests do the work of the devil in claiming that their articulations have the performative efficacy to invoke the presence of God.16<br>

Abstract: Finally, it remains unclear how the explicit commitment that I compared to
      prohairesisrelates to the nonreflective level at which commitment still operates in any particular direction of action, even in “letting oneself go in a flight of passion” (64). As I suggested, it seems that the “commitment” necessarily found in spontaneous or unreflective action or omission is no more than the weak endorsement of some reason implicit in any intention, including those of wantons and unwilling addicts. Arguably then, authenticity in actions involving no explicit practical reflection would depend on their being guided by the deeper kind of commitment formed by explicit avowals, in which the more generic type of commitment is made “one’s own” in the deeper sense.<br>

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Therefore, again, Bonhoeffer is trying to think from the incarnation to the world rather than positivistically from grace to the church.
            
                  When he speaks of the “appropriation of the world come of age through Jesus Christ,”131
               
                  both his Christocentrism and his anthropology are characteristically holistic and all-embracing. He is concerned with the significance of the “life, sayings, deeds, sufferings, and death of Jesus”132
               
                  for the entirety of human life in all its manifestations. One may ask, Where in all this is the resurrection? Bonhoeffer often acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the “living Lord”133
               
                  and quite clearly, faith in the resurrection underlies his entire theological reflection. However, as we have seen, his nonreligious interpretation owes much more to the truth of the incarnation. Throughout his life Bonhoeffer meditated on how the reality of God enters the world through the incarnation found in Jesus Christ and how through this act we can discover the divine intention regarding our own life as well as that of the church. His understanding of this-worldliness is impregnated with the Chalcedonian doctrine of the two natures in Jesus: “Just as the reality of God has entered the reality of the world in Christ, what is Christian cannot be had otherwise than in what is worldly, the ‘supernatural’ only in the natural, the holy only in the profane, the revelational only in the rational.”134
               
                  It can be said that the nonreligious interpretation is a “life-Christological interpretation relating Christian faith and life come of age to one another”135
               
                  that aims at inventing the new language capable of grasping the ultimate meaning that Christ’s incarnation bears for this-worldliness.136<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 255. In fact, as Craig reports, in the case of one of such structures—dining room/kitchen building—the client's intent—eventually abandoned—was to have it designed by the contractor's in-house draftspeople. This intention was due to Maybeck's overall tendency to excessive structural design of Principia buildings (ibid., 226–28).<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>
Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

de l'Ane-pape, il provient d'une gravure de Wenzel d'Olmutz qui peignait un monstre
échoué sur les rives du Tibre en janvier 1496, avec une intention polémique probable.

Pierre de Vingle utilise le Château Saint-Ange dans la fausse adresse typographique d'un

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: The works of Tiryakian, Bruyn and Douglas are examined as representative of "phenomenological sociology." Radical problems are discovered in their use of key concepts in phenomenology: intention, reduction, phenomenon and essence. These problems are shown to arise out of a failure to grasp the nature of the phenomenological enterprise and its relationship to sociology. Turning back to the original formulation of this relationship by Husserl, we discover problems of transcendental intersubjectivity, of type and essence, and of objectivism. We then point out the existence of sociologies which do not share the shortcomings of what is called phenomenological sociology, yet which make use of the perspective and approach of phenomenology. We then focus on one of these sociologies, ethnomethodology in its relation to phenomenology. We find parallels in their methodology and domains of inquiry, and divergency in their approaches to intersubjectivity.<br>

Abstract: The Subject of this essay, as well as the intention behind it, is to examine the problems connected with the relationship between sociology and the theme of the person. The paper's position is that this theme has a substantial (and not only formal) centrality within a sociological analysis, which is intended to be critical, in the sense used by Theodor Adorno of this term, and is, therefore, naturally, problematic. This discourse implies that the analysis cannot be limited only to codes and factual dynamics (numbering, classify, aggregating-disaggregating) which reduce the sociological discourse to mere sociography.<br>

Abstract: The theoretical premise of this essay is that metaphors are not simply decorative figures of speech; they have instead played a decisive role in the formation of scientific theory. My specific intention is to show how the metaphors of the "machine", the "body" and the "invisible hand", in diverse ways, provided models with which to represent a social and economic order which was the unintended outcome of human actions. Moreover, reciprocal comparison reveals the limitations on their use, and the reasons why the "invisible hand" was more successful than the other two metaphors in conveying the concept of the competitive market.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i23917944<br>
Date: 3 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Ward Graham<br>
Abstract: Having defined how 'secular' is to be understood in this context, this essay explores two sets of observations. The first concerns the relationship between religion and literature as cultural products of a specific cultural imaginary. Both are fundamentally associated with narrative, which, as even contemporary neuroscience demonstrates, continually attempts to make sense of the world. Both are narratives in which there is a reflection upon, and a performance of, creativity. Since the cultural imaginary has been shaped historically by the religious, then all reflections upon creating are coloured by the sacred. The second set of observations issues from the first and concerns the relationship between authorial standpoint and literary creation. The essay examines authorial intention, the nature of language and the operation of the imagination as each relates to the cultural imaginary and the act of 'making believe'. The two sets of observations and their examination demonstrate the ways in which literature continually resists secularity.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Abstract: Currently, epistemological debates on the formation of concepts in the field of history are close to nonexistent. For that reason alone, this book written by philosopher of history Doris Gerber - with which she earned her habilitation degree at the University of Tübingen - is a welcome addition to the literature in the field. In this work, Gerber addresses the metaphysical question of what "history" really is. In this study, she considers approaches typically adopted within the field of history, and questions whether the intention to act is essential in writing history, or whether it is even required in the first place. The findings of the four reviewers that follow are diverse in their opinion of this provocative study.<br>

Article Title: French utopian socialists as the first pioneers in development<br>
Publisher: OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS<br>
Issue: i24232498<br>
Date: 7 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Frobert Ludovic<br>
Abstract: It is the purpose of this paper to present a reassessment of the works of the first nineteenth century French Utopian Socialists. It is well known that their contributions have been highly criticised, from both the economic and social point of view and the political or ethical one. Recent commentators, mostly historians and philosophers, have, however, underlined the realistic ambition and the reformist spirit of those approaches. This paper aims to develop this perspective. Indeed, it is my intention to defend the idea that the realism of utopia can be even better characterised by economists: the analyses of Leroux, Enfantin, Chevalier, Buchez or Considérant can be interpreted in terms of development. We study more specifically the initial flowering between 1830 and 1835 of the writings of the Saint-Simonians (Enfantin, Chevalier, Pereire), the works of the dissidents (Buchez, Leroux) and those of the main supporters of Fourier (Considerant, Transon, Lechevalier). We will conduct our survey proceeding from the notion of 'vision' proposed recently by Robert Heilbroner. We then examine whether these socialist pioneers really worked in order to elaborate a 'vision' in terms of 'development'.<br>

Abstract: « À travers le langage démonologique, dit Ricœur, quelque chose passe, que nous n'au-
rions peut-être pas remarqué sans cela; l'institution** devient le siège d'une dialectique
interne; l'ordre, ce n'est pas une chose tranquille et de tout repos; l'ordre vibre; l'"ordre" est
une "puissance"; la dimension mythique de la puissance rend inquiétante la dimension ration-
nelle de l'ordre; à travers la prétendue explication par les démons, l'État apparaît comme une
réalité instable, dangereuse : pas simplement instituée mais destituée restituée, à la fois dépas-
sée et retenue; cela la démonologie le montre mythiquement, en ayant l'air de l'expliquer. Il faut
donc garder l'esprit, c'est-à-dire l'intention descriptive du mythe, au prix de sa lettre, c'est-à-
dire de sa prétention explicative » (Paul Ricœur, Histoire et vérité, Paris, Le Seuil, 1964, p. 252).<br>

Abstract: Ces réserves sont ponctuelles, en voici quelques exemples. Comme tout binôme, et il n'est pas
le seul dans le livre, le terme de contre-mémoire risque de produire l'impression d'opposition
mécanique ce qui n'est sûrement pas l'intention de l'auteure. Sur un autre registre, malgré tout
mon respect pour l'héritage intellectuel de Pierre Bourdieu, je ne suis pas convaincu par les efforts
de Christine Chivallon d'appliquer son appareil conceptuel à l'analyse du travail de la mémoire.
Puisque son érudition est très impressionnante, l'absence des travaux de Nathan Wachtel surprend
d'autant plus. L'Invention du quotidien de Michel de Certeau est citée, mais je n'ai trouvé aucune
mention de son concept opératoire de « propre », à mon avis très pertinent pour la démarche de
l'auteure. J'estime également que le concept de « lieu de mémoire » de Pierre Nora est trop rapidement
jugé inopérant pour sa recherche.<br>

Abstract: For Dooyeweerd's Western oriented, sometimes even nationalistically tinted and yet, in
its intention, normative view of culture, see A New Critique, vol. 2, pp. 266-68, etc. In his
Roots in particular, the Occident' is very central (ch. 1, §§ 3,17-25), as the following passage
illustrates: Ά truly scriptural view of history... knows that the great antithesis between the
ground motive of the divine revelation of the Word and the ground motive of the apostate
spirit operates [in history] in the power struggle for the future of western civilization' (p.
108). Yes, Dooyeweerd at one point even calls the Dutch national character, in view of its
calvinistic bent, its humaneness, its sober life-style, and the like, a 'normative type' of histor-
ical disclosure and differentiation (p. 82). See also the striking analysis by C. T. Mclntire in
'Dooyeweerd's Philosophy of History', especially pp. 104-5, together with the nuanced criti-
cism of S. Griffioen in 'De betekenis van Dooyeweerd's ontwikkelingsidee', pp. 105-7.<br>

Abstract: On a souvent décrit la modernité en la rapportant à l'idée de sécularisation du politique : à la faveur de la « grande séparation » hobbesienne, le pouvoir serait devenu un lieu vide, dissocié de toute attache à la transcendance, privé même de tout contenu substantiel. Cette étude entend rappeler que la philosophie politique contemporaine ne s'est nullement accommodée de ce processus de déthéologisation : au cours des dernières décennies, son propre a bien été, en s'appuyant sur le constat des « déraillements » de la modernité, de vouloir reconstituer une forme de lien entre le politique et le religieux. Cette intention partagée s'est incarnée dans trois grandes architectures de sens. La première tient dans le paradigme du recouvrement : il s'agit ici, tout en adhérant le plus souvent aux institutions démo-libérales, de replacer le droit politique sous dépendance de la norme religieuse. La deuxième position s'agence, quant à elle, autour du paradigme de la substitution : on saisit le politique alors comme un objet d'investissement religieux. La troisième figure relève du paradigme de la délibération : attachée au principe d'indétermination démocratique, à distance donc de toute primauté du spirituel comme de toute religion du politique, elle se construit, quant à elle, autour du dessein d'articuler, dans l'espace de la discussion civique, les convictions séculières et les croyances religieuses. Dans son ordre propre, la philosophie politique confirme l'hypothèse de l'inscription de nos sociétés dans une forme de post-sécularité. Modernity has been often described via the idea of a secularization of the Political: by way of the hobsian "great separation", power would have become an empty space, dissociated from all attachment to transcendence, deprived even of all substantial content. This study whishes to remind that contemporary Political Philosophy hasn't accommodated with this process of de-theologization: along the last decades, what characterized it has been, f~<br>

Abstract: This article discusses the conduct and evaluation of interpretive research in information systems. While the conventions for evaluating information systems case studies conducted according to the natural science model of social science are now widely accepted, this is not the case for interpretive field studies. A set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field research in information systems is proposed, along with their philosophical rationale. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by evaluating three published interpretive field studies drawn from the IS research literature. The intention of the paper is to further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding interpretive research methodology.<br>

Publisher: Society for Historical Archaeology<br>
Issue: i25616488<br>
Date: 1 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): McCarthy John P.<br>
Abstract: Much archaeological scholarship on consumption has approached its subject matter as the means to an end—e.g., as a way of studying socioeconomic status—rather than as a proper object of study in its own right. The "consumer choice" school, and, more recently, advocates of consumer behavior studies, have supported approaches that emphasize quantitative methods, at the same time downplaying the "qualitative" or symbolic aspects of consumption. A considerable body of literature on the symbolic aspects of consumption exists both in historical archaeology and other fields. The intention of this essay is to draw together this recent literature on consumption and combine it into a single approach that emphasizes shopping as the meaningful action at the very heart of consumption. With the emphasis on agency, this approach presents shopping as that crucial moment of transformation where identity, intention, and symbol combine in the decision to purchase, to own, an object.<br>

Fahigkeit zur Unterscheidung von twb wrf haben. In 2 Sam 19,36 sagt der 80jahrige
Barsillai, daB er dieselbe nicht mehr besitze. In den ersten beiden Fallen durfte Un-
mundigkeit, im letzteren Falle das Eingestandnis von Hilfsbediirftigkeit (mit der Barsil-
lai David nicht zur Last fallen wollte), gemeint sein. Jona 4,11 findet sich V yde byn
ymnw lsmlw in einem ahnlichen Sinn (vgl. auch G.J. Botterweck, “ydr", ThWAT III,

ausdriicken? Menschen, die noch nicht oder nicht mehr iiber dft twb wrf verfiigen, sind
in unserer Sprache nicht oder nicht mehr zurechnungsfahig, nicht oder nicht voll ver-
antwortlich. An einen Mangel an Zeugungsfahigkeit ist dabei wohl nicht zu denken.

Abstract: This essay examines the correspondence between Beckett and Duthuit in the light of the unpublished notes that Beckett took in Germany in 1936-37. The underlying issue that Beckett's reflections on the image seems to address is the reorientation of his creative writing and the development of a new aesthetic. There is, when Beckett is confronted to an image, a double movement that can be discerned in the way he beholds the image, of fascination, first, but also of mistrust towards this painting. In stripping paintings of their narrative of figurative intention, Beckett's comments seem to aim at a situation of mankind in the world, apprehended outside of all preoccupations with its causes or as the effect of an absent cause. Cette contribution examine la correspondance entre Beckett et Duthuit et cherche à la mettre en perspective avec les notes inédites que Beckett prend en Allemagne (1936-37). L'enjeu indirect des réflexions de Beckett sur le problème de l'image, c'est la réorientation de son écriture, le développement d'une esthétique nouvelle. Il y a chez Beckett un double mouvement, de fascination, mais aussi de méfiance, face à l'image. En dépouillant ces peintures de leur charge narrative ou figurative, les commentaires de Beckett semblent viser une situation de l'homme, appréhendée en dehors de toute cause ou comme l'effet d'une cause absente.<br>

Abstract: Le concept aristotélicien d'aretè est plus éloquent quand il est traduit par «excel-
lence» que par «vertu». Voir P. HaDOT, op. cit., p. 249: «Le mot grec are té que nous tra-
duisons par Vertu' avait en son origine une tout autre signification que notre mot Vertu.
Ce terme remontait à l'éthique aristocratique de la Grèce archaïque et il ne signifiait pas
du tout une bonne habitude ou un principe qui nous conduit à bien agir, mais plutôt la
noblesse elle-même, l'excellence, la valeur, la distinction. On peut penser que cette idée
d'excellence et de valeur est restée toujours présente dans l'esprit des philosophes. Pour les
Stoïciens, X areté est la valeur absolue, fondée non plus sur la noblesse guerrière mais sur
cette noblesse de l'âme que représente la pureté d'intention». Voir aussi W. Jaeger, Pai-
deia: la formation de l'homme grec. 1. La Grèce archaïque. Le génie d'Athènes, trad. de
l'allemand A. et S. Devyver, Paris 1964, p. 27-41: §«Noblesse et areté», notamment p.
31: «L'équivalent de ce mot areté n'existe pas en français moderne: son acception la plus
ancienne représente un mélange de fierté, de moralité courtoise et de valeur guerrière.
Pourtant, cette idée d'areté est la quintessence même de l'éducation aristocratique dans la
Grèce archaïque».<br>

Abstract: Cet article retrace le parcours singulier d'Arlette Farge. L'historienne y évoque sa propre trajectoire scientifique, parlant des rencontres qui ont joué un rôle déterminant dans l'évolution de ses recherches (Philippe Ariès, Michel Foucault). Elle revient sur ses ouvrages, rappelant l'intention qui a présidé à leur élaboration dans le contexte dans lequel ils ont été préparés et écrits. Enfin, l'entretien est l'occasion pour l'historienne d'évoquer son rapport à la discipline et aux autres sciences sociales, ou encore ses manières de lire les archives et d'écrire pour construire une « histoire de l'infime ». This article recounts the unusual intellectual journey undertaken by Arlette Farge. The historian recalls the scientific path she followed, including a discussion of her encounters with Philippe Ariès and Michel Foucault, both of which played a decisive role in the development of her research. She goes back over her published works, remembering the intentions that motivated them and the context in which they were researched and written. Finally, the interview offers the historian an opportunity to talk about her relationship to the discipline of history itself and to the other social sciences, and how she goes about reading historical records and writing in order to construct a "history of minute details".<br>

Si l’origine métaphorique de ces notions est parfois rappelée, sinon exploitée, par les auteurs qui y ont recours, elle est souvent passée sous silence. Cet article propose de raviver la dimension métaphorique de ces notions, en les complétant de deux autres – mouillage et amarrage – dans une double intention: d’une part, en montrant qu’en les prenant au sérieux, il est possible de leur faire désigner différents types de rapport aux lieux qui exploitent directement les images sous-jacentes; d’autre part, en rappelant que ces images participent d’une poétique du savoir qui distille des effets de vérité dont les motivations sont à rechercher dans les options épistémologiques majeures adoptées.<br>

Abstract: I will investigate in this paper what kind of "Weltanschauung" Freud suggests. Although Freud argues in the lecture XXXV, "The Question of a "Weltanschauung" (1933)," that psychoanalysis is incapable of creating a "Weltanschauung" of its own, I think that he has a certain "Weltanschauung", i.e., the aesthetic worldview, which involves his scientific, psychoanalytic, and artistic principles. Furthermore, I will explicate that Freud's aesthetic worldview is ultimately related to the "Weltanschauungen" of William James and Paul Ricoeur. I will focus particularly on their terms, "sympathetic" and "poetic," which are the crucial elements that constitute the aesthetic "Weltanschauung". Finally, I will briefly present my intention in drawing this aesthetic "Weltanschauung". I will conclude that throughout the aesthetic "Weltanschauung" we may accept that everything is precious, pertinent, and worthy to be viewed as a part and a whole, and as home (Heim).<br>

Abstract: Alexis Kagame in Les cultures et le temps, Paris, Payot/Unesco, 1975,
p. 120. Cela se produit dans d'autres cultures par ailleurs très différentes.
« En Hindoustani moderne... l'adverbe kal veut dire à la fois » hier « et
« demain ». Parson désigne tout aussi bien après-demain qu'avant-hler ;
atar son signifie tout autant il y a trois Jours que dans trois Jours. Seul le
contexte donne le sens » (Hajime Nakamura, Time in Indian and Japanese
thought, in The Voices of Time, op. cit., p. 81) (ma trad. W. G.).
L'auteur relève que dans la pensée indienne le temps, tout comme d'autres
phénomènes, est conçu de manière plutôt statique que dynamique et il cons-
tate aussi le manque d'intérêt des Indiens pour l'histoire, le manque de
conscience historique. Dans des ouvrages comme le Mahavamsa de l'ancienne
Ceylan, les légendes se mêlent aux faits historiques précisément décrits.
mais sans dates, ou bien comme dans Raj atar angini, chronique des dynasties
du Cachemire, les dates sont inadéquates ou un pur produit de l'Imagination
(pp. 81-82).
Le travail souvent cité de Benjamin Lee Whorf sur les Hopis de l'Arizona
révèle également une représentation du temps qui ne manque pas de nous
surprendre. Leur langage ne contient aucun vocabulaire qui se réfère au
temps ou à aucun de ses aspects. Les verbes n'ont pas de temps, toutes les
actions s'expriment au présent. Aucune distinction n'apparaît entre le passé
et le présent. L'idée du futur ne se trouve que dans des expressions subjec-
tives manifestant l'attente, le souhait, l'intention, liées le plus souvent avec
une action qui commence. Cf. An American Indian Model of the Universe, In
Language, Thought and Reality, Cambridge, Mass., mit press, 1956, pp. 57-64.<br>

Date: 12 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Zumbach Steven W.<br>
Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires~<br>

Article Title: A Preface to Ethics: Global Dynamics and the Integrity of Life<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000937<br>
Date: 4 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This essay outlines a new preface for ethics demanded by the massive developments of the global age. It does so in and through the comparative use of "myths" to explicate the lived structure of experience. The essay begins by isolating main features of global dynamics, including proximity, the compression of the world and the expansion of consciousness, and also global, cultural reflexivity. In the second step of the "preface," it is argued that globality itself is a moral space in which peoples must orient their lives. It is a moral space defined by the massive extension of human power in the modern world. In light of the challenge that global dynamics and the extension of human power now pose, the essay then isolates, methodologically, options for developing a global ethics, and advocates a distinctly hermeneutical approach. This approach is practiced in the last section of the "preface" by engaging ethically the biblical "myth" of creation and its reinterpretation in an epitome of Jesus's Torah teaching. The intention is to show how current religious thought can speak to massive challenges in a distinctive way. It is, again, to offer a preface to ethics.<br>

Abstract: Aun cuando el pormenor de este ensayo se centra principalmente en los cambios de acento que experimenta la obra de Karl Mannheim en los años veinte, cuando éste se consagró resueltamente a la sociología, el autor quiere contribuir a explicitar las razones que justifican la plena actualidad de su figura intelectual y de su obra. Sostiene que la obra de Mannheim está vertebrada con inequívoca unidad de intención y procura fijar el sentido preciso de la misma. Mannheim fue un pensador del cambio y del conflicto que consagró toda su energía intelectual a interpretar y a afrontar la crisis de orientación y participación que mina la organización de las sociedades de nuestro tiempo. Concebía la sociología como la ciencia de integración necesaria para orientar la convivencia humana en una situación cultural disgregada y altamente polarizada y compleja. Su visión de la misma apela con claridad a la condición interdependiente e intersubjetiva de la existencia y es congruente con el empeño de quienes, para superar la crisis de la ciencia de la sociedad, tratan de armonizar la sociología equilibrando los excesos estructuralistas con un adecuado tratamiento de la dimensión comunicativa de la vida social. /// Althought this essay focuses mainly on the variations in emphasis suffered by Karl Mannheim's works 1920's, when he devoted himself determinaly to Sociology, it is the author's propose to help highlight the reasons justifying the absolute topicality of both his intellectual dimention and thought. It is defended that Mannheim's works are organized with a clear oneness of intention and an attemp is made to explain its meaning. Mannheim was a thinker of change and conflicit who dedicated his entire intellectual energy to interpreting and facing the crisis of orientation and participation undermining contemporary societies. Sociology was for him considered to be the science of integration, needed for orientation of human coexistence in a desintegrated, complex and highly polariz~<br>

Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Article Title: Classical Otherness: Critical Reflections on the Place of Philology in Gadamer's Hermeneutics<br>
Publisher: Faculdade de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40014488<br>
Date: 12 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Renaud François<br>
Abstract: Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics rests largely on the concept of the classical. According to Gadamer, the classical stands for the continuity and the truth claim of the tradition, as transmitted by the written word. The normative character of the classical is directed against the neutrality and relativism of historicism: understanding does not occur primarily through distancing or methodological reconstruction but through belongingness to, and participation in, the past. The article shows how, given the central importance of dialogue and otherness in Gadamer's theory, the philosopher does not seem to fully do justice to the critical intention of its own dialogical and philological dimensions. On the other hand, it shows also how Gadamer's hermeneutical practice, notably in his rehabilitation of Plato, stresses the learning from otherness more explicitly than does his own theory, thus correcting, as it were, the latter. The article aims, finally, at demonstrating how, by unduly emphasizing the continuity (and sameness) in the encounter between past and present, Gadamer's theory undermines the importance of reconstructing the otherness and specificity of the classical text. /// A hermenêutica filosófica de Gadamer, entendida como uma defesa das humanidades, assenta essencialmente sobre o conceito de clássico. Segundo Gadamer, o clássico representa a continuidade e a pretensão à verdade da tradição tal como nos é transmitida pela palavra escrita. O carácter normativo do clássico em Gadamer constitui assim uma resposta crítica à neutralidade e ao relativismo do historicismo: a compreensão não acontece primariamente graças a um processo de distanciação ou reconstrução metódica, mas sim pelo facto de, desde logo, reconhecermos que temos pertença activa no passado. O presente artigo demonstra como, dada a importância central do diálogo e da alteridade na teoria de Gadamer, ofilósofo acaba por não fazer inteiramente justiça à intenção crítica inerente à dimensão dialógi~<br>

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>
Issue: i40014889<br>
Date: 9 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Abstract: L'article passe en revue certains emplois assumés du terme fiction et écarte la conception ultra-relativiste selon laquelle tout serait fiction puisque la vérité des faits est impossible à établir et que le langage, a fortiori tout récit, sont par nature fictionnels. Envisager par ailleurs l'acception large de la notion de fiction comme quelque chose de construit se révèle peu productif car tout texte, toute oeuvre, même celle qui vise à la neutralité documentaire, peut dès lors être qualifiée de fiction. La recherche de vérité(s) doit demeurer à l'horizon des efforts des scientifiques. À cet égard, il convient de considérer la fiction artistique comme la véritable fiction. Son cadre pragmatique est celui que l'on désigne par les expressions de « feintise ludique » ou de « feintise partagée ». Sur ce plan, la fiction se distingue du faux (du mensonge), de l'erreur (de l'illusion) et de l'hypothèse (de la théorie). Si elle se distingue des discours liés aux intentions scientifiques, la fiction artistique intéresse néanmoins, en tant qu'objet, les anthropologues : imagination artistique et imaginaire collectif entretiennent en effet des relations d'influences réciproques. The ultra-relativististic conception whereby everything is fiction is shunned. It claims that the truth of facts cannot be established and that language and even more so narratives are fictional by nature. A broader acceptation of fiction as something « constructed » turns out to be of little use since any text or writing – even one with the intention of documentary neutrality – falls under the label of fiction. The quest for truth(s) must remain a scientific pursuit. In this respect, « artistic fiction » should be considered to be genuine fiction. Phrases such as « shared » or « playful pretense » refer to its pragmatic framework. Fiction thus stands apart from falsehood (lies), error (illusions) and hypothesis (theories). Though distinct from scientific intentionality, artistic fiction is of intere~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: Mise radicalement en question par l'accusation de l'épître aux Corinthiens : „La sagesse du monde est folie devant Dieu.” (I Cor. 3,19), la raison humaine doit chercher une méthode, qui lui permettra de parvenir à une conscience de soi, capable d'assumer cette accusation. Cette méthode ne peut être que la réflexion, à laquelle les protagonistes de la phénoménologie, aussi bien que ceux de l'analyse reflexive, font appel. Thévenaz entamera une étude approfondie et critique de ces deux méthodes pour en garder ce qui lui semble valable. Ce faisant il parviendra à une position intermédiaire. Husserl, en épistémologue, ignorant toute conscience de soi, même implicite, reconnaît l'inténtionnalité comme structure unique de la raison humaine. Aussi, pour découvrir et expliciter le sujet concret et intentionnellement lié au monde, il ne lui reste que la solution de projeter cette liaison dans le champ transcendantal, qui se déploie sous les yeux d'un spectateur impartial. Ainsi surgit une nouvelle facticité qui reste nécessairement irréfléchie. Thévenaz accepte volontiers les avantages de cette méthode. Non seulement elle permet de dépasser l'opposition idéalisme-réalisme, mais en plus elle échappe au formalisme kantien, en nous livrant le concret comme tel, le vécu, l'être comme rencontre. Cependant, en insistant exclusivement sur l'intentionnalité, elle met en question cette même intentionnalité. Le sujet concret, doublure du moi transcendantal et intentionnel, redevient ce qu'il était avant la réduction, un oeil sans intériorité braqué sur un nouveau spectacle, le champ transcendantal. Le sujet concret n'y apporte aucun apport constitutif. Le concret s'échappe à nouveau et la naïveté de la „natürliche Einstellung” n'est pas vaincue, mais consacrée. Sartre, quoiqu'il admette une conscience (de) soi, résultant d'un acte de néantisation radicale, se heurte à la même difficulté. Le sujet concret échappe à la réflexion à cause du dédoublement inéluctable inhérent à cette réfle~<br>

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to outline Ricoeur's outlook on the basis of ethics and on the main elements to shape the ethical intention. Although this topic is not to the fore in his thought, Ricoeur has often raised the ethical problematic and delivered most valuable insights into it. We explain how he let a subjective, intersubjective and neutral moment precede the relationship between freedom and law. We also inquire into his vision on values and on the impact and meaning of evil for ethics. The ground of ethical existence is the fact that man basically is original affirmation of being which manifests itself in longing and striving. This dynamic facticity which is only discoverable through a reflection upon the works and creations of man, represents the starting-point for an autonomous ethics having a historical character. In this way, Ricoeur - in the main stream of J. Nabert - turns against I. Kant whose duty ethics misjudges the basic dialectic of human action. Besides, this starting-point allows ethics to meet the Christian kerygma in a more meaningful way than duty ethics is in a position to it. For the kerygma sacralizes no ethical interdiction but situates man into a history of salvation and proclaims healing and fulfilment to man's longing. A second and decisive moment in ethical existence is the appearance of the other. When the other enters into my life, he calls me up to foster mine and his freedom als well. The other becomes a centre of obligation to me, and I am called up to promote the well being of all mankind. Ricoeur also points out that the very norm of morality is man both as an individual and communitarian being. Furthermore, as human freedom is always mediated, we should fully take into account the economic, political and cultural reality which is ethically most relevant. The practice of freedom raises the question of values. Ricoeur rejects any voluntaristic and essentialistic view. Values are immanent requirements of freedom in its effort ~<br>

Abstract: In 1758, Mary Jemison was captured by a party of Indians and adopted by two Seneca sisters. She progressively accommodated herself to Indian life, married two Indian warriors and bore them several children. Sixty-five years after her abduction, the woman agreed to tell James E. Seaver the story of her life. My goal is to use Lorrayne Carroll's rhetorical drag as a hermeneutic to analyze authorial impersonation in A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Mary Jemison, to underline the failure of the white male impersonator to marginalize the speaking voice of the narrative and to highlight the capacity of the I object/subject to destabilize canonical readings of the text and to offer a revisionist history of cross-cultural encounters. Thus, it is my intention to present this account as an instrument of defiance of hegemonic cultural models and as an example of how intercultural manifestations negotiate and hybridise fixed paradigms. En 1758, Mary Jemison fue capturada por un grupo de indios y adoptada por dos hermanas Seneca. Poco a poco, Mary se fue adaptando a la vida india y acabó casándose con dos guerreros indios con los que tuvo varios hijos. Sesenta y cinco años después de su secuestro, la mujer accedió a contarle a James E. Seaver la historia de su vida. Mis objetivos son: analizar El relato de la vida de la señora Mary Jemison mediante el concepto de máscara retórica acuñado por Lorrayne Carroll; destacar el fracaso del imitador hombre y blanco para marginalizar la voz narrativa; y subrayar la capacidad del yo objeto/sujeto para desestabilizar lecturas canónicas del texto y ofrecer una historia revisionista de los encuentros interculturales. Es mi intención presentar este relato como un desafío a los modelos culturales hegemónicos y como ejemplo de cómo las manifestaciones interculturales negocian y combinan paradigmas establecidos.<br>

Author(s): Baumgartner Frédérique<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on Gina Pane's performance Escalade non anesthésiée (1971), which consisted of the artist mounting a ladder studded with sharp metallic shards, causing injury to herself in the process. Previous art historians have read Pane's performances through a psychoanalytic lens, emphasizing the place of Lacanian thought in the nascent French feminist movement of the 1970s. This article posits that psychoanalytic accounts of Pane's work have neglected the political context of the work's execution and reception. Pane specifically referenced the Vietnam War when she described her intention with Escalade non anesthésiée. Accordingly, this article links her performance to art sociologique - a term applied to a range of politicized works produced in Paris in the wake of the May 68 events - and thereby to the politics of the Internationale Situationniste. Stressing the importance of the concept of alienation in the discourse of the 1970s and in Pane's writings, this article argues that the masochistic elements of her performance were an attempt to end collective passivity. This collective de-anesthetization was carried out by Pane through the photo-documentation of her performance, in which she staged the image of a non-specific rather than individual body.<br>

Abstract: L'intention de l'auteur du présent article est de montrer que des liens manifestes peuvent s'établir entre la philosophie de F. Gonseth et celle de L. Wittgenstein de même que celles de trois penseurs représentatifs de la philosophie dite analytique: J.L. Austin, W.V. Quine et J. Searle. Il importe en effet de dénoncer certaines mises en opposition fallacieuses et de souligner le bénéfice à tirer d'un dialogue entre le courant de pensée anglo-saxon et celui d'Europe occidentale. En toile de fond, la philosophie du language! On se souviendra à cet égard que F. Gonseth a sans cesse défendu la thèse qu'un jeu de prêté-rendus s'établit en recherches scientifiques comme en recherches philosophiques sur le front de renonciation et sur le front de l'expérimentation. Il en résulte que la mise à l'épreuve de la pertinence du langage ne s'effectue correctement que si l'on prononce un verdict sur le complexe discours-activités. C'est dire l'importance accordée par F. Gonseth à l'insertion non seulement des mots, mais de l'expression discursive en sa globalité dans des contextes précisants.<br>

Author(s): THOUARD Denis<br>
Abstract: Si l'on admet que l'herméneutique part de la reconnaissance d'une intention de signifier donnée déposée dans des signes, force est de considérer que l'entreprise kantienne s'y oppose, aussi bien d'un point de vue systématique que d'un point de vue historique. On critiquera à cette occasion la tentative de tirer du kantisme, en particulier de la troisième Critique, un point de départ pour une herméneutique. L'étude de « l'herméneutique morale » de l'écrit sur la religion replacé dans le contexte de la critique biblique de son époque apporte une confirmation des analyses systématiques et souligne les limites du dispositif kantien. Les reproches adressés par les tenants de « l'école mythique » de Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) à la Religion dans les limites de la simple raison reviennent à distinguer nettement jugement et interprétation : Kant met en oeuvre un jugement, et non une interprétation. If one admits that the starting point of hermeneutics is a recognition of an intention to signify facts left in signs, then one must recognize that the project of Kant is opposed to this starting point, both from a systematic and historical point of view. The temptation to take from the works of Kant, especially the Third Critique, a starting point for hermeneutics will be subject to analysis. A study of « moral hermeneutics » that is drawn from the texts of religion (and which is done within the context of the biblical criticism of their period) confirms the analysis et underlines the limits of the Kantian plan of action. The criticisms of the « l'école mythique » of Göttingen (J. G. Eichhorn, J. G. Rosenmüller, G. L. Bauer) aimed at Religion within the limits of simple reason aid to clearly distinguish between judgement and interpretation. Kant implements a judgment and not an interpretation.<br>

Issue: i40143302<br>

Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: Dans l'« Archéologie », Thucydide met en oeuvre les modalités et les conséquences d'une omniprésence de la polis, en tant que phénomène social total, depuis les commencements, puis tout au long des « temps anciens (τά παλαιά) », et jusqu'au présent (νῦν). La description de ce passé antérieur est tantôt celle de l'état présocial ou de la genèse de l'état social de l'homme, tantôt celle des premiers temps des sociétés grecques, alors tournées vers le « développement » (αύξηθῆναι) et préoccupées de leur « puissance » (δύναμις). L'Archéologie entretient avec le présent une relation de distance et d'interférence. De distance, parce que le recours constant à l'expression τὰπαλαιά pour désigner ce moment marque une intention d'objectivation ; d'interférence, parce que les modèles d'intelligibilité élaborés par Thucydide tout au long de son exposé sont, par leur origine, empruntés au présent. Il montre que les concepts se sont forgés, sedimentes, complexifies au cours de cette forme de préhistoire. L'« Archéologie » décrit à la fois les temps anciens et le présent, le présent dans les temps anciens ; elle recourt à des concepts tirés du présent, mais validés parce qu'ils sont opératoires dans les temps des origines. In the «Archeolog», Thucydides brings into play the modalities and consequences of an omnipresence of the polis, as a total social phenomenon, since the origins, then all along the «former past» (ta palaia), to the present (nun). The description of that former past is sometimes that of a presocial state or of the genesis of man's social condition, sometimes that of the early days of Greek societies then bent on «development» (auxethenai) and concerned by their power (dynamis). The Archeology entertains with the present a relation of distance and interference. One of distance since the permanent resort to the expression ta palaia to designate that moment underscores an objectivying purpose; one of interference, since the patterns of intelligibility worked out ~<br>

Abstract: La question posée par Pilate à Jésus s'éclaire par l'usage de l'adverbe interrogatif en grec profane et biblique, par le contexte de l'entrevue et surtout par les douze autres emplois de pothen dans l'évangile de Jean. Au-delà de l'origine galiléenne de Jésus de Nazareth est suggérée une autre origine, chez « le Père », « celui qui l'a envoyé ». Cette double origine de Jésus rejoint l'intention principale du quatrième évangile. The question that Pilate puts to Jesus become clear with help of the context and still more in the light of twelve other uses of pothen in the Fourth Gospel, all related to Jesus. Over and above his Galilean origin another origin is suggested, from "the Father", "who has sent him". Such an allusion to Jesus' double origin is at the heart of the Gospel of St. John.<br>

Abstract: Lire Certeau dans une intention philosophique n'est légitime qu'à partir de la configuration propre et de la réception historiographique dominante de son œuvre, donc en considérant le contemporain comme contexte et paradigme déterminants. Cela peut consister à prolonger certaines de ses ouvertures «poétiques et politiques», étayées sur «le sens commun», «l'homme ordinaire», et le langage courant. Sa libre exploration formelle et épistémologique du «quotidien» invite à une reconsidération du lien poétique moderne entre l'espace public (l'institution) et l'espace privé (l'étrangeté banale). On y rencontre quelques thématisations radicales pouvant nourrir une réarticulation fondamentale du politique et de la subjectivité, au registre spécifique de la civilité. To read Certeau with philosophical intention is only legitimate on the basis of the unique configuration and the dominant historiographie reception of his work, considering the present-day, that is, as the decisive context and paradigm. That may mean prolonging some of his "poetic and political" overtures, backed up by "common sense", "the ordinary man" and common language. His freely formal and epistemológica! exploration of "the day to day" invites us to reconsider the modern poetic link between public space (the institution) and private space (commonplace oddness). That brings us to some radical thematics capable of nurturing a fundamental reformulation of the political and the subjective, in the specific domain of civility.<br>

Abstract: Reprenant la célèbre distinction de Max Weber entre éthique de conviction (Gesinnnungsethik, littéralement éthique de l'intention ou de la motivation) et éthique de responsabilité (Verantwortungsethik), l'auteur, qui a exercé la charge de Conseiller fédéral à Berne, s'interroge sur ce qui pourrait différencier l'éthique du politicien de l'éthique du citoyen. Après avoir montré, à la suite de Paul Ricoeur, que l'une et l'autre sont confrontées à des questions semblables, même si elles se situent à des niveaux différents, l'article développe le sens large de la responsabilité comme parole, réponse et engagement responsable. Using Max Weber's famous distinction between an ethics of conviction (Gesinnungsethik, literally an ethics of intention or motivation) and an ethics of responsibility (Verantwortungsethik), the author, ex-Federal Councillor in Bern, reflects upon the possible differences between the ethics of the politician and that of the citizen. After showing that, following Paul Ricoeur, both are confronted with similar questions, though situated at different levels, this article develops the larger idea of responsibility as one's word, response and responsible commitment.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de P. Ricœur laisse envisager une articulation spécifique entre la structure métaphysique de l'existence, caractérisée comme réflexion décentrée, et le mode propre selon lequel le religieux fait sens. En son principe, le religieux est coextensif au mouvement même de la réflexion, dont l'herméneutique constitue à la fois la vérité et la méthode: tension temporelle du soi entre son acte propre et les signes qu'il produit (Nabert), au sein du sens qui le précède. Sans jamais combler spéculativement la faille entre le soi et l'absolu, le religieux présente à l'imagination (au sens kantien) le scheme de l'accomplissement de l'existence. The work of P. Ricœur allows one to envisage the possibility of a specific link between the metaphysical nature of existence, depicted as eccentric reflection, and the standart view which gives religion its direction. In its principle, the 'religious' factor is co-extensive with the flow of reflection, whose hermeneutic constitutes not only the truth, but also the method: a temporal tension in the Self as between one's own actions and the effects they produce (J. Nabert), in the context of the intention which precedes them. While never spcculativcly overloading the fissure between the Self and the Absolute, religiosity affords to the imagination (in the sense used by Kant) a pattern for the fulfilment of existence.<br>

Author(s): Macdonald Helen M.<br>
Abstract: Cet article est issu d'une étude ethnographique menée à l'Université de Cape Town. Il explore la dynamique d'une intervention permettant au personnel de l'université de s'engager dans une voie alternative à celle de l'apartheid en Afrique du Sud. Il traite de la politique sociale qui apparut entre l'intervention, ses participants et non-participants imaginaires par rapport à la vision « transformatrice » de l'université. L'intention des interventionnistes a été retravaillée par les participants des principaux symboles qui mettent en forme les motifs de leurs comportements et donnent un sens à leurs expériences. Utilisant le modèle d'Ortner (1973) de reconnaissance et de symboles-clés, je soutiens que la « transformation » et « l'espace sûr » représentent une élaboration symboles, en ce sens qu'ils ont le pouvoir d'action et d'élaboration conceptuelle. Ces symboles d'élaboration fonctionnent en relais avec une sorte de logique qui « cristallise l'engagement » des participants vers l'intervention d'une manière émotionnellement puissante et relativement indifférenciée. Ce faisant, ils font de l'intervention un symbole capable d'exprimer ce que leur expérience signifie pour eux en tant que communauté imaginée par rapport aux autres.<br>

Abstract: Although Jabbeh Wesley has addressed the conflict between the Americo-Liberians and the indigenous populations, it is not her intention to revive old identity-based encounters or conflicts; the major goal in her poetry is to bring to discourse the Liberian people's human condition. She understands that literature involves the experiences of people. “It doesn't exist in isolation of the experiences of a specific group of people” (Beattie-Moss). More specifically, “poetry is an outlet for my grief and a way to immortalize some of the suffering that we've endured, my family, my people, Liberia” (Herring). To immortalize people's suffering in narratives is to bear testimony to people's struggles, to give voice to the voiceless. Her specific intention is to bring about healing by demonstrating that the pain of one is the pain of all.<br>

Abstract: At this juncture I should like to revisit the 1971 article that first involved me in the religious meaning of diasporic religions.
         
               In this article I gave prominence to the meaning of Africa in African American religions. It should be noted that I did not equate religion with theology. As a matter of fact, one of my major aims was to make this distinction. I felt that the discourse of black theology might actually prevent serious consideration of the wider range of meaning in religion as a form of life, thought, and action. It was not my intention in this article to give a full-blown description of any African American religion. I wanted to provide the basis for these religions as the temporal/spatial template for an alternate discourse and epistemology in the modern world. From this point of view, my position seems close to that of V. Y. Mudimbe's characterization of gnosis.31<br>

Abstract: The Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP), as a fifty-year-old movement of both phenomenologically and existentially disposed philosophers, may regard Franz Brentano (1838–1917) as at least a grandfather. For many SPEP members, including myself until very recently, Brentano has been known in a rather vague and inauthentic empty intention merely as the teacher of Husserl, foremost in regard to some aspects of the doctrine of intentionality. Upon closer inspection this is pitifully shortsighted, and I have come to believe that the phenomenologist's lineage to the grandfather is not to be forgotten and that retrieving it may bring out not only differences but surprising enrichments that will emerge through wrestling with the differences.
         
                  As merely one example, I want to discuss Brentanian propositions regarding the individuality of the I.1<br>

Abstract: Some of the goals in SPEP's founding included providing occasions for presenting papers and carrying out formal and informal discussions as well as making opportunities for the formation of collegiality among philosophers from many different schools in the context of the phenomenological/existential traditions. They also included the crucial development of book series and journals for the publication of new work and translations of German and French works in these traditions. The German heritage, especially in the context of SPEP, brought with it an emphasis on the importance of the history of philosophy that was unique in the professional atmosphere in philosophy in the United States at that time. That heritage taught that Kant's work, for example, had significance that exceeded considerably part 1 of
         The Critique of Pure Reason. Plato, Aristotle, medieval thought, Hegel, and many other nineteenth-century German philosophers were part of the phenomenological canon in 1961, in addition to the modern period that analytic philosophers regularly taught. The European tradition that arrived in North America recognized those philosophers in the Western tradition as alive in contemporary thought, as distinct to being relics in a theoretical museum with the quaint name of the History of Philosophy. An inherent intention in SPEP's founding was to introduce phenomenology and existential thought to academics and intellectuals in this country and to make that introduction in the context of the history of Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: I said that the earlier contrast of idol and icon and the later fivefold analysis of the saturated phenomenon were of special interest in the present context. How so? Quite unexpectedly, we discover that both analyses invoke the concept of an inverted intentionality. In the experience of the icon (as distinct from the idol) we find “a nearly perfect inversion” of the intentionality that constitutes the idol as such: “If man, by his gaze, renders the idol possible, in reverent contemplation of the icon, on the contrary, the gaze of the invisible, in person, aims at man…. [T]he icon opens in a face that gazes at our gazes … offering its spectacle to be transgressed—not to be seen, but to be venerated…. [T]he intention here issues from infinity…. [H]ere our gaze becomes the optical mirror of that at which it looks only by finding itself more radically looked at.”

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not envision so explicit an invitation (or even exhortation) to action. Rather he insists on understanding how poetic or fictional texts refer to the world outside of language. In a significant move, Ricoeur rejects the false choice between conceiving of a text as either a transparent window into conscious authorial intention or as a closed, self-referential world. His approach instead treats authorship as one textual influence among many. Ricoeur says that his formulation of refiguration “is part of a hermeneutics that aims less at restoring the author's intention behind the text than at making explicit the movement by which the text unfolds, as it were, a world in front of itself” (1984, 1:81). Here Ricoeur directly engages the poststructuralist critique of authorial intention and textual reference. Yet he offers an insightful and sensible alternative to the idea that texts should be understood primarily as effects of language.
         
               Like Ricoeur, I see authorial/creative intention as an important aspect of reading texts of public memory that is nonetheless only part of the broader context of textual production and address. The intentions of creators leave indelible marks on the texts and thus on the public memories they disseminate. But many other factors affect the nature of a text, and Ricoeur's approach emphasizes that reality.12<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Utopian studies have evolved to the point of establishing a history of the concept of utopia. However, what is often left out in utopian studies is how this concept is communicated or mediated via symbols and communicative conventions. This is specifically the province of rhetoric. From this perspective, we might define a utopian rhetoric as the use of symbolic communication in an attempt to move the actual state of human affairs into alignment with an imagined, better state of affairs—that is, a utopia, either one shared by the community or one invented by the speaker or both. All sorts of utopia, then, are forms of rhetoric, but the reverse is not always true. Rhetoric that functions only to sell a product or win a court case at any cost, rhetoric that uses any means necessary to win something transient, will not necessarily reach for a culture's highest ideas of what is good—unless personal gain is itself the highest good. This latter type of rhetoric simply aims at immediate effect in the audience and can be defined as pragmatic. Utopian rhetoric, on the other hand, appeals to broad cultural ideals and organizing principles. It can be equated with what the rhetorical tradition has called “philosophical rhetoric,” and it generally presumes an ethical intention. This type of rhetoric can be both culturally formative and potentially devastating if misused.<br>
