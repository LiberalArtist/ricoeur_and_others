  Author(s) Utley Ebony A.<br>
  Abstract: “Hermeneutical rhetoric” is the counterpart of Steven Mailloux’s “rhetorical hermeneutics.” In an article bearing that title and more extensively in his book
                  Rhetorical Power, Mailloux offers an “antitheory theory” of interpretation that situates literary hermeneutics within the context of rhetorical exchange.¹ Traditional literary theory, Mailloux argues, relies upon a general conception of interpretation as the basis for justifying particular interpretative acts. Such “theory” takes two forms—“textual realism,” where meaning is found in the text, and “readerly idealism,” where meaning is made through intersubjective agreements among a community of interpreters. As theories, these positions are diametrically opposed, but, Mailloux maintains,<br>

  Author(s) Graham Tyler<br>
  Abstract: I discovered Girard during my junior year at Stanford University, in the spring of 1994. At that time, my primary intellectual worldview was typical of the literary theoretical climate of the day: deconstruction. Not well schooled in the work of Derrida and others engaged in that mode of criticism, I was easily led to believe that infinite interpretations (and, thus, no one true interpretation) of a text were always possible. I read

  Abstract: The vicissitudes of authorship revisited in chapter 6 point to a larger issue. Since around 2000 there has been a lot of musicological effort lavished on the “workconcept” and the competing claims of the fixed, authoritative musical work and the creative act of performance, mostly to the detriment of the work. Like most such binary quarrels, this one reveals a little and obscures a lot. It certainly oversimplifies the historical situation, which is full of complex instances in which the roles of the work—as inscription, conception, or instruction—and of performance—as animation, interpretation, or reproduction—meet, mix, and<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: Interpreting Musicis a comprehensive essay on understanding musical meaning and performing music meaningfully-"interpreting music" in both senses of the term. Synthesizing and advancing two decades of highly influential work, Lawrence Kramer fundamentally rethinks the concepts of work, score, performance, performativity, interpretation, and meaning-even the very concept of music-while breaking down conventional wisdom and received ideas. Kramer argues that music, far from being closed to interpretation, is ideally open to it, and that musical interpretation is the paradigm of interpretation in general. The book illustrates the many dimensions of interpreting music through a series of case studies drawn from the classical repertoire, but its methods and principles carry over to other repertoires just as they carry beyond music by workingthroughmusic to wider philosophical and cultural questions.<br>

  Abstract: Both modernity and its artistic offshoot, modernism, famously involve skepticism and confusion, widespread unintelligibility and the negation of meaning. A few iconic names make the point nicely: Schoenberg. Joyce. Eliot. Picasso. Time may long since have blunted their radical edge, but the memory remains sharp. How, then, does either modernism or modernity fit, except as a tragic or celebratory passage away from bygone clarities and promises, in a historically sensitive theory of interpretation? Is a hermeneutics of the modern and the modernist possible?<br>

  Abstract: Madness or psychotic illness fundamentally challenges local understandings of human nature, as well as the theorization of subjectivity. Societies and individuals understand madness in various ways: as possession by haunting spirits, a flight from reason, a regression to childlike or primitive states, an essential mode of being in the world and a distinctive form of human subjectivity, the entry into an alternative world, or a mode of deeply disturbed and pathological subjectivity reflecting disordered brain chemistry. Whatever the interpretation, the chaotic and disturbing qualities of psychosis are deeply threatening to those undergoing the experience as well as to their families<br>

I have avoided any attempt to hold that reading of Homer up against others, to affirm or to deny it, beyond occasional observations on analogies between these ancient interpretive critics and those of our own time. My reticence on this score reveals an implicit model of reading with similarities to Bloom’s, and no doubt in part derivative from it.

  Author(s): Morgan Daniel<br>
  Abstract: With
      Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinema, Daniel Morgan makes a significant contribution to scholarship on Jean-Luc Godard, especially his films and videos since the late 1980s, some of the most notoriously difficult works in contemporary cinema. Through detailed analyses of extended sequences, technical innovations, and formal experiments, Morgan provides an original interpretation of a series of several internally related films-Soigne ta droite(Keep Your Right Up, 1987),Nouvelle vague(New Wave, 1990), andAllemagne 90 neuf zéro(Germany 90 Nine Zero, 1991)-and the monumental late video work,Histoire(s) du cinéma(1988-1998). Taking up a range of topics, including the role of nature and natural beauty, the relation between history and cinema, and the interactions between film and video, the book provides a distinctive account of the cinematic and intellectual ambitions of Godard's late work. At the same time,Late Godard and the Possibilities of Cinemaprovides a new direction for the fields of film and philosophy by drawing on the idealist and romantic tradition of philosophical aesthetics, which rarely finds an articulation within film studies. In using the tradition of aesthetics to illuminate Godard's late films and videos, Morgan shows that these works transform the basic terms and categories of aesthetics in and for the cinema.<br>

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

  Book Title: Controlling Contested Places-Late Antique Antioch and the Spatial Politics of Religious Controversy<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Shepardson Christine<br>
  Abstract: From constructing new buildings to describing rival-controlled areas as morally and physically dangerous, leaders in late antiquity fundamentally shaped their physical environment and thus the events that unfolded within it.
      Controlling Contested Placesmaps the city of Antioch (Antakya, Turkey) through the topographically sensitive vocabulary of cultural geography, demonstrating the critical role played by physical and rhetorical spatial contests during the tumultuous fourth century. Paying close attention to the manipulation of physical places, Christine Shepardson exposes some of the powerful forces that structured the development of religious orthodoxy and orthopraxy in the late Roman Empire.Theological claims and political support were not the only significant factors in determining which Christian communities gained authority around the Empire. Rather, Antioch's urban and rural places, far from being an inert backdrop against which events transpired, were ever-shifting sites of, and tools for, the negotiation of power, authority, and religious identity. This book traces the ways in which leaders like John Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Libanius encouraged their audiences to modify their daily behaviors and transform their interpretation of the world (and landscape) around them. Shepardson argues that examples from Antioch were echoed around the Mediterranean world, and similar types of physical and rhetorical manipulations continue to shape the politics of identity and perceptions of religious orthodoxy to this day.<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Abstract: Kevin J. Vanhoozer, one of the most creative and constructive evangelical theologians currently working, is best known for his work in theological prolegomena and the theological interpretation of Scripture.¹ Questions about the relationship between the Bible and systematic theology initially directed his work to hermeneutics, and interdisciplinary engagement with hermeneutical and literary theory has been a staple in his research ever since.² Much like Thiselton before him, Vanhoozer has endeavored to utilize the insights of non-theological resources like contemporary hermeneutical theory in biblical interpretation and Christian theology. However, in contrast to Thiselton’s descriptive approach, Vanhoozer’s approach to theological hermeneutics is<br>

  Book Title: The Mission of Demythologizing-Rudolf Bultmann's Dialectical Theology<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Congdon David W.<br>
  Abstract: Since 1941, Rudolf Bultmann’s program of demythologizing has been the subject of constant debate, widely held to indicate Bultmann’s departure from the dialectical theology he once shared with Karl Barth. In the 1950s, Barth referred to their relationship as that of a whale and an elephant: incapable of meaningful communication. This study proposes a contrary reading of demythologizing as the hermeneutical fulfillment of dialectical theology on the basis of a reinterpretation of Barth’s theological project. As such, the volume argues that dialectical theology is fundamentally governed by a missionary logic. Bultmann’s hermeneutical theology extends this dialectical, missionary theology into the field of interpretation. Contrary to many critics, the message of God’s saving work in Christ, and not modern science, funds Bultmann’s hermeneutical program. Like Barth’s own revolution, Bultmann’s program addresses a false relation between gospel and culture. Negatively, demythologizing is a program of deconstantinizing, opposing the objectifying conflation of kerygma and culture that he calls “myth.” Positively, demythologizing is a form of intercultural hermeneutics, composed of preunderstanding and self-understanding. Demythologizing is therefore a missionary hermeneutic of intercultural translation.<br>

  Book Title: Figures of a Changing World: Metaphor and the Emergence of Modern Culture-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BERGER HARRY<br>
  Abstract: Figures of a Changing World offers a dramatic new account of cultural change, an account based on the distinction between two familiar rhetorical figures, metonymy and metaphor. The book treats metonymy as the basic organizing trope of traditional culture and metaphor as the basic organizing trope of modern culture. On the one hand, metonymies present themselves as analogies that articulate or reaffirm preexisting states of affairs. They are guarantors of facticity, a term that can be translated or defined as fact-like-ness. On the other hand, metaphors challenge the similarity they claim to establish, in order to feature departures from preexisting states of affairs. On the basis of this distinction, the author argues that metaphor and metonymy can be used as instruments both for the large-scale interpretation of tensions in cultural change and for the micro-interpretation of tensions within particular texts. In addressing the functioning of the two terms, the author draws upon and critiques the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, Roman Jakobson, Christian Metz, Paul Ricoeur, Umberto Eco, Edmund Leach, and Paul de Man.<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

  Abstract: Not every construal of the theological enterprise will be able to entertain the possibility of Nietzsche as a resource, if not exactly an ally. For example, if theology interprets itself onto-theologically, it will be unable to see any ambiguity or irony in his self-designations as immoralist and anti-Christ. They will simply be the literal confessions of a loathed enemy. The possibility of Nietzsche as
                     ancilla theolugiaepresupposes at least an interruption of the interpretation of theology in onto-theo-logical terms.<br>

  Book Title: For Derrida-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller J. Hillis<br>
  Abstract: This book-the culmination of forty years of friendship between J. Hillis Miller and Jacques Derrida, during which Miller also closely followed all Derrida's writings and seminars-is for Derridain two senses. It is for him,dedicated to his memory. The chapters also speak, in acts of reading, as advocates for Derrida's work. They focus especially on Derrida's late work, including passages from the last, as yet unpublished, seminars. The chapters are partial to Derrida,on his side, taking his part, gratefully submitting themselves to the demand made by Derrida's writings to be read-slowly, carefully, faithfully, with close attention to semantic detail.The chapters do not progress forward to tell a sequential story. They are, rather, a series of perspectives on the heterogeneity of Derrida's work, or forays into that heterogeneity.The chief goal has been, to borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, plainly to propoundwhat Derrida says. The book aims, above all, to render Derrida's writings justice. It should be remembered, however, that, according to Derrida himself, every rendering of justice is also a transformative interpretation. A book like this one is not a substitute for reading Derrida for oneself. It is to be hoped that it will encourage readers to do just that.<br>

  Abstract: Confucianism, as the dominant philosophical/cultural system of East Asia that has evolved over two millennia, is multidimensional and multilayered. Consequently, its interpretations diverge depending on which elements get emphasized and how they are arranged. Most, if not all, of such interpretations may contain some truth, but no one interpretation may capture the whole monolithic and unchangeable “Truth” of Confucianism. Confucianism is a
                  livingtradition in perpetual motion and survives through mutations, reflecting the needs and concerns of each generation of the cultural community. This does not mean that Confucianism does not contain some essence that would remain constant. Confucian values<br>

  Abstract: “Reading” is a term that, through overuse, can easily become confused with interpretation. In fact, there is a crucial difference: Reading involves the undoing of interpretative figures; because it is not an operation opposed to the understanding but rather a precondition for it, it allows us to question whether the synthetic moves of the understanding can close off a text. It leads away from meaning to such problems as the text’s constitution and meaning generation. Unlike interpretation, which implies a development over the course of a narrative toward a single figure reconciling all its diverse moments, reading states the logic<br>

  Abstract: Contemporary philosophers may be divided into two classes: those who believe in normative epistemological discourse governed by canons of objectivity and rationality continuous with those of science, and those who think of cognitive discourse as one among many claimants to meaning. Richard Rorty argues that, if there is “no common commensurating ground between them, all we can do is be hermeneutic about the opposition.”¹ In this interpretation, it is futile to try to breach the distinctive discursive modes and ontological claims separating the work of Quine and Derrida.

  Book Title: Scrolls of Love: Ruth and the Song of Songs-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Stahlberg Lesleigh Cushing<br>
  Abstract: Scrolls of Love is a book of unions. Edited by a Jew and a Christian who are united by a shared passion for the Bible and a common literary hermeneutic, it joins two biblical scrolls and gathers around them a diverse community of interpreters. It brings together Ruth and the Song of Songs, two seemingly disparate texts of the Hebrew Bible, and reads them through a number of the methodological and theological perspectives. Respectful of traditional biblical scholarship, the collection of essays moves beyond it; alert to contemporary trends, the volume returns venerable interpretive tradition to center stage. Most significantly, it is interfaith. Despite the fact that Jews and Christians share a common text in the Hebrew Scripture, the two communities have read their Bibles in isolation from one another, in ignorance of the richness of the other's traditions of reading. Scrolls of Love brings the two traditions into dialogue, enriching established modes of interpretation with unconventional ones. The result is a volume that sets rabbinic, patristic, and medieval readings alongside feminist, psychoanalytic, and autobiographical ones, combining historical, literary, and textual criticism with a variety of artistic reinterpretations-wood cuts and paper cuts, poetry and fiction. Some of the works are scholarly, with the requisite footnotes to draw readers to further inquiry: others are more reflective than analytic, allowing readers to see what it means to live intimately with Scripture. As a unity, the collection presents Ruth and Song of Songs not only as ancient texts that deserve to be treasured but as old worlds capable of begetting the new.<br>

  Book Title: Edgar Allen Poe: A Phenomenological View-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>

  Abstract: The book begins with a methodological chapter that sets out the assumptions and procedures of the approach. This is followed by analyses of Poe's major works, exploring such special problems as Poe's treatment of the material world, including technology; the interrelation of body and consciousness; poetic voice; attitudes toward women; and the will to affirmation, plenitude, and unity. The center of interest is neither Poe's biography nor environment but always the meaning of Poe's words. Because these works are shaped by a single imagination and because they are experienced in time, as a process, each work has its own "way of going." The aim of the interpretation is to find this way and go along with it; to live each work dynamically, as it "happens," while tracing its interaction with other works.<br>

  Book Title: Intention Interpretation-  Publisher: Temple University Press<br>
  Author(s): ISEMINGER GARY<br>
  Abstract: "...an excellent and comprehensive discussion of a debate that was initiated in this century in William Wimsatt's and Monroe C. Beardsley's influential article 'The Intentional Fallacy.'...this is a splendidly conceived and very useful collection of essays. Readers will want to take issue with the arguments of individual authors, but this is to be expected in a volume at the cutting edge of a fertile philosophical controversy." --David Novitz, The Philosophical Quarterly "What is the connection, if any, between the author's intentions in (while) writing a work of literature and the truth (acceptability, validity) of interpretive statements about it?" With this question, Gary Isminger introduces a literary debate that has been waged for the past four decades and is addressed by philosophers and literary theorists in Intention and Interpretation. Thirteen essays discuss the role of appeals to the author's intention in interpreting works of literature. A well-known argument by E.D. Hirsch serves as the basic text, in which he defends the appeal to the author's intention against Wimsatt and Beardsley's claim that such an appeal involved "the intentional fallacy." The essays, mostly commissioned by the editor, explore the presuppositions and consequences of arguing for the importance of the author's intentions in the way Hirsch does. Connections emerge between this issue and many fundamental issues in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind as well as in aesthetics. The (old) "New Criticism" and current Post-Structuralism tend to agree in disenfranchising the author, and many people now are disinclined even to consider the alternative. Hirsch demurs, and arguments like his deserve the careful attention, both from critics and sympathizers, that they receive here. Literary scholars and philosophers who are sympathetic to Continental as well as to Anglo-American styles of philosophy are among the contributors.

  Book Title: Puzzling the Parables of Jesus-Methods and Interpretations<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Ruben<br>
  Abstract: Modern scholarship on the parables has long been preoccupied with asking what Jesus himself said and what he intended to accomplish with his parables. Ruben Zimmermann moves beyond that agenda to explore the dynamics of parabolic speech in all its rich complexity. Introductory chapters address the history of research and distinguish historical from literary and reader-oriented approaches, then set out a postmodern hermeneutic that analyzes narrative elements and context, maps the sociohistorical background, explores stock metaphors and symbols, and opens up contemporary horizons of interpretation. Subsequent chapters then focus on one parable from early Christian sources (Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and the Gospel of Thomas) to explore how parables function in each literary context. Over all reigns the principle that the meaning or theological “message" of a parable cannot be extracted from the parabolic form; thus the parables continue to invite hearers' and readers' involvement to the present day.<br>

  Book Title: The arc and the machine-Narrative and new media<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bassett Caroline<br>
  Abstract: The Arc and the machine is a timely and original defence of narrative in an age of information. Stressing interpretation and experience alongside affect and sensation it convincingly argues that narrative is key to contemporary forms of cultural production and to the practice of contemporary life. Re-appraising the prospects for narrative in the digital age, it insists on the centrality of narrative to informational culture and provokes a critical re-appraisal of how innovations in information technology as a material cultural form can be understood and assessed. The book offers a careful exploration of narrative theory, a sophisticated critique of techno-cultural writing, and a series of tightly focused case studies. All of which point the way to a restoration of a critical - rather than celebratory approaches - to new media. The scope and range of this book is broad, its argumentation careful and exacting, and its conclusions exciting.<br>

  Abstract: In an intriguing essay reprinted in

  Abstract: This article surveys Bonhoeffer’s early education in biblical studies, with a focus on his different encounters with Adolf Schlatter and Karl Barth. I propose that Bonhoeffer’s understanding of the tools of the historical-critical method in relation to a theologically focussed form of biblical interpretation was formed in this initial period, and that the relationship between history and revelation that he landed upon was not antithetical but complementary. Historical criticism was the servant of interpreting the Bible as revealed Scripture, but it was nevertheless an essential aspect of the interpretative process.

But such acknowledgment presupposes a separation from that which one responds to, or more generally, it presupposes finitude.

  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

  Book Title: The Incarnate Lord-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>

  Abstract: The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

For him it is the indication of the Nazarene’s disillusioned apocalypticism.² Protestant theologians, meanwhile, have found warrant in this Scriptural text for a theology of Christ’s “god-forsakenness” experienced for us as a dimension of redemption.

  Book Title: The Renaissance of emotion-Understanding affect in Shakespeare and his contemporaries<br>
  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Sullivan Erin<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays offers a major reassessment of the meaning and significance of emotional experience in the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Recent scholarship on early modern emotion has relied on a medical-historical approach, resulting in a picture of emotional experience that stresses the dominance of the material, humoral body. The Renaissance of emotion seeks to redress this balance by examining the ways in which early modern texts explore emotional experience from perspectives other than humoral medicine. The chapters in the book seek to demonstrate how open, creative and agency-ridden the experience and interpretation of emotion could be. Taken individually, the chapters offer much-needed investigations into previously overlooked areas of emotional experience and signification; taken together, they offer a thorough re-evaluation of the cultural priorities and phenomenological principles that shaped the understanding of the emotive self in the early modern period. The Renaissance of emotion will be of particular interest to students and scholars of Shakespeare and Renaissance literature, the history of emotion, theatre and cultural history, and the history of ideas.<br>

  Abstract: When viewed in terms of the substantial numbers of Irish people who emigrated during the nineteenth century, mainly to the United States, and during the twentieth century, mainly to Britain, those who came either voluntarily or involuntarily to Australia were comparatively few. Yet, in terms of their proportion of the Australian population, the Irish and their descendants loomed larger than in any other major emigrant destination (Fitzpatrick, 1994: 6–7). Therefore, whether or not one agrees with the bold interpretation of Patrick O’Farrell (1933–2003) quoted above, it is indisputable that for some 150 years after European settlement of the<br>

  Book Title: Memory, Narrative and the Great War-Rifleman Patrick MacGill and the Construction of Wartime Experience<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Taylor David<br>
  Abstract: Memory, Narrative and the Great War provides a detailed examination of the varied and complex war writings of a relatively marginal figure, Patrick MacGill, within a general framework of our current pre-occupation with blood, mud and suffering. In particular, it seeks to explain how his interpretation of war shifted from the heroic wartime autobiographical trilogy, with its emphasis on 'the romance of the rifleman' to the pessimistic and guilt-ridden interpretations in his post-war novel, Fear!, and play, Suspense. Through an exploration of the way in which war-time experiences were remembered (and re-remembered) and retold in strikingly different narratives, and using insights from cognitive psychology, it is argued that there is no contradiction between these two seemingly opposing views. Instead it is argued that, given the present orientation and problem-solving nature of both memory and narrative, the different interpretations are both 'true' in the sense that they throw light on the ongoing way in which MacGill came to terms with his experiences of war. This in turn has implications for broader interpretations of the Great War, which has increasingly be seen in terms of futile suffering, not least because of the eloquent testimony of ex-Great War soldiers, reflecting on their experiences many years after the event. Without suggesting that such testimony is invalid, it is argued that this is one view but not the only view of the war. Rather wartime memory and narrative is more akin to an ever-changing kaleidoscope, in which pieces of memory take on different (but equally valid) shapes as they are shaken with the passing of time.<br>

However, it was not just in the realm of doctrine, but also ethics, that such a revolutionary archaeology came to light. In 1966 Joseph Fletcher published his immensely popular

  Book Title: Carnal Hermeneutics-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): TREANOR BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: Building on a hermeneutic tradition in which accounts of carnal embodiment are overlooked, misunderstood, or underdeveloped, this work initiates a new field of study and concern. Carnal Hermeneutics provides a philosophical approach to the body as interpretation. Transcending the traditional dualism of rational understanding and embodied sensibility, the volume argues that our most carnal sensations are already interpretations. Because interpretation truly goes "all the way down," carnal hermeneutics rejects the opposition of language to sensibility, word to flesh, text to body. In this volume, an impressive array of today's preeminent philosophers seek to interpret the surplus of meaning that arises from our carnal embodiment, its role in our experience and understanding, and its engagement with the wider world.<br>

  Abstract: This volume is derived, in concept, from a conference held in honour of John Evans by the School of History and Archaeology and The Prehistoric Society at Cardiff University in March 2006. It brings together papers that address themes and landscapes on a variety of levels. They cover geographical, methodological and thematic areas that were of interest to, and had been studied by, John Evans. The volume is divided into five sections, which echo themes of importance in British prehistory. They include papers on aspects of environmental archaeology, experiments and philosophy; new research on the nature of woodland on the chalklands of southern England; coasts and islands; people, process and social order, and snails and shells - a strong part of John Evans' career. This volume presents a range of papers examining people's interaction with the landscape in all its forms. The papers provide a diverse but cohesive picture of how archaeological landscapes are viewed within current research frameworks and approaches, while also paying tribute to the innovative and inspirational work of one of the leading protagonists of environmental archaeology and the holistic approach to landscape interpretation.<br>

Building upon the work of post-Constantinians John Howard Yoder and Stanley Hauerwas and upon the Trinitarian Spirit-Christology of Leopoldo Sánchez, this account provides a framework for seeing one’s Christian life as one transformed by the Spirit. Snavely rejects the characterisation of life in the Spirit as bringing sinners to faith, and instead proposes that as Jesus lived as the Son of the Father in the Spirit, the Spirit also makes other sons of the father in the image of Jesus. This Trinitarian interpretation shows the Christian life as being one of total trust in God with one’s own life, and after death living in Jesus’ resurrected life in the Spirit. Snavely’s account calls for a reimagining of the church and the Christian life in terms of ecclesial structure, Christian discipleship and the Christian view of marriage. Life in the Spirit will not only help Christians to have a better understanding of the place of vocation in the world as witnesses to the lordship of Jesus Christ, but it will also promote unity in the body of Christ based on the actual unity that all his adopted sons and daughters already have by belonging to Jesus Christ’s life in the Spirit.<br>

  Book Title: The Joshua Delusion?-Rethinking Genocide in the Bible<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Moberly R.W.L.<br>
  Abstract: Many Christians wrestle with biblical passages in which God commands the slaughter of the Canaanites - men, women, and children. The issue of the morality of the biblical God is one of the major challenges for faith today. How can such texts be Holy Scripture? In this bold and innovative book, Douglas Earl grasps the bull by the horns and guides readers to new and unexpected ways of looking at the book of Joshua. Drawing on insights from the early church and from modern scholarship, Earl argues that we have mistakenly read Joshua as a straightforward historical account and have ended up with a genocidal God. In contrast, Earl offers a theological interpretation in which the mass killing of Canaanites is a deliberate use of myth to make important theological points that are still valid today. Christopher J. H. Wright then offers a thoughtful response to Earl's provocative views. The book closes with Earl's reply to Wright and readers are encouraged to continue the debate.<br>

  Author(s) WABEL THOMAS<br>
  Abstract: In his categorial semiotics and phenomenology, Charles Sanders Peirce arrives at a fundamental triadic structure that, he claims, shapes all possible experience and reality alike. The subject—seen as the “interpretant” in a triadic semiotic process—becomes an instance in the self-interpretation of the universe of signs. Thus, perception of reality and reality itself coincide. This can be experienced in what Peirce calls the category of “Firstness.” Following Peirce, the contemplation of reality in the immediate experience of its quality (Firstness) is a phenomenological task. In Peirce’s “humble argument” for the reality of God, the experience of Firstness can account<br>

  Book Title: Beyond Old and New Perspectives on Paul-Reflections on the Work of Douglas Campbell<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Adams Edward<br>
  Abstract: In his work 'Deliverance of God' Douglas Campbell presents what Chris Tilling considers a "complete rereading of Paul’s letters that genuinely offers a way beyond problems associated with old and new perspectives. And his resultant picture of Paul’s theology generally, and the Apostle’s soteriology particularly, is beautiful, liberating, consistent, exegetically rigorous, theologically aware and pastorally compelling. It captures, I think, the best of the old perspective, with its concern to speak energetically about the God who saves, and it takes seriously the concerns of the new perspective on Second Temple Judaism. But in remarkable and jarringly elegant ways, it moves beyond them both." This collection of essays is divided into two sections. Part One analyses key aspects of Campbell’s account of the problem confronting readers of Paul. Part Two analyses key aspects of Campbell’s proposed solution to to the current confused state of Pauline interpretation. This book is essential reading for anyone involved in the study of Paul.<br>

  Book Title: Reading Scripture to Hear God-Kevin Vanhoozer and Henri de Lubac on God's Use of Scripture in the Economy of Redemption<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Storer Kevin<br>
  Abstract: Recent theological discussions between Catholics and Evangelicals have generated a renewed appreciation for God's ongoing use of Scripture for self-mediation to the Church. Noting the significant influence of Henri de Lubac (one of the drafters of 'Dei Verbum' and proponent of a renewal of the Patristic and Medieval emphasis on a spiritual sense of Scripture), and Kevin Vanhoozer (the leading Evangelical proponent of a theological interpretation of Scripture), Kevin Storer seeks to draw Evangelical and Catholic theologians into dialogue about God's ongoing use of Scripture in the economy of redemption. Storer suggests that a number of traditional tensions between Catholics and Evangelicals, such as the literal or spiritual sense of Scripture, a sacramental or a covenantal model of God's self-mediation, and an emphasis on the authority of Scripture or the authority of the Church, can be eased by shifting greater focus upon God's ongoing use of creaturely realities for the building of the Church in union with Christ. This project seeks to enable Evangelicals to appropriate the insights of de Lubac's Catholic Ressourcement project, while also encouraging Catholic theologians to appreciate Vanhoozer's Evangelical emphasis on God's use of the literal sense of Scripture to build the Church.<br>

  Abstract: The cumulative argument of this book has been that a much greater similarity between Vanhoozer and de Lubac (and hence between much Evangelical and Catholic theological interpretation of Scripture) can be seen when explicit focus is placed upon God’s use of Scripture and church in the economy of redemption. I have argued that Vanhoozer’s development of an economy of communication is very similar to de Lubac’s development of a sacramental ontology, as both insist on God’s ongoing self-mediation through Scripture, both develop an understanding of scriptural meaning which requires participation and which emerges in the whole economy of redemption, and<br>

For four years, Canadian Catholic bishops met with their peers from around the globe to reflect on and debate the pressing issues facing the church.

  Abstract: The first paperback edition of a classic of American constitutional theory. The book is divided into two parts.

In Part II the author offers a descriptive sociology of constitutional doctrine and raises critical questions as to whether a grand theory is necessary, is it possible to construct a coherent, useful grand theory, and is construction of an uncontroversial grand theory possible?Professor Tushnet's new Afterword is organized in parallel fashion to the original text.

                  Metaphysics, Aristotle says that “all men suppose what is called wisdom (sophia) to deal with the first causes (aitia) and the principles (archai) of things,” and that it is these causes and principles that he proposes to study in this work.¹ During the thirteenth century the recent recovery of Aristotle’s works of natural philosophy (Physics, Metaphysics, De anima, Meteora), resulted in an evolution of the understanding of causality, which in turn resulted in remarkable developments in biblical interpretation.² Especially at the universities of Paris and Oxford commentators reevaluated conventional anthropological presuppositions and reassessed the human<br>

  Abstract: We have seen that
                  Dei Verbumexpansively recapitulates medieval exegesis. Building on the letter as the intrinsic symbol of the spirit, it understands divine revelation as a system of continuous symbols that join together Christ, his words and works, the apostolic tradition of the church, and the written scriptures and their interpretation. Whenever a synthesis is grounded in symbolism, its aesthetic dimension cannot help but be invoked. Heidegger reminds us, for instance, that symbolism constitutes the essence of art.¹ In the creative fashioning of an artifact, truth itself is preserved as beauty. Accordingly, if the Son is the Father’s image,<br>

  Book Title: Ethos and Narrative Interpretation-The Negotiation of Values in Fiction<br>

  Abstract: Demonstrating the extent to which ethos attributions, and hence, interpretive acts, play a tacit role in many methods of narratological analysis, Korthals Altes also questions the agenda and epistemological status of various narratologies, both classical and post-classical. Her approach, rooted in a broad understanding of the role and circulation of narrative art in culture, rehabilitates interpretation, both as a tool and as an object of investigation in narrative studies.<br>

  Book Title: Writing and Materiality in China-Essays in Honor of Patrick Hanan<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Widmer Ellen<br>
  Abstract: Speaking about Chinese writing entails thinking about how writing speaks through various media. In the guises of the written character and its imprints, traces, or ruins, writing is more than textuality. The goal of this volume is to consider the relationship of writing to materiality in China’s literary history and to ponder the physical aspects of the production and circulation of writing. To speak of the thing-ness of writing is to understand it as a thing in constant motion, transported from one place or time to another, one genre or medium to another, one person or public to another. Thinking about writing as the material product of a culture shifts the emphasis from the author as the creator and ultimate arbiter of a text’s meaning to the editors, publishers, collectors, and readers through whose hands a text is reshaped, disseminated, and given new meanings. By yoking writing and materiality, the contributors to this volume aim to bypass the tendency to oppose form and content, words and things, documents and artifacts, to rethink key issues in the interpretation of Chinese literary and visual culture.<br>

Freud, 1923b:235). This discovery or institution of the unconscious, that dark realm that governs us but which we cannot govern, whose contents express themselves obliquely—not transparently—in displacements, sublimations, condensations, and substitutions, was to be defining for psychoanalysis.

  Book Title: Hermeneutics Ancient and Modern-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging meditation on the nature and purpose of hermeneutics, Gerald L. Bruns argues that hermeneutics is not merely a contemporary theory but an extended family of questions about understanding and interpretation that have multiple and conflicting histories going back to before the beginning of writing.What does it mean to understand a riddle, an action, a concept, a law, an alien culture, or oneself? Bruns expands our sense of the horizons of hermeneutics by situating its basic questions against a background of different cultural traditions and philosophical topics. He discusses, for example, the interpretation of oracles, the silencing of the muses and the writing of history, the quarrel between philosophy and poetry, the canonization of sacred texts, the nature of allegorical exegesis, rabbinical midrash, the mystical exegesis of the Qur'an, the rise of literalism and the individual interpreter, and the nature of Romantic hermeneutics. Dealing with thinkers ranging from Socrates to Luther to Wordsworth to Ricoeur, Bruns also ponders several basic dilemmas about the nature of hermeneutical experience, the meaning of tradition, the hermeneutical function of narrative, and the conflict between truth and freedom in philosophy and literature. His eloquent book demonstrates the continuing power of hermeneutical thinking to open up questions about the world and our place in it.<br>

This is to say that each person’s experience of the city organizes an intricately shifting site for the production and exchange of meaning.

  Book Title: An Archaeology of Prehistoric Bodies and Embodied Identities in the Eastern Mediterranean-  Publisher: Oxbow Books<br>
  Author(s): PAPADATOS YIANNIS<br>
  Abstract: In the long tradition of the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean bodies have held a prominent role in the form of figurines, frescos, or skeletal remains, and have even been responsible for sparking captivating portrayals of the Mother-Goddess cult, the elegant women of Minoan Crete or the deeds of heroic men. Growing literature on the archaeology and anthropology of the body has raised awareness about the dynamic and multifaceted role of the body in experiencing the world and in the construction, performance and negotiation of social identity. In these 28 thematically arranged papers, specialists in the archaeology of the eastern Mediterranean confront the perceived invisibility of past bodies and ask new research questions. Contributors discuss new and old evidence; they examine how bodies intersect with the material world, and explore the role of body-situated experiences in creating distinct social and other identities. Papers range chronologically from the Palaeolithic to the Early Iron Age and cover the geographical regions of the Aegean, Cyprus and the Near East. They highlight the new possibilities that emerge for the interpretation of the prehistoric eastern Mediterranean through a combined use of body-focused methodological and theoretical perspectives that are nevertheless grounded in the archaeological record.<br>

These scales of analysis can include individuals interacting for only a few hours in the course of a brief encounter, to larger groups and for longer periods, in the context of complex social networks within extended spatial units (Gamble 1999, 67–8). The study of individuals in particular, has generally been regarded as beyond the resolution of the Palaeolithic record (Clark 1992, 107),<br>

  Abstract: Light figures being; darkness, death. Bridging mathematical science, semantics, rhetoric, grammar, and major poems, Judith H. Anderson seeks to negotiate writings from multiple disciplines in the shared terms of poiesis and figuration rather than as cultural opposites. Analogy, a type of metaphor, has always been the connector of the known to the unknown, the sensible to the infinite. Anderson’s study moves from the figuration of light and death to the history of analogy and its pertinence to light in physics and metaphysics, from Kepler to Donne, Spenser, and Milton. Topics proliferate: creativity, optics, the relation of literature to science, the methodology of thought and argument, and the processes of narrative, discovery, and interpretation.<br>

  Book Title: Prophetic Politics-Emmanuel Levinas and the Sanctification of Suffering<br>
  Publisher: Ohio University Press<br>
  Author(s): HAROLD PHILIP J.<br>
  Abstract: In
      Prophetic Politics,Philip J. Haroldoffers an original interpretation of the political dimension of Emmanuel Levinas's thought. Harold argues that Levinas's mature position inOtherwise Than Beingbreaks radically with the dialogical inclinations of his earlierTotality and Infinityand that transformation manifests itself most clearly in the peculiar nature of Levinas's relationship to politics.Levinas's philosophy is concerned not with the ethical per se, in either its applied or its transcendent forms, but with the source of ethics. Once this source is revealed to be an anarchic interruption of our efforts to think the ethical, Levinas's political claims cannot be read as straightforward ideological positions or principles for political action. They are instead to be understood "prophetically," a position that Harold finds comparable to the communitarian critique of liberalism offered by such writers as Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor. In developing this interpretation, which runs counter to formative influences from the phenomenological tradition, Harold traces Levinas's debt to phenomenological descriptions of such experiences as empathy and playfulness.Prophetic Politicswill highlight the relevance of the phenomenological tradition to contemporary ethical and political thought-a long-standing goal of the series-while also making a significant and original contribution to Levinas scholarship.<br>

Die poststrukturalistischen Theorien legten damit einen weiten Textbegriff zugrunde und sahen jeden Text als intertextuell konstituiert an. Doch dieses Modell findet wenig Anwendung im translatorischen Umfeld (der literarischen Übersetzung), da es keine Ansatzpunkte bzw. Interpretationsmodelle für den literarischen Übersetzer bietet, für den die Analyse und Interpretation des jeweiligen literarischen Textes ein unabdingbares Element des Übersetzungsprozesses bildet.

  Abstract: In this volume in the series Reading the Bible in the 21st Century: Insights, Mitzi J.

Smith shows how questions of race, ethnicity, and the dynamics of “othering" have resulted in new reading of particular texts, and describes challenges that scholarship raises for the future of biblical interpretation.<br>

  Author(s): Boyd Gregory A.<br>
  Abstract: In an epic constructive investigation, The Crucifixion of the Warrior God addresses the tension between Scripture’s violent depictions of God and the non-violent, self-sacrificial God that was supremely revealed on the cross. Over two volumes, author Gregory A. Boyd develops a theological interpretation of Scripture that he labels a “cruciform hermeneutic," and he argues that this cruciform way of reading Scripture reframes its violent divine portraits in a way that subverts their violence and that discloses how they bear witness to the revelation of God’s non-violent love in the crucified Christ.<br>

  Abstract: In contemporary anthropology, much is made of the ways in which meaning is constructed by a culture’s members. The interpretive act by which sense is asserted, such as in the interpretation of art or dreams or language, is a moment m which such constructions of meaning become particularly clear. It seems therefore a particularly vital point at which to observe a culture’s workings.

  Abstract: IN THE LAST CHAPTER I presented evidence that students write more cogently about a text when they respond to another commentator than when they respond directly to the text itself. I argued that when students write poorly (on other subjects as well as literature), the reason is often that they are asked to generate an idea or interpretation in a void rather than to enter a conversation. But given the unfamiliarity of the conversations of the intellectual world, most students need help grasping these conversations and writing them into their texts. If this argument is valid, it follows that

  Book Title: Absorbing Perfections-Kabbalah and Interpretation<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Bloom Harold<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging discussion of Kabbalah-from the mystical trends of medieval Judaism to modern Hasidism-one of the world's foremost scholars considers different visions of the nature of the sacred text and of the methods to interpret it. Moshe Idel takes as a starting point the fact that the postbiblical Jewish world lost its geographical center with the destruction of the temple and so was left with a textual center, the Holy Book. Idel argues that a text-oriented religion produced language-centered forms of mysticism.Against this background, the author demonstrates how various Jewish mystics amplified the content of the Scriptures so as to include everything: the world, or God, for example. Thus the text becomes a major realm for contemplation, and the interpretation of the text frequently becomes an encounter with the deepest realms of reality. Idel delineates the particular hermeneutics belonging to Jewish mysticism, investigates the progressive filling of the text with secrets and hidden levels of meaning, and considers in detail the various interpretive strategies needed to decodify the arcane dimensions of the text.<br>

The emergence of forms of Kabbalah that display a vigorous symbolic mode of interpretation, and the composition of a book that is informed by a symbolic code and becomes canonical, are therefore sharp departures from the royal road of expression and interpretation dominant, previously, in those forms of religious literature.¹ Interestingly, even after the ascent of this figurative mode in some Kabbalistic writings, symbolic<br>

  Book Title: Freedom and Time-A Theory of Constitutional Self-Government<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): RUBENFELD JED<br>
  Abstract: Should we try to "live in the present"? Such is the imperative of modernity, Jed Rubenfeld writes in this important and original work of political theory. Since Jefferson proclaimed that "the earth belongs to the living"-since Freud announced that mental health requires people to "get free of their past"-since Nietzsche declared that the happy man is the man who "leaps" into "the moment-modernity has directed its inhabitants to live in the present, as if there alone could they find happiness, authenticity, and above all freedom.But this imperative, Rubenfeld argues, rests on a profoundly inadequate, deforming picture of the relationship between freedom and time. Instead, Rubenfeld suggests, human freedom-human being itself--necessarily extends into both past and future; self-government consists of giving our lives meaning and purpose over time. From this conception of self-government, Rubenfeld derives a new theory of constitutional law's place in democracy. Democracy, he writes, is not a matter of governance by the present "will of the people"; it is a matter of a nation's laying down and living up to enduring political and legal commitments. Constitutionalism is not counter to democracy, as many believe, or a pre-condition of democracy; it is or should be democracy itself--over time. On this basis, Rubenfeld offers a new understanding of constitutional interpretation and of the fundamental right of privacy.<br>

  Abstract: One hundred years after the publication of
      The Interpretation of Dreams,Freud remains the most frequently cited author of our culture-and one of the most controversial. To some he is the presiding genius of modernity, to others the author of its symptomatic illnesses. The current position of psychoanalysis is very much at issue. Is it still valid as a theory of the mind? Have its therapeutic applications been rendered obsolete by drugs? Why does it still figure in debates about sexual identity, despite its rejection by many feminists? How does it contribute to cultural analysis?This book offers a new assessment of the status of psychoanalysis as a discipline and a discourse in contemporary culture. It brings together an exceptional group of theorists and practitioners, such partisans and critics of Freud as Frederic Crews, Judith Butler, Leo Bersani, Juliet Mitchell, Robert Jay Lifton, Richard Wollheim, Jonathan Lear, and others.These contributors, who are active in literature, philosophy, film, history, cultural studies, neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other disciplines, debate how psychoanalysis has enriched-and been enriched by-these fields.<br>

  Book Title: Transmitters and Creators-Chinese Commentators and Commentaries on the Analects<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Asia Center<br>
  Author(s): Makeham John<br>
  Abstract: The Analects (Lunyu) is one of the most influential texts in human history. As a putative record of Confucius’s (551–479 B.C.E.) teachings and a foundational text in scriptural Confucianism, this classic was instrumental in shaping intellectual traditions in China and East Asia until the early twentieth century. But no premodern reader read only the text of the Analects itself. Rather, the Analects was embedded in a web of interpretation that mediated its meaning. Modern interpreters of the Analects only rarely acknowledge this legacy of two thousand years of commentaries. How well do we understand prominent or key commentaries from this tradition? How often do we read such commentaries as we might read the text on which they comment? Many commentaries do more than simply comment on a text. Not only do they shape the reading of the text, but passages of text serve as pretexts for the commentator to develop and expound his own body of thought. This book attempts to redress our neglect of commentaries by analyzing four key works dating from the late second century to the mid-nineteenth century (a period substantially contemporaneous with the rise and decline of scriptural Confucianism): the commentaries of He Yan (ca. 190–249); Huang Kan (488–545); Zhu Xi (1130–1200); and Liu Baonan (1791–1855) and Liu Gongmian (1821–1880).<br>

  Abstract: In this comprehensive study of the rhetoric, narrative patterns, and intellectual content of the Zuozhuan and Guoyu, David Schaberg reads these two collections of historical anecdotes as traces of a historiographical practice that flourished around the fourth century BCE among the followers of Confucius. He contends that the coherent view of early China found in these texts is an effect of their origins and the habits of reading they impose. Rather than being totally accurate accounts, they represent the efforts of a group of officials and ministers to argue for a moralizing interpretation of the events of early Chinese history and for their own value as skilled interpreters of events and advisers to the rulers of the day.<br>

The decisions made by archivists on what should and should not be included in a collection are the first step in the process of interpreting historical facts; all the succeeding choices the historian makes depend on the composition and structure of the archive. As a consequence, the archive is not only the ‘starting point’ of historical research, it is also part of the historiographical discourse.¹ Furthermore, the act of collecting documents and objects always implies a change in<br>

But what in our divided and fragmented world governs our visions or perceptions of the past? We insist on the need for self-reflection, on the analysis of our principles, but these are inevitably governed and constricted by the perceptions we have received and constructed.<br>

  Abstract: Narratological concepts, such as focalization, perspective, implied author, the distinction between story and discourse, and even homo- and heterodiegetic narration, today belong to the toolkit of scholars of literature, including those who do not consider themselves narratologists. Since literary analysis almost always also encompasses formal aspects of works, narratological concepts concerning the structure and forms of a narrative are taken by many as a ‘natural’ choice. Narratologists did not originally see their work as ‘a handmaiden to interpretation’; their theoretically-based taxonomic description of narrative was separated from interpretation, which always also has to do with the content of the narrative<br>

  Book Title: Encounter with the Plumed Serpent-Drama and Power in the Heart of Mesoamerica<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): Jiménez Gabina Aurora Pérez<br>
  Abstract: The Mixtec, or the people of Savi ("Nation of the Rain God"), one of the major civilizations of ancient Mesoamerica, made their home in the highlands of Oaxaca, where they resisted both Aztec military expansion and the Spanish conquest. This book presents and interprets the sacred histories narrated in the Mixtec codices, the largest surviving collection of pre-Columbian manuscripts in existence. In these screenfold books, ancient painter-historians chronicled the politics of the Mixtec from approximately a.d. 900 to 1521, portraying the royal families, rituals, wars, alliances, and ideology of the times. By analyzing and cross-referencing the codices, which have been fragmented and dispersed in far-flung archives, the authors attempt to reconstruct Mixtec history. Adding useful interpretation and commentary, Jansen and Perez Jimenez synthesize the large body of surviving documents into the first unified narrative of Mixtec sacred history.<br>

The volume takes into account global realities such as 9/11 and the opening of the Cypriot Green Line and explores the different ways in which Geertz’s anthropology has shaped the pedagogy of their disciplines and enabled discussions among them. Focusing on place and time, locations and temporalities, the essays in this volume interrogate the fixity of interpretation and open new spaces of inquiry. The volume addresses a wide audience from the humanities and the social sciences—anyone interested in the development of a new humanism that will relocate the human as a subject of social action.<br>

This criticism addresses the apparent relativization of Christology as the dogmatic normative core of all Christian theology.

  Book Title: The Translator’s Doubts-Vladimir Nabokov and the Ambiguity of Translation<br>
  Publisher: Academic Studies Press<br>
  Author(s): TRUBIKHINA JULIA<br>
  Abstract: Using Vladimir Nabokov as its “case study," this volume approaches translation as a crucial avenue into literary history and theory, philosophy and interpretation. It attempts to bring together issues in translation and the shift in Nabokov studies from its earlier emphasis on the “metaliterary" to the more recent “metaphysical" approach. Addressing specific texts (both literary and cinematic), the book investigates Nabokov’s deeply ambivalent relationship to translation as a hermeneutic oscillation on his part between the relative stability of meaning, which expresses itself philosophically as a faith in the beyond, and deep metaphysical uncertainty. While Nabokov’s practice of translation changed profoundly over the course of his career, his adherence to the Romantic notion of a “true" but ultimately elusive metaphysical language remained paradoxically constant.<br>

It is hard to separate Vladimir Nabokov from the act of translation, in all senses of the word—ranging from “moving across” geographical borders and cultural and linguistic boundaries to the transposing of the split between “here” and “there” and “then” and “now” (the essential elements of exile, components of every émigré experience) onto a metaphysical plane sometimes suggested<br>

  Book Title: Sonata Fragments-Romantic Narratives in Chopin, Schumann, and Brahms<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Davis Andrew<br>
  Abstract: In
      Sonata Fragments, Andrew Davis argues that the Romantic sonata is firmly rooted, both formally and expressively, in its Classical forebears, using Classical conventions in order to convey a broad constellation of Romantic aesthetic values. This claim runs contrary to conventional theories of the Romantic sonata that place this nineteenth-century musical form squarely outside inherited Classical sonata procedures. Building on Sonata Theory, Davis examines moments of fracture and fragmentation that disrupt the cohesive and linear temporality in piano sonatas by Chopin, Brahms, and Schumann. These disruptions in the sonata form are a narrative technique that signify temporal shifts during which we move from the outer action to the inner thoughts of a musical agent, or we move from the story as it unfolds to a flashback or flash-forward. Through an interpretation of Romantic sonatas as temporally multi-dimensional works in which portions of the music in any given piece can lie inside or outside of what Sonata Theory would define as the sonata-space proper, Davis reads into these ruptures a narrative of expressive features that mark these sonatas as uniquely Romantic.<br>

  Author(s): ALMÉN BYRON<br>
  Abstract: Byron Almén proposes an original synthesis of approaches to musical narrative from literary criticism, semiotics, historiography, musicology, and music theory, resulting in a significant critical reorientation of the field. This volume includes an extensive survey of traditional approaches to musical narrative illustrated by a wide variety of musical examples that highlight the range and applicability of the theoretical apparatus. Almén provides a careful delineation of the essential elements and preconditions of musical narrative organization, an eclectic analytical model applicable to a wide range of musical styles and repertoires, a classification scheme of narrative types and subtypes reflecting conceptually distinct narrative strategies, a wide array of interpretive categories, and a sensitivity to the dependence of narrative interpretation on the cultural milieu of the work, its various audiences, and the analyst.
      A Theory of Musical Narrativeprovides both an excellent introduction to an increasingly important conceptual domain and a complex reassessment of its possibilities and characteristics.<br>

In the Borough of Southwark, not far from Shakespeare's Globe, is a pilgrimage site for self-identified misfits, nonconformists, and contemporary sex workers who leave memorials to the outcast dead. Ceremonies combining raucous humor and eclectic spirituality are led by a local playwright, John Constable, also known as John Crow. His interpretation of the history of the site has struck a chord with many who feel alienated in present-day London. Sondra L. Hausner offers a nuanced ethnography of Crossbones that tacks between past and present to look at the historical practices of sex work, the relation of the Church to these professions, and their representation in the present. She draws on anthropological approaches to ritual and time to understand the forms of spiritual healing conveyed by the Crossbones rites. She shows that ritual is a way of creating the present by mobilizing the stories of the past for contemporary purposes.<br>

While many support hierarchical readings that subordinate Eve to Adam, others offer a more ambiguous, or at least less negative, interpretation of the first woman/Eve.<br>

  Author(s) Verstraeten Johan<br>
  Abstract: The term “patristic social ethics” may convey the impression that the Church Fathers—already an immensely varied group of individuals covering at least half a millennium—shared a number of systematic views on social issues. It seems to suggest that they held a set of norms and rules, which can be reconstructed through the careful reading of their sermons, letters, and dogmatic works. On such an understanding, patristic teaching on property, poverty, or usury, takes the form of a coherent, discrete body of doctrines. Such an approach might work well for theological topics, for example, the interpretation of the Trinity<br>

The history of liturgy moves at a glacial pace, with changes of rituals or garments recorded only seldom and subtly over the centuries. Like episcopal law, liturgy also provided a deep connection of the Frankish bishops to the ancient past of the church. Liturgy involved bishops in a unique theatre of rituals and gestures repeated over many centuries. As in episcopal law, emphasis was laid on the duplication of antiquity.<br>

  Book Title: Time in the Philosophy of Gabriel Marcel-  Publisher: Modern Humanities Research Association<br>
  Author(s): Tattam Helen<br>
  Abstract: Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) stands outside the traditional canon of twentieth-century French philosophers. Where he is not simply forgotten or overlooked, he is dismissed as a ‘relentlessly unsystematic’ thinker, or, following Jean-Paul Sartre’s lead, labelled a ‘Christian existentialist’ — a label that avoids consideration of Marcel’s work on its own terms. How is one to appreciate Marcel’s contribution, especially when his oeuvre appears to be at odds with philosophical convention? Helen Tattam proposes a range of readings, as opposed to one single interpretation: a series of departures or explorations that bring Marcel’s work into contact with critical partners such as Henri Bergson, Paul Ricoeur and Emmanuel Lévinas and other insights into a host of twentieth-century philosophical shifts concerning time, the subject, the other, ethics, and religion.<br>

If Augustine’s concern with time is philosophical,¹ however, it is also linked to his religious outlook — just as, this chapter will suggest, might be argued for Marcel. However, this theological aspect is rather neglected in Ricœur’s interpretation of Augustine. For Ricœur, God’s eternity in Book XI of the

  Abstract: Hermeneutical theology is a distinct approach to theology. Hermeneutics itself is the science of interpretation.¹ Since Christianity is a textually based religion shaped by and oriented around a particular set of symbols, Christian theology needs to reinterpret its significant doctrines, texts,² and symbols for each new generation and within each new culture in which it emerges. Such interpretation is necessary for several reasons: on anthropological grounds, in light of the principle of analogy, because of the nature of foundational documents themselves, and, finally, in light of the hermeneutics of suspicion.³<br>

  Book Title: The Sexual Person-Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Lawler Michael G.<br>
  Abstract: Two principles capture the essence of the official Catholic position on the morality of sexuality: first, that any human genital act must occur within the framework of heterosexual marriage; second, each and every marriage act must remain open to the transmission of life. In this comprehensive overview of Catholicism and sexuality, theologians Todd A. Salzman and Michael G. Lawler examine and challenge these principles. Remaining firmly within the Catholic tradition, they contend that the church is being inconsistent in its teaching by adopting a dynamic, historically conscious anthropology and worldview on social ethics and the interpretation of scripture while adopting a static, classicist anthropology and worldview on sexual ethics. While some documents from Vatican II, like
      Gaudium et spes("the marital act promotes self-giving by which spouses enrich each other"), gave hope for a renewed understanding of sexuality, the church has not carried out the full implications of this approach. In short, say Salzman and Lawler: emphasize relationships, not acts, and recognize Christianity's historically and culturally conditioned understanding of human sexuality.The Sexual Persondraws historically, methodologically, and anthropologically from the best of Catholic tradition and provides a context for current theological debates between traditionalists and revisionists regarding marriage, cohabitation, homosexuality, reproductive technologies, and what it means to be human. This daring and potentially revolutionary book will be sure to provoke constructive dialogue among theologians, and between theologians and the Magisterium.<br>

This is not particularly controversial, but neither is it obvious what this implies. Proper contextualization of interpretations does not require a lengthy account of “the context” that would duplicate or mimic specialist histories; it is rather a matter of perceptive interpretation of particular points in each thinker,<br>

  Author(s): WEINSHEIMER JOEL<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging historical introduction to philosophical hermeneutics, Jean Grondin discusses the major figures from Philo to Habermas, analyzes conflicts between various interpretive schools, and provides a persuasive critique of Gadamer's view of hermeneutic history, though in other ways Gadamer's
      Truth and Methodserves as a model for Grondin's approach.Grondin begins with brief overviews of the pre-nineteenth-century thinkers Philo, Origen, Augustine, Luther, Flacius, Dannhauer, Chladenius, Meier, Rambach, Ast, and Schlegel. Next he provides more extensive treatments of such major nineteenth-century figures as Schleiermacher, Böckh, Droysen, and Dilthey. There are full chapters devoted to Heidegger and Gadamer as well as shorter discussions of Betti, Habermas, and Derrida. Because he is the first to pay close attention to pre-Romantic figures, Grondin is able to show that the history of hermeneutics cannot be viewed as a gradual, steady progression in the direction of complete universalization. His book makes it clear that even in the early period, hermeneutic thinkers acknowledged a universal aspect in interpretation-that long before Schleiermacher, hermeneutics was philosophical and not merely practical. In revising and correcting the standard account, Grondin's book is not merely introductory but revisionary, suitable for beginners as well as advanced students in the field.<br>

  Book Title: Interpreting Interpretation-The Limits of Hermeneutic Psychoanalysis<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Saks Elyn R.<br>
  Abstract: Psychoanalytic interpretation, according to the hermeneutic view, is concerned with meaning rather than facts or causes. In this provocative book, Elyn R. Saks focuses closely on what hermeneutic psychoanalysis is and how the approaches of hermeneutic psychoanalysts differ. She finds that although these psychoanalysts use the same words, concepts, images, and analogies, they hold to at least five different positions on the truth of psychoanalytic interpretations. Saks locates within these five models the thought of such prominent analysts as Roy Schafer, Donald Spence, and George Klein. Then, approaching each model from the patient's point of view, the author reaches important conclusions about treatments that patients not only will-but should-reject.If patients understood the true nature of the various models of hermeneutic psychoanalysis, Saks argues, they would spurn the story model, which asks patients to believe interpretations that do not purport to be true; that is, the psychoanalyst simply tells stories that give meaning to patients' lives, the truth of which is not considered relevant. And patients would question the metaphor and the interpretations-as-literary-criticism models, which propose views of psychoanalysis that may be unsatisfying. In addition to discussing which hermeneutic models of treatment are plausible, Saks discusses the nature of metaphorical truth. She arrives at some penetrating insights into the theory of psychoanalysis itself.<br>

  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KELLEY DONALD R.<br>
  Abstract: In this book, one of the world's leading intellectual historians offers a critical survey of Western historical thought and writing from the pre-classical era to the late eighteenth century. Donald R. Kelley focuses on persistent themes and methodology, including questions of myth, national origins, chronology, language, literary forms, rhetoric, translation, historical method and criticism, theory and practice of interpretation, cultural studies, philosophy of history, and "historicism."Kelley begins by analyzing the dual tradition established by the foundational works of Greek historiography-Herodotus's broad cultural and antiquarian inquiry and the contrasting model of Thucydides' contemporary political and analytical narrative. He then examines the many variations on and departures from these themes produced in writings from Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian antiquity, in medieval chronicles, in national histories and revisions of history during the Renaissance and Reformation, and in the rise of erudite and enlightened history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Throughout, Kelley discusses how later historians viewed their predecessors, including both supporters and detractors of the authors in question.The book, which is a companion volume to Kelley's highly praised anthology
      Versions of History from Antiquity to the Enlightenment,will be a valuable resource for scholars and students interested in interpretations of the past.<br>

But the semiotic critic situates the text somewhat differently, privileges different dimensions of the text, and uses a critical methodology adpated to the semiotic enterprise. Most interpretive methods privilege the “meaning” of the text. Hermeneutic critics seek authorial or intentional meaning; the New Critics seek the ambiguities of “textual” meaning; the “reader response” critics allow readers to make meaning.

  Abstract: In the book Frei proposes classifying theologians according to whether they see Christian theology primarily as an academic discipline or as an internal activity of Christian communities. He describes fie different variations of these views. the first, represented by Immanuel Kant and Gordon represented, regards theology as a philosophical discipline within the academy. The second, represented by theologians as diverse as represented represented, David Tracy, and Carl Henry, correlates specifically Christian with general cultural structures of meaning. The third type, represetned by represented represented and Paul represented, occupies the middle of the spectrum. The fourth type, represetned by Karl Barth, emphasizes the internal descriptive task of theology but remains open to ad hoc correlations with concerns of the wider culture. the fifth, which includes D. Z. Phillips and other Wittgensteinian fideists, opts for pure self-description though this group defends its position with philosophical arguments that, oddly enough connect it with the other end of the spectrum. Frei argues in favor of the third and fourth options. In his view, theologians like Schleiermacher and, even more, Barth, although often seen as polar opposites, enable theology to remain most faithful to the priority of the ecumenically attested literal sense in biblical interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: How does the kind of layout we have prepared for ourselves influence one’s choice or choices in regard to biblical interpretation? A lot depends on what one wishes to do. It is not the case, of course, that one of these types, even if one finds a pure representative for it, will guide us to a right interpretation of the Bible. For let us assume that the notion of a right interpretation of the Bible is itself not meaningless, but it is eschatological. The Christian community is gathered in

  Abstract: In this chapter I shall attempt to show how currents in descriptive philosophy of religion can be combined and adapted to create a form of philosophical exegesis that can be employed fruitfully as a new type of biblical criticism. In doing so I hope to offer what could become an independent and officially recognized form of textual interpretation that supplements already extant linguistic, historical, literary, and social-scientific perspectives. Bringing together insights from previous chapters, the new interpretative methodology aims to be both philosophical and historical and, because it has as its focus the clarification of meaning only, to bring to<br>

  Book Title: The Politics of Pessimism in Ecclesiastes-  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Sneed Mark R.<br>
  Abstract: Scholars attempt to resolve the problem of the book of Ecclesiastes’ heterodox character in one of two ways, either explaining away the book’s disturbing qualities or radicalizing and championing it as a precursor of modern existentialism. This volume offers an interpretation of Ecclesiastes that both acknowledges the unorthodox nature of Qoheleth’s words and accounts for its acceptance among the canonical books of the Hebrew Bible. It argues that, instead of being the most secular and modern of biblical books, Ecclesiastes is perhaps one of the most religious and primitive. Bringing a Weberian approach to Ecclesiastes, it represents a paradigm of the application of a social-science methodology.<br>

Marxist approaches will be discussed first. As will be seen, almost all biblical scholars who have taken a Marxist approach to Qohelet are rather “vulgar,” seeing his worldview as merely a direct reflection of his social position, the superstructure merely mirroring the infrastructure.<br>

  Abstract: In the mid 1990s, twenty years after the first rumblings of discursive unease and the initial calls for disciplinary redirection, I undertook the task of mapping the given results of such concerns and moves regarding the conceptualization and exercise of biblical criticism by way of paradigms or umbrella models of interpretation. This was an attempt to outline and explain the critical present, to survey the lay of the land, in terms of its past trajectory. Such mapping, in retrospect, followed a twofold impulse of the times.

  Abstract: How does the patristic-medieval tradition of biblical interpretation flow from and shape a Christological understanding of ecclesial authority? In seeking to answer this question, this essay will focus upon exegesis of Jesus’ depiction of himself in John’s Gospel as the “good shepherd” (Jn 10:1–18). I will proceed in three steps. First, I will summarize two recent attempts by biblical exegetes, one Catholic and one Protestant, to expose the meaning of John 10:1–18. Second, I will survey Augustine’s reading of this passage in his commentary on John’s Gospel. Third, I will examine in detail Aquinas’s exegesis of this passage,<br>

  Abstract: Despite many differences in detail, Judaism and Islam have much in common in their reliance on law as an organizing framework. Both legal systems turn to canonical textual sources (both scriptural and nonscriptural), as well as the interpretation of these texts, for the foundations of practice. Questions of legal method animated much early debate within each tradition; in Islamic law, distinctive legal schools persist to this day, which maintain such debate. Over time, narrative codes emerged in each tradition that established communal norms; these codes negotiated and at times vindicated local customary practice.

As with any theory of literary creation or interpretation, however, Avicenna’s hermeneutics must be taken with a grain of salt. Authorial theories of composition and reading are indeed relevant, but they should not be accepted so literally that they overly determine our understanding of the workings of the texts themselves.

  Book Title: Sensuous Scholarship-  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): STOLLER PAUL<br>
  Abstract: Among the Songhay of Mali and Niger, who consider the stomach the seat of personality, learning is understood not in terms of mental activity but in bodily terms. Songhay bards study history by "eating the words of the ancestors," and sorcerers learn their art by ingesting particular substances, by testing their flesh with knives, by mastering pain and illness. In
      Sensuous ScholarshipPaul Stoller challenges contemporary social theorists and cultural critics who-using the notion of embodiment to critique Eurocentric and phallocentric predispositions in scholarly thought-consider the body primarily as a text that can be read and analyzed. Stoller argues that this attitude is in itself Eurocentric and is particularly inappropriate for anthropologists, who often work in societies in which the notion of text, and textual interpretation, is foreign. ThroughoutSensuous ScholarshipStoller argues for the importance of understanding the "sensuous epistemologies" of many non-Western societies so that we can better understand the societies themselves and what their epistemologies have to teach us about human experience in general.<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Abstract: This collection of critical essays is the first to track down the metaphysical detective story, a genre of largely twentieth-century experimental fiction with a flamboyant yet decidedly complex relationship to the detective story, and a kinship to modernist and postmodernist fiction in general. The metaphysical detective story is distinguished, moreover, by the profound questions that it raises about narrative, interpretation, subjectivity, the nature of reality, and the limits of knowledge. For these reasons, the aims of our volume are different from—and indeed, go far beyond—those of other books that have been published on detective fiction, pop culture, postmodernist<br>

Just so, if oral traditions are told faithfully and respectfully, they will return to benefit future generations. The contributors to this volume are concerned with the interpretation and representation of oral narrative and how it is shaped by its audience and the time, place, and cultural context of the narration. Thus, oral traditions are understood as a series of dialogues between tradition bearers and their listeners, including those who record, write, and interpret.<br>

  Book Title: Moral Evil-  Publisher: Georgetown University Press<br>
  Author(s): Flescher Andrew Michael<br>
  Abstract: The idea of moral evil has always held a special place in philosophy and theology because the existence of evil has implications for the dignity of the human and the limits of human action. Andrew M. Flescher proposes four interpretations of evil, drawing on philosophical and theological sources and using them to trace through history the moral traditions that are associated with them.The first model, evil as the presence of badness, offers a traditional dualistic model represented by Manicheanism. The second, evil leading to goodness through suffering, presents a theological interpretation known as theodicy. Absence of badness-that is, evil as a social construction-is the third model. The fourth, evil as the absence of goodness, describes when evil exists in lieu of the good-the "privation" thesis staked out nearly two millennia ago by Christian theologian St. Augustine. Flescher extends this fourth model-evil as privation-into a fifth, which incorporates a virtue ethic. Drawing original connections between Augustine and Aristotle, Flescher's fifth model emphasizes the formation of altruistic habits that can lead us to better moral choices throughout our lives.Flescher eschews the temptation to think of human agents who commit evil as outside the norm of human experience. Instead, through the honing of moral skills and the practice of attending to the needs of others to a greater degree than we currently do, Flescher offers a plausible and hopeful approach to the reality of moral evil.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpnfx">A New Republic of Letters</a><br>
  Abstract: Why does textual scholarship matter? Most students of literature and culture who worked in the twentieth century would have thought that a highly specialized question, and many still do. But a hundred years ago the question would hardly have been posed at all. Until the early decades of the twentieth century what we now call literary and cultural studies was called philology, and all its interpretive procedures were clearly understood to be grounded in textual scholarship. But twentieth-century textual studies shifted their center from philology to hermeneutics, that subset of philological inquiry focused on the specifically literary interpretation of culture.<br>

  Book Title: Making Transcendents-Ascetics and Social Memory in Early Medieval China<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Campany Robert Ford<br>
  Abstract: By the middle of the third century B.C.E. in China there were individuals who sought to become transcendents (xian)—deathless, godlike beings endowed with supernormal powers. This quest for transcendence became a major form of religious expression and helped lay the foundation on which the first Daoist religion was built. Both xian and those who aspired to this exalted status in the centuries leading up to 350 C.E. have traditionally been portrayed as secretive and hermit-like figures. This groundbreaking study offers a very different view of xian-seekers in late classical and early medieval China. It suggests that transcendence did not involve a withdrawal from society but rather should be seen as a religious role situated among other social roles and conceived in contrast to them. Robert Campany argues that the much-discussed secrecy surrounding ascetic disciplines was actually one important way in which practitioners presented themselves to others. He contends, moreover, that many adepts were not socially isolated at all but were much sought after for their power to heal the sick, divine the future, and narrate their exotic experiences.

  Abstract: The Heian period has often been characterized as a golden age of Japanese religious culture, one in which the Buddhist literature, painting, sculpture, and architecture produced at court are considered to have reached unprecedented heights. It is thus all the more surprising that in this time of cultural florescence many Buddhists, monastics and aristocrats alike, understood themselves to be living in an age of decay. According to their interpretation of Buddhist chronologies, the eleventh century marked the beginning of the end: the onset of

  Abstract: IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES, I would like to outline the basic features of Marxist historical mythology, linking it with the Western religious and philosophical concern with human salvation. My core argument is that the attempt to provide scientific principles of historical analysis and to break away from the messianic interpretation of history sponsored by the Church was in fact in many ways unsuccessful: underneath the seemingly new Marxist methodology were concealed older concerns with historical time and redemption. Marxists would doubtless have renounced notions such as good, evil, messiah, and salvation as baseless religious superstitions that had nothing to do<br>

  Book Title: Interpretation-Ways of Thinking about the Sciences and the Arts<br>

  Author(s): Wolters Gereon<br>
  Abstract: The act of interpretation occurs in nearly every area of the arts and sciences. That ubiquity serves as the inspiration for the fourteen essays of this volume, covering many of the domains in which interpretive practices are found. Individual topics include: the general nature of interpretation and its forms; comparing and contrasting interpretation and hermeneutics; culture as interpretation seen through Hegel's aesthetics; interpreting philosophical texts; methodologies for interpreting human action; interpretation in medical practice focusing on manifestations as indicators of disease; the brain and its interpretative, structured, learning and storage processes; interpreting hybrid wines and cognitive preconceptions of novel objects; and the importance of sensory perception as means of interpreting in the case of dry German Rieslings.In an interesting turn, Nicholas Rescher writes on the interpretation of philosophical texts. Then Catherine Wilson and Andreas Blank explicate and critique Rescher's theories through analysis of the mill passage from Leibniz's

The following pages propose to depart from the oversimplistic identification of eugenics, as political theory, with racism or ultraconservatism and to offer instead two alternative modes of interpretation.¹ On the one hand, eugenics will be portrayed as an exploratory avenue of the social reformist tendencies of early-twentieth-century British political thought.

  Abstract: The traditional categories through which early Christian exegesis is often described—“literal,” “typological,” “allegorical”—are less helpful for analyzing “ascetic exegesis” than some scholars might imagine. Contrary to my own expectation, I have discovered that typology and allegory, however much they may dominate other types of patristic interpretation, were underutilized interpretive tools in the church fathers’ production of ascetic meaning from Biblical texts. Other interpretive strategies, to be detailed in chapter 5, particularly intertextual exegesis, proved on the whole far more useful. In some cases figurative interpretation of any sort seemed unnecessary to ascetically inclined exegetes because the unadorned—but<br>

The censorship figures in the formal conclusion of the book, with its affirmation of “the two psychical systems, the censorship upon the passage from one of them to the other” (607). Freudian censorship is very much the invention of

What is the relevance ofZarathustrafor Nietzsche’s later work? One might argue that the ecstatic poetry of Nietzsche’s enigmatic “gift” is actually a parody of mystical affirmations, or an ironic warning against overexuberant hopes and loves.

Our discussion of genre suggested that to read a poem as lyric is to read it as creating a reciprocal relation between mind and world. Such reflections do not by themselves suffice to ground a hermeneutic theory or a program of interpretation. In one sense, the model is hostile to anything that resembles a program, for we have insisted that interpretation is the making-explicit of what is already understood.

Readings differ depending on the kind of novel being read and the reader’s purpose, interests, and ideology. By opening the interpretive space between reader and text to include both text interpretation and self-interpretation, the frames of reference that come into play are multiplied.

  Abstract: In his renowned study of nationalism, Benedict Anderson begins by admitting that the subject matter of his book is notoriously hard to define. His interpretation is that a nation is

However, whereas Ernest Gellner said of nationalism that it is able to invent nations even where they do not exist, Anderson (1983, 6) asserts that the process of nation-creating is not so much one of false fabrication as it is one of active creation: in a sense there are no “true” communities that can be juxtaposed to “false,” or invented,<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

  Abstract: HE RANGE of works typed as “commentary” may vary widely. By a narrow definition, a commentary may refer only to a running gloss on a text generally recognized as classical or scriptural.¹ A wider conception would identify much of the literature of the postclassical, or “silver,” age in several civilizations or traditions as forms of commentary (or, in some cases, hidden commentary) on the classics. Barry Holtz, for example, has remarked that almost all of Jewish literature, from the legal codes of the Middle Ages to the Hasidic homilies of the nineteenth century, “presents itself as nothing more than interpretation,<br>

Instead of the expected denouement there is an impossible, or paradoxical, outcome. Only a critical reading, such as the one performed in “

  Abstract: Humanistic scholarship—especially the close reading and interpretation of texts—has always been an important part of our cultural inheritance, particularly since the eighteenth-century flowering of biblical philology and hermeneutics. The twentieth century has witnessed not only a redefinition of the humanities and a new disciplinary organization of teaching and research in this and other areas, but also the successive development of a number of new approaches to the interpretation of texts. In the most recent decades, some would say that certain components of the humanities have changed more than any other area of study at the universities. One clear<br>

The verifying structure can be briefly summarized. Beginning with a distinction between flesh and spirit, it was deduced, ultimately, from Plato, and, in various guises, it posited an ironic tension between archetype and image, on the participation of the image in the archetype, and on the actual presence of the archetype in the image of likeness.

Todorov’s 1966 distinction between the “sense” of an element, “its capacity to enter into correlation with other elements of the same work and with the work as a whole,” and the “interpretation” of an element, its inclusion “in a system which is not that of the work but that of the critic,”¹ seems to me now to be much more problematic than it did when it was initially proposed.

  Abstract: Exploring Polanyi's lesser-known works as well as The Great Transformation, Baum provides a more complete and nuanced understanding of Polanyi's thought. He examines Polanyi's interpretation of modern economic and social history, clarifies the ethical presuppositions present in Polanyi's work, and addresses how Polanyi's understanding of the relation between ethics and economics touches on many issues relevant to the contemporary debate about the world's economic future. Baum argues that we should look to Polanyi's understanding of modern capitalism to reinstate the social discourse and, in political practice, the principles of reciprocity and solidarity. He points to examples, both in Canada and abroad, of attempts to formulate alternative models of economic development and to create new forms of institutional and cultural intervention.<br>

  Abstract: The title, Figuring Grief, refers to the narrative process whereby mourning is depicted. In her textual analysis, Smythe explores various connections between representation and consolation. Drawing on genre and narratological theory, she outlines the development of the "fiction-elegy" as a sub-genre and suggests that the modernist writings of Woolf and Joyce are paradigmatic examples of the form. She then uses these paradigms as suggestive "reading models" for the interpretation of works by Gallant, Munro, and other contemporary fiction-elegists. Figuring Grief offers new readings of specific works and suggests that new ways of reading are both demanded and rewarded by a poetics of elegy.<br>

On the other hand, the Heideggerian efforts on behalf of ontology merged into the universe of hermeneutic interpretation.

  Book Title: By Bread Alone-The Bible through the Eyes of the Hungry<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Pilarski Ahida Calderón<br>
  Abstract: Important ecclesiastical documents have stressed the urgency of world hunger and put in the foreground its natural and historical causes, from famine to global austerity measures and welfare. These concerns have not always affected the way the biblical texts themselves have been read, however. Here, inspired by calls, from Dorothee Sölle and Kathleen O Connor, biblical scholars apply a "hermeneutics of hunger" to the Bible, taking readings of texts from the Old and New Testaments alike on the premise that human hunger and want are urgent concerns that rightly shape the work of interpretation. Too often, however, as the authors show, biblical texts—like Jesus' well-known words that humans do not live "by bread alone"—have been used to marginalize such concerns within religious communities. Their essays here explore the dynamics of hunger and its causation in ancient Israel and the Greco-Roman world and challenge readers to take seriously the centrality of hunger concerns in the Bible.<br>

  Book Title: Postmodernity and Univocity-A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Horan Daniel P.<br>
  Abstract: Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank’s Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical point—the work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank’s account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy’s use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, OFM, offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy’s idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus’s work for contemporary theology.<br>

  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric Culture theory has its roots in a long history, and in what follows I present some of the ideas that scholars—mainly rhetoricians, but also some philosophers—have developed over the centuries in order to grasp the difficult and complex relationship between rhetoric, culture, and humanity. Throughout, I have given priority to the voices of the precursors of Rhetoric Culture theory and have kept my own interpretation and comments to a minimum. At the end, I recall the work of scholars who were among the first to empirically study the constitutive role of rhetoric in non-European cultures.<br>

  Book Title: Medieval Manuscripts in Transition-Tradition and Creative Recycling<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): VERBEKE Werner<br>
  Abstract: Manuscripts constitute the source material par excellence for diverse academic disciplines. Art historians, philologists, historians, theologians, philosophers, book historians and even jurists encounter one another around the codex. The fact that such an encounter can be extremely fertile was demonstrated, during an international congress in Brussels on November 5-9, 2002. A record of the discussions can be found in this volume of the Mediaevalia Lovaniensia. The editors selected those lectures that focused on the historical, literary-historical, philosophical and theological aspects of the congress theme as opposed to those with an explicit art-historical perspective. The common thread, however, is always the codicological aspect: what can the study of manuscripts contribute to the literary-historical interpretation or the insight into the functioning of a text in its original context. The various contributions testify to a fearless and unrestrained interdisciplinary approach to the material. The subjects broached cover a broad domain: from the development of classical themes to the transmission of lyrical models, from visual material giving evidence of the reception of literary texts to the artes-literature used as a vehicle for a love story.<br>

  Abstract: In 1905, Freud wrote
                  Three Essays on the Theory of SexualityandJokes and their Relation to the Unconscious. In both of these works, the concept of ‘fore-pleasure’ plays a central and structuring role, but only inJokesis it thoroughly analyzed. Freud’s theory of sexuality, therefore, can only be understood when it is confronted with his theory of jokes. Surprisingly, such a simultaneous reading ofJokesandThree Essaysleads us very far away from the classical interpretation of Freud’s theory of sexuality and especially from his later theory centred on the Oedipus complex. First, we will confront Freud’s<br>

  Abstract: The jurisprudential movements of the 1980s deepened and advanced a process of crisis and transition in modern jurisprudence. The most striking facet of this transformation has been the success of new forms of jurisprudential discourse or “law talk” in penetrating, subverting, and decentering the conventional forms of legal discourse. The proliferation of different jurisprudential discourses has erased the lines between description and advocacy, making it much more difficult for traditionalists to maintain their belief in neutral and objective law. A new understanding of language and interpretation has fired the imagination of legal scholars as they reexamined and critiqued the polar<br>

  Abstract: The thought of Martin Buber (1878–1965) and Franz Rosenzweig (1886–1929) continues to exert a profound influence not only on theologians and philosophers of religion, both Jewish and Christian, but on biblical scholars as well. Their work has been foundational for readers who want not so much to deny as to move beyond historical and philological approaches that obscure biblical literature’s religious and humanistic vitality. Buber and Rosenzweig bring God back into the picture and thus represent a gesture of return to older modes of biblical interpretation.

  Abstract: In its concern for achieving a greater adaptation of Christian doctrines to the contemporary social conditions of Latin America, liberation theology offers divergent views on many social conceptions inherited from the Baroque scholastic tradition. It also takes its inspiration from some Marxist theories concerning social structures and institutional violence, in order to respond to the new manifestations of poverty and oppression which are appearing in Latin American societies. Although Baroque scholasticism, Marxism and liberation theology agree on notions such as the “the finality of history,” the conflicts of interpretation between Christianism and Marxism have compelled the liberation theologians to reformulate<br>

  Abstract: It is perhaps impossible to overestimate the importance of Heidegger’s 1929
                  Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(Heidegger 1997). Through his interpretation of Kant’s First Critique, Heidegger led us to the “hidden art” of the schematism. The core of Heidegger’s interpretation consists in showing that the schematism, lying in the middle between the faculties of the sensibility and the understanding, must be understood as a pure form of auto-affection, and that auto-affection must be understood through the flow of time. Heidegger shows us that the temporal movement of auto-affection contains a difference that cannot be closed off from becoming other.<br>

All these authors unfolded a distinct

The compulsion to repeat is one – perhaps the arch – element making the psychic mechanism mechanical, hence the structural role it plays, and consequently its tolerance of<br>

  Author(s) CAMPBELL TRISHA N.<br>
  Abstract: The move to read big data in the humanities necessitates new forms of reading, new types of interpretation. As we consider macro-level readings of large corpora, visualization is especially helpful. The most effective way to draw meaning from large data sets is through visual forms and patterns. Stephen Ramsay (2011) makes a claim for “the primacy of pattern as the basic hermeneutical function” (xi), meaning the display of visual patterns is a form of interpretation. Rather than “translating” those patterns into textual form, humanists can retain them as evidence of reading. Ramsay maintains that visual forms do indeed constitute a<br>

  Book Title: The Thought of Death and the Memory of War-  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
  Abstract: War lays bare death and our relation to it. And in the wars-or more precisely the memories of war-of the twentieth century, images of the deaths of countless faceless or nameless others eclipse the singularity of each victim's death as well as the end of the world as such that each death signifies. Marc Crépon's The Thought of Death and the Memory of War is a call to resist such images in which death is no longer actual death since it happens to anonymous others, and to seek instead a world in which mourning the other whose mortality we always already share points us toward a cosmopolitics. Crépon pursues this path toward a cosmopolitics of mourning through readings of works by Freud, Heidegger, Sartre, Patocka, Levinas, Derrida, and Ricœur, and others. The movement among these writers, Crépon shows, marks a way through-and against-twentieth-century interpretation to argue that no war, genocide, or neglect of people is possible without suspending how one relates to the death of another human being. A history of a critical strain in contemporary thought, this book is, as Rodolphe Gasché says in the Foreword, "a profound meditation on what constitutes evil and a rigorous and illuminating reflection on death, community, and world." The translation of this work received financial support from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<br>

The standard misreading equates discourse with chatter—endless debates in academic seminars or committees under the “dictatorship of idle flesh” (Sitzfleisch) or, alternatively, harmonious handholding between parties kindly disposed to one another, wishing only well, readily seeking agreement at any cost, and fearful of any possible conflict.

  Abstract: John Caputo is an American philosopher of religion with particular expertise in phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. He is widely known for developing Derrida’s deconstruction into “radical hermeneutics,” a philosophy that subverts any essentialist claims and resists arresting the play of interpretation.¹ This radical hermeneutics is closely aligned with Caputo’s interest in theopoetics, a term that is variously defined by practitioners but that entails the notion that both God and life are best described poetically rather than rationalistically. Theopoetics, at least in Caputo’s radical hermeneutics, and also in Kearney’s anatheism, has connotations of

It is not unreasonable to assert, in this respect, that Heidegger’s reading is the systematic counterpoint to Cohen’s.

  Book Title: After Christianity-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): D’Isanto Luca<br>
  Abstract: When Vattimo was asked by a former teacher if he still believed in God, his reply was, "Well, I believe that I believe." This paradoxical declaration of faith serves as the foundation for a brilliant exposition on Christianity in the new millennium -- an age characterized by a deep uncertainty of opinion -- and a personal account of how Vattimo himself recovered his faith through Nietzsche and Heidegger. He first argues that secularization is in fact the fulfillment of the central Christian message, and prepares us for a new mode of Christianity. He then explains that Nietzsche's thesis concerns only the "moral god" and leaves room for the emergence of "new gods." Third, Vattimo claims that the postmodern condition of fragmentation, anti-Eurocentrism, and postcolonialism can be usefully understood in light of Joachim of Fiore's thesis concerning the "Spiritual Age" of history. Finally, Vattimo argues for the idea of "weak thought." Because philosophy in the postmetaphysical age can only acknowledge that "all is interpretation," that the "real" is always relative and not the hard and fast "truth" we once thought it to be, contemporary thought must recognize itself and its claims as "weak" as opposed to "strong" foundationalist claims of the metaphysical past. Vattimo concludes that these factors make it possible for religion and God to become a serious topic for philosophy again, and that philosophy should now formally engage religion.<br>

How then can the literature of other ages be understood by readers from a present that is culturally so different from the past? Marxism lies at the foundation of Jameson's answer, because it conceives of history as a single collective narrative that links past and present; Marxist literary criticism reveals the unity of that uninterrupted narrative.<br>

It develops new arguments around issues of cognition, interpretation, and language. Digitization, he writes, is inherent in all forms of "writing," from its early beginnings in clay tablets. As digitization increases in print and now electronic culture, there is a corresponding need to counter the fractioning of digitization with the unitive attempts of hermeneutics, particularly hermeneutics that are modeled on oral rather than written paradigms.<br>

  Abstract: The esoteric

Here Heidegger proposes that being takes place as "appropriation." Richard Polt's independent-minded account of theContributionsinterprets appropriation as an event of emergency that demands to be thought in a "future-subjunctive" mode.

  Book Title: Meaning, Truth, and Reference in Historical Representation-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Ankersmit Frank<br>
  Abstract: At the heart of Ankersmit's project is a sharp distinction between interpretation and representation. The historical text, he holds, is first and foremost a representation of some part of the past, not an interpretation. The book's central chapters address the concept of historical representation from the perspectives of reference, truth, and meaning. Ankersmit then goes on to discuss the possible role of experience in the history writing, which leads directly to a consideration of subjectivity and ethics in the historian's practice. Ankersmit concludes with a chapter on political history, which he maintains is the "basis and condition of all other variants of historical writing." Ankersmit's rehabilitation of historicism is a powerfully original and provocative contribution to the debate about the nature of historical writing.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout this book my compass has been the claim put forward in chapter 3 that representation/aesthetics is prior to interpretation/hermeneutics and that it is better to investigate the writing of history from the perspective of representation than from that of interpretation. Interpretation is something one does with texts that already exist, and the phrase “interpreting 
                  the past ” can therefore never be more than a deconstructivist metaphor. So when the linguistic (or, rather, rhetorical) turn in contemporary philosophy of history put a premium on interpretation at the expense of representation, the result was what one might call an “etherealization” of<br>

  Book Title: Textual Cultures: Cultural Texts-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Treharne Elaine<br>
  Abstract: The dynamic fields of the history of the book and the sociology of the text are the areas this volume investigates, bringing together ten specially commissioned essays that between them demonstrate a range of critical and material approaches to medieval, early modern, and digital books and texts. They scrutinize individual medieval manuscripts to illustrate how careful re-reading of evidence permits a more nuanced apprehension of production, and reception across time; analyse metaphor for our understanding of the Byzantine book; examine the materiality of textuality from Beowulf to Pepys and the digital work in the twenty-first century; place manuscripts back into specific historical context; and re-appraise scholarly interpretation of significant periods of manuscript and print production in the later medieval and early modern periods. All of these essays call for a new assessment of the ways in which we read books and texts, making a major contribution to book history, and illustrating how detailed focus on individual cases can yield important new findings.

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

  Author(s) Jones Siân<br>
  Abstract: Public and community archaeologies clearly have their deepest roots in places characterised by structural, societal inequities, and in situations where archaeologists have sought to be inclusive. As such, community archaeology has been generally theorised within a postcolonial, post-processual framework whereby we as scholars and trained professionals question our own position and our right to talk about the past of ‘other people’, often disenfranchised people. As characterised by Gemma Tully, the principal rationale for community archaeology is that ‘better archaeology can be achieved when more diverse voices are involved in the interpretation of the past.’¹ The best of these new inclusive<br>

  Book Title: Love Poetry in the Spanish Golden Age-Eros, Eris and Empire<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): TORRES ISABEL<br>
  Abstract: This work engages with a broader evaluation of early modern poetics that foregrounds the processes rather than the products of thinking. The locus of the study is the Imperial 'home' space, where love poetry meets early modern empire at the inception of a very conflicted national consciousness, and where the vernacular language, Castilian, emerges in the encounter as a strategic site of national and imperial identity. The political is, therefore, a pervasive presence, teased out where relevant in recognition of the poet's sensitivity to the ideologies within which writing comes into being. But the primary commitment of the book is to lyric poetry, and to poets, individually and in their dynamic interconnectedness. Moving beyond a re-evaluation of critical responses to four major poets of the period (Garcilaso de la Vega, Herrera, Góngora and Quevedo), this study disengages respectfully with the substantial body of biographical research that continues to impact upon our understanding of the genre, and renegotiates the Foucauldian concept of the 'epistemic break', often associated with the anti-mimetic impulses of the Baroque. This more flexible model accommodates the multiperspectivism that interrogated Imperial ideology even in the earliest sixteenth-century poetry, and allows for the exploration of new horizons in interpretation.

  Book Title: Juan Goytisolo: The Author as Dissident-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): de Menezes Alison Ribeiro<br>
  Abstract: This monograph offers two new perspectives on Spanish writer, Juan Goytisolo. First, under the themes of authorship and dissidence, it integrates his writing across several genres, providing a rounded assessment of his contribution to cultural debates in Spain since the sixties and arguing that resistance to repressive discourses characterizes his essays and autobiographies as much as his fiction. Second, it revises the prevailing critical interpretation of Goytisolo's fiction by building on four premises: that his novels are less clearly oppositional than prevailing interpretations imply; that, in order to engage with discourses of identity, he employs an idiom which, contrary to his own statements, is not a poststructuralist autonomous world of words; that a textual practice grounded in the recognizable experience of post-Civil War Spain, rather than one which seeks out the realm of pure textuality, is essential to Goytisolo's subversive political intentions; and that the autobiographical element of much of his work constitutes a more complex narrative aesthetic than has been appreciated. The book argues that if Goytisolo's work is interpreted as an ethical engagement with postmodernist theory, rather than as an illustration of it, then certain contradictions for which he has been criticized are seen in a new and valuable light.

The interdisciplinary nature of studies in utopianism (and also in other fields) is becoming more and more accepted, yet the cooperation of the various disciplines in interpretation is not automatic, and their emphases and approaches may differ substantially. As Balázs Trencsényi argues, “historians of political thought try to renegotiate the relationship between history, literary studies and the social sciences, pointing out that the understanding of a political interaction might necessitate the use of a variety of different interpretative techniques and approaches.”¹ Yet interdisciplinarity is not only a technical issue.

The last of these concerns relates closely to a court’s justification for selecting particular segments of the past for the purposes of settling a constitutional problem.

Abstract: Sheleff identifies four areas where his targets fail. Each endorsed a progressive view of social evolution, concluding that coercion would dissipate with social development. Each ignored available evidence contradicting their theories. Each confused the degree to which law shapes culture rather than reflecting its values or structure. Each minimized their ideological interpretation of evidence. Sheleff’s critiques are convincing and thoroughly supported, though sometimes obvious. His discussions are admirably comprehensive; unfortunately, his lengthy analysis of secondary texts often obscures his more provocative ideas.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: Second, we would ask where he assumes it is
         appropriate to speakabout his interpretation. Does he assume that it is somehow his duty to talk about his interpretation of the news or that it is impolite to entertain that kind of conversation, or that talk does not matter? Finally, we would askwhat image of the wider world, and his relation to it, does he have in mind when offering his interpretation of the news? Studies of resistance (Hall1973; Morley1980; Scott1990; Lancaster1988; Willis 1981; Kelley1996) describe long‐standing communities resisting clear, structural domination: Working‐class listeners relating to mainstream news, peasants or slaves relating to official pronunciamentos, or African‐American or working‐class students relating to white, middle‐class teachers. But not all modes of interpreting dominant culture are only either “resisting” or “complying with” elites or powerful institutions; they do not just say “yes” or “no,” but articulate whole new meanings. Second, resistance studies show situations in which members actively perceive oppression as coming directly from an employer, schoolteacher, or political ruler who is immediately present or to whom members can speak directly. But our studies show situations in which the source of oppression is not very clear to members. Oppression may be coming from diffuse sources, in which there is no clearly embodied oppressor against whom to rebel (Hayward2000).<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Language is so ubiquitous in human affairs that we can never talk too much about it. Yet, in the consolidations of the social sciences in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century, language tended to be taken for granted or reduced to the mere expression of already formed thoughts and social processes. The founders of anthropology in the United States, however, thought otherwise, and from the very beginning, by conceiving of language as culture they made it into a crucial resource for understanding how the social and the psychological could come together in human culture. The result was the constitution of linguistics as a subfield of anthropology (a development unparalleled outside of North America). My article is an attempt to reconstruct the history of a thenrevolutionary idea and its realization over the past 100 years by adopting a modified (and operationally more precise) notion of paradigm. I am pleased (or, I should say, pleasantly surprised) to see that my conceptualization of such a history is largely shared by the commentators, who have generously provided additional information and, in some cases, raised some challenging issues. There is much to be learned from Hymess historical footnotes and clarifications, Darnells reflections on her own experience, and van Dijks expansion of the discussion to text analysis in other disciplines. Some commentators have also examined the premises and potential implications of some of my choices, offering alternative perspectives (e.g., allegedly unseen connections) or criticism of my interpretation. I have here organized what I see as the commentators main concerns in terms of four questions: (1) Is paradigm the right choice (Ahearn, CookGumperz and Gumperz), and have I used it correctly (Rumsey)?

Abstract: Doctrine and method, theory and interpretation are not necessarily coordinate. Were such coordination possible, a metacritical stance would be required. By accepting uncritically the presuppositions that lie behind psychoanalytic metapsychology, Juillerat abrogates, in my view, ethnological responsibility, that is, the responsibility to measure in a receptive manner the presuppositions of ones hermeneutic against those of the culture one is studying. Though his attention to ethnographic detail leads Juillerat to refine psychoanalytic doctrine, it confirms the epistemological and hermeneutic assumptions of that doctrine (e.g., notions of the unconscious, id, ego, and superego, drives, repression, and, indeed, psychic space). Yafar myth and ritual as he presents them become allegories of that doctrineallegories, I would argue, of allegories. There would appear to be no escape, were it not for the Yafar voices that sound through Juillerats psychoanalytically predetermined presentations. (He offers us almost no contextualized verbatim texts in these essays, though he does in his monographs.) They remind us that, as LviStrauss demonstrated, myths are readily translated one into another, particularly when they are decontextualized. What is of ethnographic, indeed, psychoanalytic import is howand perhaps whytranslation is arrested and a particular myth (e.g., the Oedipal tale) becomes so authoritative that it has the power of promiscuous reduction. Though fascinated by the range of Yafar cultural expression, Juillerat fails to consider the implications of Yafars refusal to reduce their corpus of mythology and ritual to a single mytha singular ritual.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Hegel’s interpretation of Adam’s privilege in the book of Genesis. There, man has the power to name, to understand, and thus to dominate; but Adam exercises this privilege only upon the animals, never upon God or upon himself. Why do these two escape naming and thus escape the comprehension and, finally, the domination of man? That God would escape is conceived without any difficulty: the Creator is not easily understood, and thus named, by his creature. But why is it that man does not name himself? No interdict is brought to bear here. Nothing more than the second commandment is necessary, which forbids making “for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above” (Exod. 20:4)—anything, therefore, that would claim to represent God through comprehension. But is man, too, “in heaven above”? Most certainly—for this is the decisive paradox—because that which is fitting for God (of whom no name, no image, and no concept can claim comprehension) is also fitting for man: man, and he alone among all the living, was created not “according to [his] kind” but “in [the] image … [and] likeness” of God (Gen. 1:24, 26). This paradox receives a precise commentary from Saint Augustine: “
         be renewed in the newness of your mind. That is not a makingaccording to kind[secundum genus], as if renewal were achieved by imitating a neighbour’s example or by living under the authority of a human superior. For you did not say ‘Let man be made according to his kind’ [secundum genus], but ‘Let us make man according to our image and likeness,’ so we may prove what your will is.”24Man remains unimaginable, because he is formed in the image of the One who admits no image whatsoever. By right, man resembles nothing, because he resembles nothing other than the One who is properly characterized by incomprehensibility, the One who David Tracy has named “the Incomprehensible‐Comprehensible God.”25Or again, if God remains incomprehensible, man, who r~<br>

Abstract: Lawrence Stone, “A Life of Learning,”
            ACLS Newsletter36 (Winter–Spring 1985): 12, captures his ironic tone: “In Britain, the post‐war period was a time of boundless optimism and confidence.… To us young men who returned from the war in 1945, the whole world seemed to be our oyster, and all problems of scholarship—to say nothing of those of suffering humanity—were thought to be soluble.… In history, some of us had much the same hubristic confidence in a wholly new approach. We were dedicated converts to theAnnalesschool of history based in Paris, and we were certain that the most intractable problems of history would soon fall to the assaults of quantitative social and economic investigation. The political narrative mode of our elders—‘L’histoire historisante’ as it was derogatively called—was beneath our contempt. In time, we believed, such hitherto unsolved problems as the causes of the English or the French Revolutions, or the origins of capitalism and the rise of the bourgeoisie, would be solved by our new tools and new approaches. Bliss it was to be alive and a radical social historian in 1945. We waited breathlessly for each new issue ofAnnalesor theEconomic History Review,every one of which seemed to contain an article which opened up great new vistas of historical exploration and interpretation.”<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Understood on the model of metaphor, comparative theology is a creative, constructive activity that is at the same time faithful to the home tradition that it redescribes. This conception of comparative theology as a “poetic” activity that redescribes the tradition through an innovative construction of meaning represents the key, I believe, to understanding how a Christian comparative theology is able to reconcile a sincere openness to the claims of other religions with an uncompromising Christocentrism. We may cite Martin Luther King Jr.’s well‐known encounter with the thought of Gandhi as a paradigm for such a possibility. King credited Gandhi with revealing to him the possibility of extending the ethical teachings of Jesus into the realm of political action.
         50Viewing the Sermon on the Mount through the lens of Gandhi’s concept of satyagraha revealed the full breadth of the gospel teaching. Gandhi’s life reflected a dimension of Jesus’s life and teaching that had been obscured by more familiar patterns of interpretation. King’s willingness to learn from the follower of another religious path thus led to a deeper understanding of, and a renewed commitment to, the teachings of Christianity.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: What’s the difference between a “limit” and a “boundary,” and does it make a difference? Does it matter, for example, that
      Grenzenin the title of Immanuel Kant’s major work on the philosophy of religion,Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft, is perhaps better translated as “boundaries” and not as “limits”? According to Patrick Bourgeois’s recent book,Philosophy at the Boundary of Reason: Ethics and Postmodernity, much hangs on this distinction. The book pursues three interlocking agendas, each concerning themes of interest to scholars of religion and ethics. The author’s primary agenda is to draw attention to what he sees as a neglected philosophical distinction within the Kantian critical philosophy crucial to a proper interpretation of the notion of the “limit‐boundary of reason” and to the ruinous effects the failure to apprehend this distinction unleashed within twentieth‐century philosophy. Second, he pursues an important new reading of Paul Ricoeur as a philosopher who gets the idea of the limit‐boundary of reason right in his hermeneutical phenomenology. Finally, Bourgeois tries to show how getting the distinction right makes it possible to extricate the positive elements of postmodern ethics (especially Emmanuel Lévinas’s recognition of the ethical claim of alterity) from deconstruction’s false philosophy of limit as closure. In Bourgeois’s view, deconstruction decenters meaning and subjectivity to so large a degree as to render responsible human agency ineffectual.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Abstract: While mutual recognition of free participatory agency thus provides a minimum universal standard for mutual recognition of worth and precludes recognition on demand, the question remains whether that minimum condition can become more encompassing of the values and practices of individual religious communities—encompassing to the extent that there will emerge some kind of unifying narrative of identity constructing a cultural space within which a genuinely solidaristic acceptance of one another in friendship could blossom and an interreligiously coalitional politics of resistance could unfold. A positive answer to this question is not impossible, for the parochial yet universalized evaluative horizon of a religious community can become open to an increasing degree of convergence of a sort with that of another via self‐transformation and not necessarily devolve into an idolatry of the particular that is forgetful of the sociohistorical conditions of its own production. Although it may be the case, as postliberals claim, that religious communities constitute semiotic “worlds” irreducible to one another, that does not mean that their criteria of interpretation and evaluation are immune to change or that the boundaries of their horizons do not shift. Religions, like cultures, are not monolithic, fixed, and sui generis entities existing by themselves but rather thoroughly relational “concrete totalities” whose respective boundaries and internal configurations are constantly changing in accordance with alterations in their sociohistorical conditions.
         30Religious identity is not a stable and static set of commonly held beliefs, ideas, symbolic forms, and texts deposited in tradition and acting unilaterally as regulative grammar but a site of both regularity and contestation in which people as embodied carriers of tradition generate the sense of who they are religiously by skillfully negotiating and contesting various social and cultural identities coursing through ~<br>

Abstract: Ibid., 83. For Tesauro, the metaphor of the saint as shield is of great relevance. If in
            SympathyMaurice and the shroud are the shields of the Catholic Savoy family, inEdipo(Oedipus, 1661), Tesauro’s interpretation of Seneca’s tragedy, Oedipus is the shield that prevents the divinity from exerting his power of purification. In Tesauro’s tragedy, Oedipus holds a long monologue on the “voracious plague” that afflicts the city of Thebes. A praetor replies to the Oedipus that the heavens are merciful because “they oppose your [Oedipus’s] virtue like a shield against their own furor.” See Emanuele Tesauro,Edipo, ed. Carlo Ossola (Venice: Marsilio, 1987), 1.1, verse 4, 79, and verses 47–48, 80. We could thus say that, for Tesauro, Maurice is a sort of anti‐Oedipus who has made himself into a lucid mirror of the shroud (the shield reflecting divine will). The saint’s body is a transparent surface reflecting and “actualizing” the “symbol” of the shroud. By contrast, Oedipus’s ignorance of his sins is a darkened, blind shield that prevents the divinity from shining through.<br>

Abstract: A far more urgent issue for Christian interpretation is the unpredictable consequences of learning the “language” of the Jewish tradition, including the nearest Jewish equivalent to Christian literal reading. To discover Midrash in all its subtlety and breadth of options and to understand
            peshat(the traditional sense) may well be to begin to repair a series of contacts established and broken time and again, whenever linguistic and textual Old Testament issues become pressing in intra‐Christian debate. Perhaps the future may be better than the past as a result of the intervening period of liberal scholarship and the persuasion that the two religions, even though closely intertwined, are quite distinct, each with its own integrity. The convergence of distinctness and commensurability between them has yet to be discovered, and attention to Midrash and to the literal sense may play a significant part in the discovery.53<br>

Abstract: To conduct the research, I first identified a teacher at Eternal Grace who was herself a member of the school’s faith community.
         5With the help of two project assistants,6I then observed and tape‐recorded the entirety of her 3‐month‐long Holocaust unit, interviewing her before and after the unit and following the reactions of a group of five students throughout. The students were selected for their adherence to the school’s faith—in Alan Peshkin’s (1986) terminology they were “believers” rather than “scorners”—and each was interviewed individually. The data sources included transcribed class sessions, interviews, collected curricular materials, written field notes, and copies of all student work. Using techniques from grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin1990), the transcriptions were coded for emergent categories of meaning. From them we rendered a portrait (Lawrence‐Lightfoot and Davis1997) of the religious master narratives at play and an interpretation of how they contributed to students’ understandings of the Holocaust (Schweber and Irwin2003).<br>

Abstract: Unfried's article itself can be approached in different ways. One can see it as a case of speculative interpretation, based not on first‐hand research but on a priori models. This is, of course, a more charitable way of saying that it is a case of sloppy research, given the fact that by the time he was writing his article there had already been numerous Bulgarian publications on the novel cultural treatment of former monuments, the mausoleum included.
         56But one can also treat it as a case of scholarly balkanism: the notion that explanatory approaches to phenomena in southeastern Europe often rest upon a discourse (in the Foucauldian sense)—or upon what might be called a stable system of stereotypes by those who shun the notion of “discourse”—that places the Balkans in a cognitive straitjacket. InImagining the Balkans,I refrained from generalizing about scholarly output, maintaining that the scholarly project moves along different lines than does the production of popular mythology and only occasionally intersects with it. My caveat was: “This is not to say that a great number of the scholarly practitioners of Balkan studies in the West do not share privately a staggering number of prejudices; what it says is that, as a whole, the rules of scholarly discourse restrict the open articulation of these prejudices.”57I still believe this to be true, and if I have erred, it is only in the direction of too much leniency.<br>

Abstract: Here, the implied moral “tension” may be compared, by way of illustration, to Sigmund Freud’s rather narrower interpretive hermeneutical “tension” between the active ego and the passivity of the id and the superego. Just as psychological health arises from a productive “working through” of conflicts and repressions at the dynamic intersection of consciousness and the unconscious (in such ongoing practices as dream interpretation, psychoanalytic catharsis, and superego sublimation), so also in moral life may intersubjective and historical tensions move the self toward previously unformed and even cathartic meaning in relation to others. Social, relational, historical, and cultural “tension”—a term that comes from the Latin
         tensioor “stretching”—is a condition for the possibility of moral identity and meaning in the first place. The human moral “desire to be” is realized through an original, unavoidable, restless, and indeed apparently infinite innovation and working through of new social relations.<br>

Abstract: The third and final chapter of the book carries the title of “Mutual Recognition.” This chapter is profound and original. Many readers will first notice that Ricoeur takes the position of the opposing party from the influential reading in France of the lectures on Hegel by Alexandre Kojève, published in 1947. According to Kojève, what takes place during the master and slave dialectic in the
      Phenomenology of Spiritis a struggle for recognition that concludes either in domination or death. Some Hegelians, such as Robert R. Williams, have gone so far as to say that many French postmodernists have built their approach in an unspoken embrace or rejection of Kojève’s alleged misinterpretation of Hegel. Ricoeur eschews these tangled waters by sticking with the theme of Otherness in Levinas and showing its ramifications in, for instance, the interpretation of the young Hegel by Axel Honneth.<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: Derrida upholds both injunctions of the tradition in question rather than solely privileging the structurally necessary element of secrecy, which Patočka associates with heretical Christianity, to the detriment of the cognitive element in responsibility advanced by Platonism. Yet his innovative interpretation of the heritage of responsibility consists neither in attempting to mediate between both demands nor in establishing their golden mean. Instead, what distinguishes Derrida’s interpretation of the Platonic and the Christian heritages is, first of all, the recognition that “the relation between the Platonic and Christian paradigms throughout the history of morality and politics” is defined by the “
      aporia of responsibility” (GD,p. 24). Responsibility toward this inheritance is itself aporetic; it excludes the choice of one of the inherited conceptions of responsibility at the expense of the other; that is, it requires that both traditions be simultaneously honored without any mitigation of the radicalness of their demands. The injunctions—on the one hand, of full knowledge of one’s actions, on the other, of secrecy—are mutually exclusive; moreover, we are unable to account for either of them. Thus, no program exists that could prescribe a way out of this dilemma.<br>

Article Title: Translating Time: The Nature and Function of Joseph Smith’s Narrative Canon<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>

Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: Smith’s redaction of Genesis continues to emphasize that choice is manifest and freedom is—temporally at least—absolute. Therefore, the terms under which Adam and Eve occupy the garden differ in the JST. While they are commanded not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they are told also, in contrast to the KJV: “Nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I forbid it.”
         55As with all narratives, this dialogue requires interpretation and at least two conclusions are possible. One is legalistic. If they “may” choose, then to choose is not disobedient, even when told not to choose. In the larger context of the operation of agency in Smith’s cosmology, it is more likely that the “may” refers to a necessary condition of Adam and Eve’s existence, not a license to do other than what they had been commanded. This view is supported by the fact that the story of the premortal council, with its emphasis on agency, is inserted in the narrative after God’s instruction not to eat the fruit and, as indicated, prior to the serpent’s offer of an alternative. Adam and Eve have a choice, but they have also been instructed in the right choice and given an example of the dangers of a wrong choice. Smith’s Book of Abraham speaks more obliquely but to the same point and more broadly applied. There God says to the premortal assembly: “Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man. … And another answered. … And the Lord said: I will send the first. And the second was angry and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.”56<br>

Article Title: Two Apologetic Moments in Śaṅkara’s Concept of Brahman<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: Against the first characterization of Advaita teaching, the recognition of the double‐voiced character of Śaṅkara’s interpretation of the
         anayatvamsutra (II.1.14)—that is, as internally constituted by the realist cosmological discourse that it subverts—suggests that the interpretation of theBhāṣya’steaching in terms of the illusionist doctrine ofmāyāvādais reductionistic. Moreover, well‐intentioned attempts to dissociate Śaṅkara frommāyāvādathat presume a monological conception of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse, attempts such as that of Srinivasa Rao mentioned above, end up effectively conceding the claim they set out to deny; their affirmation of the reality of the world typically appeals to a denial of substantial change, a claim that implicitly relegates changing, finite existences to the realm of the unreal.114As for the static and abstract conception of brahman, this notion can be seen as the result of the later tradition’s attempt to impose a rigid, categorical distinction between the concepts ofīśvaraand the highest (paraṃ) brahman. This effort to systematize Śaṅkara’s somewhat inconsistent, fluid, and intuitive use of the termīśvarawith respect to the various expressions for brahman effectively pulls apart the dialectical interplay between the personalistic and impersonalistic aspects of brahman in theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣya. What Hacker characterizes as an “illogical” combination of intuitive theism and intellectual monism can perhaps be better understood as an instance of what Michael Sells, in a discussion of apophatic language in the West, calls “a discourse of double propositions.”115A reading of theBrahma‐sūtra‐Bhāṣyathat appreciates the creative interplay among this text’s multiple voices preserves the vitality and intensity of theBhāṣya’sdiscourse on brahman, a liveliness of expression that we may assume more accurately reflects Śaṅkara’s religious vision.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 518276<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Plate Liedeke<br>
Abstract: What I wish to argue, then, is that just as in Bauman’s perspective, “the world becomes an infinite collection of possibilities[,] a container filled to the brim with a countless multitude of opportunities” (Bauman
         2000, 61), so does the past. Rather than singular and subject to interpretation, the past is something we conjure up for its own sake, for the pleasure of imagining “how we would have related, intellectually and with our bodies, to certain objects … if we had encountered them in their own historical everyday worlds” (Gumbrecht2004, 124). And as we do so, “we reject the question of what benefits we might expect from engaging the past,” for, as Gumbrecht points out, “any possible answer to the question of practical benefits will limit the range of modalities through which we can indulge in the past—and simply enjoy our contact with it” (125). In this light, re‐vision is no longer a matter of revisiting the past in order to project new futures, as Rich and Cixous had it, or of thinking that rewriting would have a demythologizing effect, as Carter thought it would (1983, 71). Rather, the retelling of well‐known stories from alternative points of view becomes part of the shopping, of “scanning the assortment of possibilities, examining, touching, feeling, handling the goods on display … putting some of them in the trolley and others back on the shelf” (Bauman2000, 73). For instance, Disney does not just issue the filmAladdin. Among the merchandising paraphernalia there is alsoDisney's Aladdin: The Genie’s Tale(Kreider1993) andDisney's Aladdin: Jasmine’s Story(Elder1997). These two books exemplify the way in which re‐vision has become an integral part of product marketing and a matter of personal choice. As bedtime approaches, parents turn to their offspring and ask: whose story do you want to hear tonight? Jasmine’s? The Genie’s? Aladdin’s? In fact, the manipulating of consumer goods Bauman speaks of happens quite literally in the Upside Down Tales se~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 527832<br>
Date: 01 2008<br>
Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: In librarianship, the concept of reality and its meaning has been reviewed in detail by Joseph Z. Nitecki [
            55]. Specifically, Nitecki describes three approaches to the philosophical interpretation of the nature of knowledge and the meaning of reality. These are an objective assessment of reality derived from the natural sciences; a subjective, psychosociological realism based on organic behavior and its consequences; and a logical, philosophical definition of reality based on a known and verifiable reality and lesser known expressions about that reality. Nitecki argues that the structures, functions, and forms of librarianship can be understood within these definitions. He goes on to further clarify the role of reality in librarianship by synthesizing three hypothetical viewpoints of how reality is communicated. The empirical viewpoint concerns a reality that encompasses objective, physical existence. The rational viewpoint considers subjective and intuitional perceptions of phenomena. The sociocultural viewpoint of reality is defined by Nitecki as a subjective philosophy of the individual governed by the society in which he or she lives. Although each of these sets of approaches and viewpoints provide a way of understanding the relationship between librarianship and reality, considerations of truth are generally absent. This is despite the fact that reality and the nature of truth are frequently considered in relation to each other in philosophical thought.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Author(s): Elbourne Elizabeth<br>
Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important propone~<br>

Author(s): Reynolds,  Thomas E.<br>
Abstract: Still, the book has significant shortcomings. First, it suffers from a bad case of sprawl. Reynolds attempts to engage the following thinkers at some length: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Hans‐Georg Gadamer, Jürgen Habermas, Gottfried Herder, Emmanuel Levinas, Jean‐Francois Lyotard, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Ricoeur, Richard Rorty, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Charles Taylor, Paul Tillich, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Dozens more receive passing mention. This, however, is nothing compared to the book’s many arguments. Reynolds forwards vast theses not only in philosophical theology and the theory of religion but also in hermeneutics, epistemology, and ethics. For good measure, we also get a typology of world religions (162) and an interpretation of the Enlightenment (22–41). Sheer breadth, of course, is not necessarily a weakness. It can be an impressive sign of intellectual power and agility. In this case, however, it comes at the expense of nuance. Consequently,
      The Broken Wholesometimes reads more like a term paper for a graduate survey course than a focused monograph.<br>

Abstract: Suzanne Nalbantian was the first critic to stress the relevance of this episode in the configuration of memory work in Marcel; her interpretation, however, which hinged on the presumption that all of Marcel’s emotions subsequent to his falling asleep could only decrease the intensity of his original reminiscence, goes in the opposite direction with respect to mine. Marcel’s crossing of the Lethe reverses the direction followed by the souls in Virgil’s underworld; these souls must cross into oblivion in order to be reborn into another body, while Marcel brings his lost “self” (the self that existed in a condition of “mutual predestination,” of reciprocal fusion with his grandmother) back to life by crossing the river backwards, into remembrance.

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 592372<br>
Date: 01 2009<br>
Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Viewed in these Augustinian terms, just‐war morality invites one to ask what a war means—how we interpret ourselves and others regarding matters of life and death. Death raises fundamental questions regarding horizons of meaning and desire, and war asks in the starkest terms whether its participants are willing to impose or take on the ultimate sacrifice. In this respect we continue to travel with Augustine despite our distance from him. For surely he would have us ask whether we possess a second‐order framework for determining whether the desires aroused by killing, death, and sacrifice are themselves desirable. That is to say, Augustine would have us ask about the effects of killing on individual and corporate character and how death affects the practices of self‐interpretation and the public history we wish to write about ourselves. War for Augustine was not only a matter of personal virtue and vice; it also raised questions of meaning and memory as these bear upon the formation of civic identity and the construction of desire across generations.<br>

Author(s): Hall,  W. David<br>
Abstract: Rather than simply reading Ricoeur’s work in chronological sequence to make this case, Hall aims for what he calls a “critical constructive interpretation” that will yield something like a “situated reading” of Ricoeur’s thought (4), one that will better demonstrate this thesis than Ricoeur’s own words do. Basically, the structure of the argument Hall proposes begins from what Ricoeur has to say about the idea of agency in relation to the understanding of selfhood. Hall then moves on to consider the narrative configuration of a meaningful existence that follows from this understanding. He then takes up questions that can arise regarding our practical experience and moral concerns from this perspective. It is the testimony of conscience that comes in at this latter level that brings in the theological perspective. It does so through a discussion of what Ricoeur has to say about the Golden Rule in relation to the love commandment and in relation to what Ricoeur calls a logic of superabundance, one that goes beyond any logic of equivalence. It is this idea of a possible logic of superabundance that leads in turn to a discussion of what Hall calls the economy of the gift and the poetic imperative that Hall sees in Ricoeur’s concept of a theonomy that stands over against Kant’s call for an autonomy that all too easily isolates people from one another. It is love that drives this poetic imperative, and what love calls for is something more than, not less than, justice.<br>

Abstract: And so even as attention drifts to other objects (to TV, the internet, virtual reality, GPS) the peculiar nature of the film object urges the continued growth of film studies. The film object should be treated as distinctive enough—hard enough—to withstand, at least provisionally, the processes of remediation that devalue any given text. The film object in itself and as it funds analysis and interpretation ought not to recede in the academy because its peculiar characteristics make it stand out as anomalous in the constellation of media artifacts.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In affirming “negative rationality” (N5383) at the center of the human subject, Coleridge joins a tradition of asserting theological mysteries (e.g., Tertullian, Blaise Pascal) but also creates a displacement in the traditional concepts of faith and prayer to make the paradoxical cry of Mark 9:24 archetypal. Even when writing about the Lord’s Prayer, his reflections tend to bear its trace. In 1831, for instance, he describes himself as “a paralytic but yet a living Nerve” in Christ’s body and begs “thy Will be
         done: Let but the vital warmth of thy redemptive Love pierce to me” (N6621). The prayer thus translates the petition into a version of Mark 9:24, willing for one’s will to be broken, willing against oneself. The form is characteristic of most of Coleridge’s citations of Matt. 6:10 (see N5516, N5634, N6474). While such an interpretation is not foreign to the great Protestant theologians, it is only one element of their readings: for Coleridge, it appears dominant.42In foregrounding this strange, paradoxical tenor, he looks forward to Søren Kierkegaard, the most notable theologian of paradoxical faith, who would deepen Coleridge’s assertion of an existentialist religious act: “A Faith with a Belief indeed, but with a belief that derives it’s [sic] origin & stability wholly from the Antecedent Faith” (N6666, fol. 85).43<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: The claim that Joyce is the culmination of Christian epic is less persuasive, and part 2 relies too heavily on the work of Gian Balsamo and Altizer. Franke’s contribution is to interpret linguistic repetition in
      Finnegans Wake(London, 1939) as a secular reformulation of negative theology and typology that cannot be definitively interpreted as the death of God. However, I suspect Franke accepts a historical trajectory in which secular literature displaces traditional religion as revelation. If anything, his theological interpretation of Celan, Stevens, and Joyce deconstructs our conventional notion of the secular and demonstrates that literature cannot escape theology. My concern is that we must be careful not to privilege such literature—as the fulfillment of literary or theological tradition—but recognize that Joyce speaks theologically as one voice among many. In short, Franke needs to clarify the role of Joyce in his theoretical argument about poetic language and his practical effort to promote meaningful dialogue. Presumably, Joyce illustrates the apocalyptic power of literature, but does he do so in a way that is representative or superlative in literary or theological terms?<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>
Date: 6 2010<br>
Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Dupré complements this account with an attentiveness to cultural continuities between the Enlightenment and preceding periods. Although historical thought during the eighteenth century tended to privilege the possibilities of the future over obligations to the past, at least some measure of faith in distant origins informs works such as Bossuet's
         Histoire universelleand even Vico'sScienza nuova, the latter imploring readers to preserve the “poetic wisdom” of the ancients or else sacrifice their present to a meaningless rationalism. Nor did eighteenth-century historians unanimously profess a belief in progress. Vico, for instance, viewed providence as a cyclical pattern of advancement and decline. Edward Gibbon, the century's most illustrious historian, went even farther in his refusal to accept Enlightenment claims of progress at face value. Despite his commitment to the idea that material and intellectual improvements could forestall decline, the imposing shadow of Rome cast doubt on the possibility that vast empires could avoid its fate in the end. Dupré's interpretation on this point differs from that of J. G. A. Pocock, who argues in his massive study ofThe Decline and Fallthat Gibbon usually resisted the temptation to equate Rome's landed empire with Britain's maritime, commercial network of colonies. Both Pocock and Dupré agree, however, that Gibbon's work effectively removed Christian ends from narratives of the past, thereby facilitating what Pocock calls “an emancipation of secular history from sacred” (Dupré, 187–228, quote on 195).43<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Just as literature effaces the proper meaning of words, imposing a slippage that leaves the reader with no firm ground to stand on, so this essay effaces the proper meaning of Lévinas's text. To return to Blanchot's letter to Malka, it reveals to us finally what Blanchot meant when he said that in a
         certainway Judaism was so close to him that he could not speak of it. In what way is Judaism close to Blanchot? This proximity is one that must be announced as a distance. In maintaining that distance is not Blanchot declaring himself more loyal than Lévinas to the teaching of deracination, of which Blanchot considers Lévinas to be the teacher? In his letter to Malka and in his rewriting of Lévinas's essay “Heidegger, Gagarin, and Us,” Blanchot is answering Lévinas's call for Judaism to announce a new teaching to the postwar world. Undoubtedly Lévinas intended this call to strengthen both the Jewish community and the broader perception of Judaism's message. Blanchot's interpretation could be interpreted as doing the opposite. At the very least, it ignores the pragmatics of Lévinas's concerns. Yet, for Blanchot, Judaism's political power is only realized in renunciation. Its highest teaching, he suggests, is that there must be a gap between the call and the one in whose name the call is made. This is a space that literature discloses, offering us a mode of political speech that does not operate on the principle of mythical identification but rather ceaselessly interrupts itself, reminding us that fulfillment is not yet.<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects. To blame the rhetorician Augustine for “not k~<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Throughout the work, his approach is one that focuses on the key thinkers in the history of Western thought so as to illuminate the continuities and changes within the understanding of hermeneutics. Friedrich Schleiermacher, for instance, is named as the first turning point for inaugurating the modern subjective turn in hermeneutics by shifting its task from “rules of interpretation” to the “art of understanding.” He names Hans-Georg Gadamer as the second turning point for retrieving and rehabilitating notions of community, authority, history, and tradition for a more robust and rounded theory of hermeneutics. In addition to Schleiermacher and Gadamer, Thistleton accordingly devotes substantial sections and even separate chapters to other key thinkers in modern hermeneutics such as Wilhelm Dilthey, Rudolf Bultmann, and Paul Ricoeur. Thistleton is at his best in this work when he gives the sustained attention and acute analyses that these seminal thinkers in modern and contemporary hermeneutics deserve.<br>

Abstract: Thirty minutes is a rough figure. The shift begins some time after 1:14, when Charlie asks how “the great Donald” would solve the script problem, and ends, depending on one's interpretation, either with the deaths of Laroche and Donald (1:41–45) or the triumphant departure of Charlie (1:49).<br>

Article Title: Why Devils Came When Faustus Called Them<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 660269<br>
Date: 08 2011<br>
Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: In contrast to the riddling texts that use Faustus's body and that demand interpretation, “this show,” although allegorical in the morality tradition, here means “nothing.” It demands no interpretation, no deferral of significance, no acknowledgment of transcendence. It is all surface. The “crowns” and the “rich apparel” that the devils give Faustus emblematize the attention to materials and to outsides that characterizes both life in hell and a certain kind of disinterested aestheticism which in this context functions only to deceive. Over and over, Mephistopheles tricks Faustus into believing that the shows conjured up in the theater of hell's delights find their ends in the enjoyment of their own performance. Perhaps his most telling trick is to seem to make “music” (2.3.30) with Amphion simply to provide “sweet pleasure” (2.3.25) to Faustus. Amphion along with Orpheus usually exemplifies the dream of an instrumental aesthetics, a beauty that can pacify beasts and even compel rocks and stones to organize themselves into cities with its moving sweetness of song. But Mephistopheles makes this sweet pleasure seem inconsequential, as he makes all magic seem inconsequential, as if magic were a production that celebrated only itself, showed only “what magic can perform,” or as if the delight inspired by the spirits personated on stage had no effect. But, of course, there will be an effect, no end of effect, just not yet.<br>

Author(s): Vásquez Manuel A.<br>
Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: A psychoanalytic interpretation suggests itself in light of the recognition that “disgust is antithetical to sexual desire” and that “disgust sensitivity is negatively correlated with the desire to engage in a variety of sexual behaviors,” (D. M. T. Fessler and C. D. Navarrete, “Domain Specific Variation in Disgust Sensitivity Across the Menstrual Cycle,”
         Evolution and Human Behavior24 [2003]: 407), namely that the repulsion felt towards sex with the menstruant derives its intensity from the need to counteract sexual attraction.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: I am grateful to this international group of scholars for accepting the invitation to engage my argument. My main points are that morality is not a cultural system but a modality of action present across all domains of human life, and that an anthropological approach to morality must recognize evil as an existential category. In other words, the article is neither a study of witchcraft for its own sake nor evil in its own right but a commentary on a particular moment in anthropological thinking about morality. Helene Basu recognizes the intent of my neologistic move toward homodicy and ethnodicy as alternatives to theodicy, which is to identify a starting point for anthropology distinct from those of theological anthropology or theology, in the shadow of which anthropology has approached morality obliquely if at all. She aptly identifies the importance of “concrete, situated human actions” and the “practical logic of evil.” To her question of whether this practical logic is discernible in violent encounters framed in terms other than witchcraft, the answer is an emphatic yes. Witchcraft is not the only evil, just as evil does not account for all of morality. Basu’s example of racial hatred in Germany shows morality as a modality of social action generating personal illness, collective suspicion and distrust, and an atmosphere of injustice. This supports my emphasis on the adjectival quality of moral action and moral interpretation rather than on a nominal morality, and on moral experience rather than on the structure of a moral code. Her interpretive polarity between police and immigrants might also be seen as a triangular one, including the violent right-wing xenophobes as moral actors, if there can be a morality of hatred. A practical contribution of evil as an analytic category in such an instance may be to help preserve cultural relativism while avoiding moral relativism.<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: The treatment of the ancient and modern examples is also somewhat too neat and overly selective. For example, it is definitely appropriate to analyze the relationship between theory and practice in rabbinic Judaism on the basis of Hadot’s analysis of ancient philosophy. But Fisher should have reflected on the interplay of theory and praxis in rabbinic Judaism in light of the Aristotelian tradition, which is utterly and consistently ignored in this book. Similarly, Fisher admits that his analysis of
      Mekhihta of Rabbi Yishmaelis indebted to Max Kadushin’s insightful presentation of rabbinic Judaism as “organismic” system of value concepts (105), but Fisher does not analyze the philosophical basis of Kadushin’s reading, as does Peter Ochs, whose book is cited in the notes but whose analysis is not engaged. The treatment of Rosenzweig also exhibits a penchant for selectivity. To show how his model of Jewish theological practice applies to contemporary debates about Rosenzweig and therefore to contemporary Jewish theology, Fisher singles out two interpreters: Leora Batnitzky (whose interpretation he finds “idiosyncratic” [163]) and Peter Gordon (who is accused of “grossly distor[ting] Rosenzweig’s point” [166]). While Fisher’s own interpretation of Rosenzweig is most suggestive, whether Jewish theological practice is a viable model cannot be decided by showing the limitations of two interpretations of Rosenzweig to the exclusion of all others.<br>

Abstract: Janet Adelman sees in Lear’s actions “the rage of an abandoned infant.” G. Wilson Knight remarks that the king’s “tremendous soul” is “incongruously geared to a puerile intellect.” According to Knight, “Lear is mentally a child; in passion, a Titan.” For Jan Kott, both Lear and Gloucester are “too ridiculous” to be tragic: they are “clowns who do not yet know they are clowns.” Nowhere is this more apparent than in Gloucester’s attempt to end his life. The attempted suicide, Kott writes, “is merely a circus somersault on an empty stage…the classic expression of buffoonery.” See Janet Adelman,

Issue: 674410<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Rüpke Jörg<br>
Abstract: In Varro, things are much more complicated. I have always read the
         Antiquitates rerum divinarumas relating to Roman religion, but closer reading shows this interpretation to be partial at best. Augustine discusses the sequence of the treatment of human and divine affairs in theAntiquitates:
               
            Rerum quippe humanarum libros, non quantum ad orbem terrarum, sed quantum ad solam Romam pertinet, scripsit, quos
            tamenrerum divinarum libris se dixit scribendi ordine merito praetulisse.
                     
               53
                  
               The opposition or paradox implied by Augustine’s[[Varro] wrote the books on human things, which do not concern the whole world, but just Rome, which he nevertheless, as he said, positioned in the order of writing fully justified before the books on divine things.]
            tamenworks only if a larger than urban, probably a universal orientation of the latter part of the oeuvre is to be assumed. To talk of the “universal” in regard to antiquity always needs an additional note. The standards of universality were set by Greek thinking, based on the experience of theoikoumeneof the Mediterranean world, Greek colonization, international trade, and the Hellenistic empires. Beyond that, thebarbaroiremained, peoples only occasionally acknowledged to have human culture.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673118<br>
Date: 09 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Huth Kimberly<br>
Abstract: Figurative language may not be a primary means of conveying painful sensation, but it is paramount in assigning significance to those sensations and affecting audience reactions to its portrayal—perhaps even coercing them into an interpretation they would otherwise reject. In the artistic and theatrical exploration of human suffering, metaphors and pain are intimately linked because it is this interpretive trope that cues audience response and assigns meaning to an otherwise horrifyingly senseless bodily experience. The figures of pain discussed here attest to the artistry of these playwrights, but also to the power of metaphor and other tropes to shape the thinking of an entire culture. As Wayne C. Booth writes of metaphor’s role in community discourse, “The metaphors we care for most are always embedded in metaphoric structures that finally both depend on and constitute selves and societies.”
   
            Early modern culture utilized numerous discourses to make sense of pain, from seeing it as a sign of devotion in the Petrarchan lover or religious martyr to construing it as evidence of guilt in systems of corporal or capital punishment. Early modern tragic theater draws on those cultural narratives, but it also serves as a space for practicing the types of interpretation needed to make sense of pain—an understanding that extended outward at the close of the play. By being attentive to the moments of spectacular suffering that define these plays, by noting the philosophical and affective purposes those spectacles serve, we can see at work the same systems of interpretation that made possible many early modern cultural discourses, from the literary to the judicial to the spiritual. Far from being irreconcilable, pain and metaphor work in conjunction in early modern tragedy to create a durable interpretive community out of a single, yet multifaceted, physical experience.51<br>

Abstract: Closely related to the philosophical problem of consciousness of time was the question of the meaning of time and duration in psychology and in literature. Although Mooij mentions William James's notion of “specious present” in passing, he fails to explicate James's perception of time, which attempted to provide an empiricist account of our temporal concepts through the influence of John Locke (p. 197). Apart from this caveat, the book's strength lies in its perceptiveness and breadth of interpretation of the history of the concept of time. Mooij's accuracy in comprehending and in transmitting the essence of such difficult and complicated philosophies is remarkable.<br>

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Date: 10 2014<br>
Author(s): Cochran Timothy B.<br>
Abstract: In volume six of
         Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d’ornithologie, Olivier Messiaen uses the phrase “the pebble in the water” to identify a class of especially stark rhythmic contrasts in Debussy’s music that feature long durations interrupted by rapid rhythms. He invests these contrasts with an expressive logic built around the concept of shock—that is, the sudden stimulation of a static context by an outside presence. Messiaen unites various images—both natural and psychological—around this expressive pattern via analogy, suggesting that its essence is transferrable within a network of associated metaphors. Although for the most part in volume six Messiaen refrains from linking interpretations of Debussy with his own music, many of his rhythmic contrasts manifest the same expressive logic that he ascribes to Debussy’s music, particularly durational events that signify the interjection of birdsong within serene environments and that signal the striking appearance of divine power on earth. In addition to stylistic and semiotic correlations, the logic of shock theorized for the pebble in the water recurs more abstractly in Messiaen’s idiomatic views on musical experience and spiritual encounter. His interpretation of rhythmic contrast bears the marks of his more general aesthetics of shock, which in turn can be read as a reorientation of a broader modernist hermeneutic.<br>

Abstract: Although the clarity with which Wu writes makes this book accessible to nonspecialists, he evidently assumes the reader is familiar with China and the subject of tombs. For example, no maps are included, despite frequent mentions made of specific provinces and cities. Additionally, no matter how obscure or technical the terms, he provides Chinese characters in only one instance (128). The reliance on pinyin romanization may make it somewhat frustrating for specialists encountering these terms for the first time to understand them or even to look them up in a dictionary. Oddly, several line drawings and diagrams only employ Chinese characters; it would have been helpful for Wu to translate these. However, these minor shortcomings do not overshadow the overall importance of this book. On account of its remarkably original theoretical approach,
   The Art of the Yellow Springsis essential reading material for anyone interested in a new interpretation of Chinese tombs.<br>

Abstract: Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" (1862) has garnered seemingly limitless critical interpretation — the goblins' remarkable fruit inviting allegorical readings of the poem that reference, most popularly, Christianity, sexuality, and capitalism. In this essay I read fruit simply as food, situating the poem within the context of food adulteration contemporary with its 1859 composition. Food adulteration was a widespread problem in Victorian England, as increasing numbers of merchants cut flour with alum, doctored curry with mercury, and enhanced the appearance of potted fruits and vegetables with copper and lead. Public alarm regarding this form of fraud reached its height in the 1850s, largely due to the work of an independent Analytical Sanitary Commission, which published its findings in
         The Lancetbetween 1851 and 1854. While Parliament responded to these reports with the formation of a Select Committee in 1855, the popular press responded with articles, tracts, and ballads addressing this pandemic problem. Manuals that instructed consumers how to protect themselves by acquiring the accoutrements of home laboratories proliferated, as did references to adulteration in popular literature. In this essay I read Rossetti's poem as an example of this type of reference. The market of the poem's title, I argue, references a literally contaminated marketplace in which the numbers of people who ate ostensibly nutritious food, only to wither and die in consequence, provoked both governmental and popular alarm.<br>

Abstract: 2. An interpretation of Viennese music during those years as an "emphatic" modernism. Its continuities with later nineteenth-century music are stressed. Each term in the concept "First Viennese Modernism" is critical: "First," to distinguish it from the Schoenberg school; "Viennese," to distinguish its modest and local origins from its later dominance of the entire European continent; and "modernism," on four grounds: (a) its contemporary reception; (b) its status as the earliest repertory to have been cultivated unbroken from its own time to ours; (c) its status as the first autonomous (not primarily mimetic) instrumental music and as the earliest self-problematizing music; (d) its participation in the creation of modern (post-revolutionary) history, by means of what is (synecdochically) interpreted as Haydn's sublime, in the Kantian sense.<br>

Abstract: In the text-based disciplines, psychoanalysis and Marxism have had a major influence on how we read, and this has been expressed most consistently in the practice of symptomatic reading, a mode of interpretation that assumes that a text's truest meaning lies in what it does not say, describes textual surfaces as superfluous, and seeks to unmask hidden meanings. For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.<br>

Date: November 1984<br>
Author(s): Jorgensen Danny L.<br>
Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Abstract: In this cranky and arrogant chapter I consider several aspects of my use of symbolic interactionist perspectives on my research and thinking. The following are the elements of the chapter: (1) the historical context of my initial encounter with symbolic interactionism (SI); (2) my interpretation of key ideas of SI; (3) its relation to specific research of mine; (4) the relation of other perspectives to my research; and (5) some critiques of SI. I conclude with a truncated discussion of my dissatisfaction with the overtheorizing and overscientizing of sociology. Seeking balance, I end with predictions of a grand and glorious future.<br>

Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: si.2011.34.issue-1<br>
Date: 02 2011<br>
Author(s): Bernasconi Oriana<br>
Abstract: Sociology and neighboring disciplines have produced different analytic tools to examine the dialogical relationship between individuals and society ("narrative work," "identity work," "moral career," "moral breakdown"). However, the question of how individuals negotiate the interpretation of personal experience over their lifetimes in a changing cultural context remains unexplored. This article introduces narrative elasticity as a feature of narrative work and as a time-sensitive analytic tool for conducting inquiries into processes of temporal retraction and expansion of what storytellers conceive as the normal order of significance. The application of this tool to the analysis of mature and elderly Chileans' life stories shows how cultural change occurs at the individual level, considers factors that motivate and inhibit processes of reinterpretation of personal experience, and identifies different levels at which it operates.<br>

Article Title: The Adventures of Interpretation: Approaches to Validity<br>
Publisher: John Wiley & Sons<br>
Issue: i250417<br>
Date: 12 1, 1981<br>
Author(s): Wilson Ewald<br>
Abstract: Three different types of interpretative research in education are discussed: ethnographic-descriptive, dialogical, and structuralistic. The special concepts of interpretation and validity connected with each of these approaches are elaborated and examples are given. The author comes to the conclusion that it is misleading to use the term "interpretative methods" in a general way, because the differences in the types of interpretive research are ignored. He argues that in educational research a dialogical, argumentative concept of validating interpretations is necessary.<br>

Abstract: Narrative structures are readily available in our culture and people automatically draw on them in most meaning-making activities. The research interview is one of many such activities. Narrative structures influence how informants remember their experience and subsequently tell researchers about it in an interview. Researchers also draw upon narrative structures because they hear and understand in narratives. Informal or implicit interpretation as opposed to explicit interpretation are discussed. The "iceberg" metaphor is used to describe the two kinds of interpretation. The tip of the iceberg is explicit interpretation, which is what researchers write in their research reports. The biggest part, however, is informal interpretation. It is out of sight and usually unexamined because it is built into the strategies researchers employ to make sense of data.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers, Inc.<br>

Author(s): Whorf Carola<br>
Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Author(s): Schwaller De Lubicz William<br>
Abstract: This paper follows two purposes: the first to unpack some of the artistic cargo of symbols as distinct from the more conventional aspects of them (e. g., their ability to refer to other things or events, and their ability to communicate ideas), and the second to show, by means of contrasts, the actual workings of Interpretation Theory as it could be applied to the analysis of art-making and art-viewing. For the first purpose, the author draws material from philosophy, dramatic writings, linguistic theory, and statements of artists in an analytic search for the often intractable character of the artistic image. For the second purpose, the author demonstrates, through the use of logic and the poetic metaphor, how a particular form of hermeneutic inquiry can be applied to assist an understanding of the assumptions upon which research is often built.<br>

Abstract: This article discusses how T. S. Eliot's long poem, Four Quartets, employs the thematics of time, self, and history in an autobiographical work of literature. The article approaches autobiography primarily as an intellectual concern, rather than as a factual account of the author's life, in examining a work that is difficult to subsume under available interpretive paradigms. The first part of the article emphasizes how Augustine's Confessions, when considered as a meditation on time and religious experience, illuminates the hermeneutics of Four Quartets. The second and central part of the article provides close readings of key passages in this poem, which inscribes Greek cosmology and medieval epic in a narrative of literary development and spiritual change. The third and concluding part of the article explores how the author's later poetry and criticism highlight major tendencies in twentieth-century literature and anticipate the postmodern interpretation of history. / تعالج هذه المقالة قصيدة ﺇﻟﻴﻮﺕ الطويلة أربع رباعيات من منطلق جديد وبالرجوع إلى تيمات الزمن والذات والتاريخ في السيرة الذاتية الأدبية٠ وتتعامل المقالة مع السيرة الذاتية لا باعتبارها سجلاﹰ لما جرى في حياة صاحبها من أحداث، بل ابعتبارها سجلاﹰ مضمراﹰ للتطور الذهني لكاتبها٠ يقوم الجزء الأول من المقالة بتوظيف البعد ﺍﻟﺘﺄﻣﻠﻲ في الزمن وفي التجربة الدينية كما ورد عند القديس أوغسطين في سيرته الذاتية الاعترافات، لإضاءة المدار التأويلي لقصيدة أربع رباعيات٠ ويقوم الجزء الثاني بتحليل مقاطع رئيسية في القصيدة، مبرزاﹰ ما تتضمنه وما تلوّح به من معتقدات كونية إغريقية وملاحم وسيطية٠ أما الجزء الثالث والأخير فيتوصل إلى أن ذهنية إليوت، بالإضافة إلى كونها تعكس التوجه العام للأدب في القرن العشرين، تمهد للتفسير ما بعد الحداثي للتاريخ٠<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Steven D.<br>
Abstract: Methods of studying religion can be divided into those which help the investigator "understand" religion from the believer's standpoint and those which "explain" religion in the terms of the sciences. Yet despite the contemporary polemics, these methods need not be alienated from one another. Applying the hermeneutic theory of Paul Ricoeur we can see that the study of religion involves us in an act of interpretation which necessarily requires both methods of understanding and explanation. Ricoeur's theory is employed to show how these methods can be systematically used in tandem so that the most adequate interpretation of the religious world is produced.<br>

Author(s): VetterAbstract: Arguments by Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta for evidence of a Self that is one and the same as the Great Lord Śiva are interpreted. The views of these authors are clarified and the contradictory relationship between the limited individual subject and the recognition of the true Self is shown. With the help of Utpaladeva's distinction between "seeing" and "noticing," a further interpretation is attempted. Some remarks are made concerning practical meditation and the theoretical presuppositions of this way of thinking in order to find starting points for a comparison with Western philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Aspects of the Pratyabhijñā philosophical theology for monistic Śaivism of the ninth- and tenth-century Kashmiri thinkers Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta are interpreted in relation to their relevance and pre-sumptiveness to contemporary Western thought. It is claimed that the Pratyabhijñā system elucidates important features of our past and present deliberations about the role of interpretation in experience and provides us with a sound way of arguing for the reality of God.<br>

Publisher: University of Notre Dame<br>
Issue: i261417<br>
Date: 7 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Patoeka Edward F.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the ties between the work of Václav Havel and his dissident mentor Jan Patočka. Havel's political theory consists largely of an evocative, literary reformulation of a number of themes developed by Patočka, the student of Husserl and Heidegger generally recognized as the most significant Czech philosopher of the century. Insofar as Patočka's work continues to be ignored in the West, the intuitively appealing essays of Havel will themselves fail to be fully understood. This study offers an analysis of Havel's debt to Patočka, as well as an explication of the latter's political thought. With Patočka's phenomenological interpretation of ancient and contemporary thought, of Socrates and Heidegger, a bridge is built between the classical and the postmodern that seeks to ground ethics and politics without recourse to the foundationalism of metaphysical accounts of reality.<br>

Abstract: In recent years it has become increasingly common to speak of the international or global common good. It remains unclear, however, what political content attaches to this expression, and how it relates to more traditional conceptions of the common good rooted in the context of the polis or the nation-state. This article examines the ramifications of extending this time-honored concept to a transnational framework, focusing in particular on the evolving rhetoric of the political common good in Catholic social thought. The first part traces the emergence of the transnational common good in Catholic thinkers such as Maritain, Murray, and Messner, as well as in the encyclical tradition. The second part addresses, from the standpoint of political theory, problems of scope, structure, and application attending the expansion of the common good. The concluding section proposes a multilayered, heuristic interpretation of the common good organized around the notion of a "plurality of pluralisms."<br>

Author(s): Gadamer Stephen<br>
Abstract: The title of this essay comes from contemporary hermeneutics, a branch of philosophy devoted to interpretation. It refers to the domain between a human artifact and a beholder. Brought to architecture, this worldly concept implicitly questions the conventional role of the individual amidst historical works. It also offers a common ground on which products of architectural interpretation (performances or fictions) may begin to engage our normally independent territories of history and design. This essay examines the concept of the world in front of the work and speculates on its implications for architectural education. The illustrations portray interpretive projects by the author's students.<br>

Article Title: Is Zoroastrianism Dualistic or Monotheistic?<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263718<br>
Date: 12 1, 1961<br>
Author(s): Zaehner Donald A.<br>
Abstract: The question raised in the title has been much debated by past and present interpreters of Zoroastrianism. In the first two parts of this paper we present some dualistic and monotheistic interpretations of the religion. The interpretations can be labeled as follows: 1. DUALISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks Omnipotence And Omniscience (Dhalla, Henning) 2. The View That Angra Mainyu Is Primordial But Lacks A Physical Nature (Shaked, Boyce) II. MONOTHEISTIC INTERPRETATIONS 1. The Created Spirits View (Zaehner, Fox, Gershevitch) 2. The Transformationist (Maskhiyya) View 3. The Zurvānite View 4. The View That Good And Evil Are Coeternal Only In A Logical Sense (Moulton, Bode and Nanavutty, Duchesne-Guillemin) We present each of these views and discuss it critically in light of the following criteria: (1) textual evidence; (2) the continuity of the religion throughout its history, including the present time; (3) philosophical cogency; and (4) religious satisfaction. Our conclusion is that each of the above positions, despite its elements of strength, falls seriously short of one or more of these criteria, and hence that there is need for a more adequate interpretation of Zoroastrianism than any of them can offer. Accordingly, we present another interpretation in order to provoke further discussion and, hopefully, to advance the cause of trying to gain a more precise grasp of the teachings of this remarkable religion. In brief, the interpretation we favor is that Zoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique to itself among the major religions of the world. This combination results in a religious outlook which cannot be categorized as either straightforward dualism or straightforward monotheism, meaning that the question in the title of this paper poses a false dichotomy. The dichotomy arises, we contend, from a failure to take seriously enough the central role played by time in Zoroast~<br>

Issue: i263715<br>

Author(s): Windisch William A.<br>
Abstract: Considered rhetorically, or by phenomenological-literary analysis, the saying about finding one's life by losing it intends to break up the continuity of existence of the hearer to the extent that he or she is left without a frame of reference. Considered from a historical-literary point of view, however, the saying occurs in an environment and presupposes a context which gives meaning to the response. A Whiteheadian or process perspective of interpretation offers an approach which can relate these two types of understanding of the saying, and can also cast light on contemporary styles of interpretation with their ontological presuppositions, either to set the saying in a framework of "rightness" or in one of "creativity."<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263715<br>
Date: 3 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Wittig Theodore J.<br>
Abstract: The Parable of the Sower has fallen under an ancient and modern hermeneutical eclipse. Critical examination of the Markan text of the Markan text of the parable (4:3-9) indicates that the first hermeneutical eclipse of the parable's message occurred when the community which produced the interpretation of the Parable of the Sower (Mark 4:14-20) reworked the parable to conform to the community's theological needs. Removal of this community's reworked features from the text lays bare the original form of the Sower and gives us access to Jesus' original parabolic message. But apprehension of the full depth and scope of that message has not been possible with current hermeneutical methodologies. The limitations of these hermeneutics leave the message still under partial eclipse. By expanding the interpretative horizon with the help of Whiteheadian insights on ontology, epistemology, and the phenomenology of language, one is able to appreciate more fully the meaning of Jesus' proclamation in the Parable of the Sower.<br>

Author(s): Wiggins Mary<br>
Abstract: In recent years, the need for a critique of "reader" as rigorous as that which has been developed for "text" and for "author" has become increasingly acute. Whether in the study of religion as story and biography or in interpretative reading in general, a critical notion of reader is essential if the act of reading is to be anything other than mere consumption of texts. Some new way of understanding the hermeneutical circle is required to avert the narcissism latent in the Anselmian model. The notion of "genre" as developed by four recent theorists is helpful in the task of constructing a critique of "reader." E. D. Hirsch, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Tzvetán Todorov, and Paul Ricoeur have each surpassed the idealist notion of genre as a classificatory device and developed in its place the notion of genre as a generative pinciple. Todorov, for example, illustrates how "form" is a theoretical, as distinct from a descriptive or explanatory, issue. According to both Hirsch and Todorov, somewhere between empirical details and metaphysical thematizations lie generic formulations which can assist the reader to organize his/her response to the text and to recognize the probable understanding toward which the conventions of the text are directed. In Gadamer's theory of interpretation, the notion of genre acquires historicity. After Gadamer, genres can no longer be regarded as timeless a priori categories. Rather, because they are constituted by historical reflections, their rise and decline are intrinsic to text-interpretation. Finally, in Ricoeur's theory that generic considerations are correlative principles of production and interpretation, we find a basis for understanding genre as praxis. If we understand reading to be isomorphic to authoring, it becomes clear that the reader can no longer be regarded as the self-evident recipient of text-signification. Genre, in Ricoeur's theory, transforms "speech" into a "work" and points toward a new notion of "reader" as one whose reconst~<br>

Author(s): Stevenson Walter J.<br>
Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Article Title: Ideology and Alienation: Theses on the Interpretation and Evaluation of Theologies of Liberation<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263710<br>
Date: 12 1, 1966<br>
Author(s): Winter Charles R.<br>
Abstract: Through the provision of a set of theses for the interpretation and evaluation of theologies of liberation, this paper attempts to mediate the existing conflict between academic theologians and theologians of liberation. It seeks to establish the legitimacy of theological discourse focused on the problem of alienation and liberation if carefully executed according to a clear set of guidelines. The paper begins with the argument that all interpretations of theologies of liberation must begin with an analysis of the theological genre within which these works fall. After insisting that theologies of liberation belong neither to the genre of systematic theology nor that of Christian social ethics, the paper develops the second thesis that theologies of liberation are best understood as members of a genre whose distinctive characteristics and functions are analogous to those intrinsic to secular ideologies. This thesis hinges upon a revisionist understanding of ideology drawn from the works of Clifford Geertz et al. and upon a careful specification of the generic similarities between the two forms of discourse. The second part of the paper moves from the level of interpretation to that of evaluation. It argues that theologies of liberation share with ideologies a tendency to occlude self-critical reflection. It suggests that a conscious recognition that theologies of liberation do not exhaust the possibilities of theological discourse but are relative models which select and interpret Christian symbols and doctrines in the light of the central dynamic of alienation and liberation might provide an antidote to this pathology. It maintains with Rosemary Ruether that there is no absolutely adequate model of alienation and liberation and that various models of alienation and liberation must be "interstructured" in order to overcome the perspectival biases of models which focus upon a single root of oppression.

Author(s): Williamson Tod<br>
Abstract: Using George Bataille's reflections on desire, death, and God as the basis for considering the love poetry of the Song of Songs as a manifestation of the commingling of separate realms and separate bodies in the service of a longed-for continuity helps us to see that such a commingling is never far from the domain of violence and that such continuity of being is never far from death. But the biblical book itself helps us to see something that is missing from Bataille's analysis-that is, a more complex understanding of the implications of desire for the divine. What if, contra Bataille, God were not "by definition" immune to risk? What if the divine were not understood to be perfection but, rather, bound as well to the vicissitudes of desire, with all the anguish and ecstasy that it implies? The Song of Song's lyrical presentation of Eros, carried over as it is into the tradition of allegorical interpretation, may, in fact, have rather profound implications for how we talk about God.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing Company<br>
Issue: i266364<br>
Date: 1 1, 1977<br>
Author(s): Willis Leo<br>
Abstract: This paper focuses on the need for educational researchers to recognise the dialectic between theory and method. A methodology described as quasi-historical and based on a theory of social action is discussed in the first section. The second section proposes a means whereby the meaning of actions can be understood. A schema for the interpretation of text evidence is then outlined. This schema or methodology draws upon the theoretical work of Giddens, Thompson and Habermas and the interpretation theory of Ricoeur. The proposed schema avoids a theory-method dichotomy and offers researchers a form of disciplined enquiry.<br>

Abstract: Hans Urs von Balthasar says: "The key to the understanding of God's action lies
exclusively in the interpretation which God gives of himself before man on the stage of
human nature .... What God has done for man is 'understandable' only in so far as it is
not understandable or justifiable from a human, worldly point of view, and from the
standpoint of our fragmentary knowledge: by these standards it is bound to appear 'fool-
ishness' and 'madness'" (Love Alone: The Way of Revelation [London: Burns & Oates,
19681 58).

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to rethink the much-discussed topic of the so-called crisis of orientation among, or shift of, Egyptian intellectuals who turned to Islamic subjects in the 1930s. Those intellectuals who, during the 1920s, had adhered to the principles of Westernization and secularization were said to have abandoned these principles to embrace Islam and Arabism a decade later. The commonly ventured historical account of this shift attempted to describe and explain it from the "top down," that is, from the perspective of the intellectual producers, either on the basis of content analysis of their texts or through the reconstruction of authorial intentions. It was assumed that the impact of this shift on the culture and politics of contemporary society could be extracted from the meanings invested by the authors in their texts or from the context of the act of writing. This paper approaches the subject from a different perspective, namely, from the "bottom up." While not ignoring authorial intentions or the meanings with which authors invested their texts, I emphasize the ways in which readers reinterpreted intellectual literature on Islam as they consumed it and argue that a proper understanding of the social and political impact of literary products cannot be attained without also understanding the reception of these products. I concentrate especially on one of the major representative texts of this shift, Muhammad Husayn Haykal's biography of the Prophet, and reconstruct the different interpretations of this work's major communities of contemporary readers in the discursive context of their different "horizons of expectations." Through recontextualizing the "crisis of orientation" debate in the paradigm of reader-response criticism and reception theory, the paper is intended to show that each community of readers produces an autonomous interpretation, "another reading." Despite differences among the various reading communities, some common features emerge f~<br>

Article Title: When Is Metaphor? The Idea of Understanding in Theories of Metaphor<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303096<br>
Date: 12 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Tourangeau Raymond W.<br>
Abstract: My purpose in this article is to describe how and why theories of metaphor vary in the ways they do. I argue that theories of metaphor differ precisely because they emphasize different temporal stages in the process of understanding metaphorical expressions. The different temporal points at which theories propose that a metaphor has been understood, ranging from the first milliseconds of processing to extended, reflective analysis, distinguish rival accounts of metaphor. In this respect, metaphor theories do not necessarily compete with one another, but can best be evaluated through an appreciation of the specific time-course that underlies metaphor understanding. My discussion reviews some of the major theoretical approaches to metaphor and reveals their (mostly implicit) assumptions about the time-course of interpretation. I suggest that most theories of metaphor draw unjustified conclusions about the entire time-course of metaphor understanding because of the particular temporal stage of understanding that each attempts to describe. Thinking about metaphor in terms of the time-course of comprehension should permit much of the theoretical pluralism presently seen in the multidisciplinary study of metaphor.<br>

Article Title: Metaphor: From Fixedness and Selection to Differentiation and Creation<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303096<br>
Date: 12 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Zinchenko Benny<br>
Abstract: By and large, most models of metaphor entertained in contemporary cognitive literature assume that metaphor is a relationship between two given entities whose attributes are defined prior to the relationship established between them. The metaphoric sense is produced through the selection of a subset of these attributes. In this paper I take issue with this view. My discussion is couched in the consideration of four basic cognitive assumptions: (1) the fixedness assumption, (2) the selectional assumption, (3) an assumption about the primacy of constituents over wholes, and (4) an assumption about meaning and interpretation. Against these assumptions I consider metaphors taken from literary texts, the semantics of non-metaphoric linguistic expressions, judgments of similarity, synesthesia, and patterns in both child development and the evolution of culture. An outline for an alternative view of metaphor is then presented, which is couched in the broader context of nonrepresentational psychology. In addition, the functional significance of metaphor is discussed and a pluralistic perspective on metaphor is proposed.<br>

Author(s): Skinner John G.<br>
Abstract: Recent challenges to traditional approaches and purposes for studying the history of political theory have raised questions about its constitution as both a subject matter and subfield of political science. Methodological arguments advocating what is characterized as a more truly historical mode of inquiry for understanding political ideas and recovering textual meaning have become increasingly popular. The relationship of these hermeneutical claims about historicity, such as that advanced by Quentin Skinner, to the actual practice of interpretation is problematical. Such claims are more a defense of a certain norm of historical investigation than a method of interpretation, and the implications of this norm for the reconstitution of the history of political theory require careful consideration.<br>

Author(s): Thiele Leslie Paul<br>
Abstract: To what extent and in what respects does the political though of Michel Foucault reflect the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas? In the September 1990 issue of this Review, Leslie Paul Tiele firmly asserted Nietzchean roots for Foucault's thought. In this Controversy, Thiele's claims are disputed by J. Scott Johnson. Johnson argues that Foucault's theory is rooted as much in Marx as in Nietzsche and that Foucault himself refuted Thiele's interpretation. In his response, Thiele takes issue with Johnson's critique.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: This paper provides a phenomenological account of the writing of a young woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. The method of interpretation is to put ourselves in the place of the author drawing upon a combination of sympathy, reason, common-sense, experience, and "an intersubjective world, common to us all" (Schutz, 1945: 536). The result is the recognition of the person as also capable of putting herself in the place of others so as to understand their behavior. This "role-taking success" identifies the limits of the current sociological understanding of insanity's significance in social interaction as an instance of "role-taking failure" (Rosenberg, 1992).<br>

Abstract: In this introduction to a selection of case studies on the theme "the past in music" I offer a few thoughts on the nature of the past and the role of memory in constructing historical narrative, with reference to the way in which these concepts have been theorized by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and ethnomusicologists. In reviewing the different ways in which echoes of the past can still be heard in the music of the present, I consider the capacity of music to evoke, embody and transform the past and, by so doing, to act as a medium for history and its interpretation.<br>

Abstract: The introduction to the symposium sets out a methodological framework for the apprehension of Southeast Asian rituals, languages, and literary texts so that they are at once open to cross-cultural comparative analysis and recorded in social and symbolic contextual detail. Philosopher Paul Ricoeur's use of the term "interpretation" is central here: he urges students of cultures to combine attention to structural features of language and culture (for example, grammatical patterns) with inquiries into social contextual features (for example, speech usage in real communities). Moving back and forth between the two sorts of analysis allows researchers to bring the insights of the one pole to the investigation of the other; the full hermeneutic process constitutes interpretation. This style of inquiry, a modification of the sort of interpretive social science developed by Geertz and Becker, allows Southeast Asianists to draw on careful ethnography to make crucial "course corrections" in anthropological and linguistic theory building in general.<br>

Author(s): Festa Roberto<br>
Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri~<br>

Publisher: M. E. Sharpe<br>
Issue: i20628279<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Curry Jane L.<br>
Abstract: In this article, the author uses the concept of "transitional justice"—defined as the way societies or groups elect to deal with the past as they establish a new system—to examine the manner in which political behavior in postauthoritarian states both manifests and modifies aggressor—victim memory. Comparing the cases of transition from authoritarianism to democracy in South Africa, El Salvador, and Poland, she contrasts the positive outcomes of the open confrontation with "silent memory" in South Africa with the failure of Poland and El Salvador, in different ways, to deal conclusively and consistently with the past. In the case of Poland, the initial silence turned the past into a political football that soured the citizenry on political participation. In the case of El Salvador, the author posits that "boomerang justice" stimulated by outside interests has split the population and alienated both sides from effective political action. The article thereby advances an interpretation of political behavior as a locus for collective memory in nation-states, with the conclusion for postauthoritarian states that transitional justice can free political behavior from the trappings of the past, but only if aggressors and victims confront one another and move toward reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: At its most a typical sports narrative records what happens in space and time. Alongside this traditional history of events there has emerged a research approach that might be called structural sports history. Its methods move in the world under the surface of facts, explored by researchers in ways that resemble archaeology. The aim is to uncover the changed human relationships and new forms of presence in sport-figurations of corporeality, space and time. Where the event-history approach recounts and recapitulates, the new approach works towards interpretation and understanding. These two are joined by yet a third element, the most intimate aspect of sports narratives: microhistory and the routes that it opens to the interfaces between the public and the private and the general and the particular, where the reader-oriented focus of the experiencing and narrating subject is necessarily foregrounded and at this point surface such elements of narrativity as the "confessional", the "meditative" and the "fragmentary" (auto)biography. The article describes different levels of a sports narrative and their conventions in qualitative sports research.<br>

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Abstract: Some literary theorists have suggested that the process of reading is a complex one and is central to the interpretation of texts. These theorists do not ignore the creation of texts or the authors' creative activities, but place special emphasis on the role of the reader. This approach has relevance for the study of the use of libraries. This paper offers an analogy between text and library and between reader and library user. The analogy is possible because both reader and user adopt intentional stances with regard to that which is to be interpreted and employ cognitive and affective means in interpretation. At the heart of this approach is a phenomenological-hermeneutical way of thinking that treats reading and library use as an event consisting of varying intention and interpretive possibilities.<br>

Abstract: Interpretation is central to the social scientist's process of analysis, regardless of whether that analysis relies on quantitative or qualitative data. This essay presents a "reconstructed logic" of the interpretation process involved in quantitative data analysis. Drawing upon a broad literature on interpretation, the paper shows how the interpretive processes for quantitative "data" has significant similarities to interpretation in other settings. For example, both qualitative textual analysis and quantitative statistical analysis rely upon contextual and topological paradigms, although the specific conventions differ in many respects. The process of play employed by musicians and actors in developing an interpretation of a piece of music or a dramatic role suggests ways in which the quantitative analyst might let data perform to help in arriving at appropriate interpretations of statistical results. The lines between quantitative and qualitative social science are less clear than often presumed. Both types of analysis involve extensive interpretation, and tools of interpretation that have many fundamental similarities.<br>

Author(s): Kane Anne E.<br>
Abstract: Though the process of meaning construction is widely recognized to be a crucial factor in the mobilization, unfolding, and outcomes of social movements, the conditions and mechanisms that allow meaning construction and cultural transformation are often misconceptualized and/or underanalyzed. Following a "tool kit" perspective on culture, dominant social movement theory locates meaning only as it is embodied in concrete social practices. Meaning construction from this perspective is a matter of manipulating static symbols and meaning to achieve goals. I argue instead that meaning is located in the structure of culture, and that the condition and mechanism of meaning construction and transformation are, respectively, the metaphoric nature of symbolic systems, and individual and collective interpretation of those systems in the face of concrete events. This theory is demonstrated by analyzing, through textual analysis, meaning construction during the Irish Land War, 1879-1882, showing how diverse social groups constructed new and emergent symbolic meanings and how transformed collective understandings contributed to specific, yet unpredictable, political action and movement outcomes. The theoretical model and empirical case demonstrates that social movement analysis must examine the metaphoric logic of symbolic systems and the interpretive process by which people construct meaning in order to fully explain the role of culture in social movements, the agency of movement participants, and the contingency of the course and outcomes of social movements.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i211059<br>
Date: 11 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Verheggen Theo<br>
Abstract: By studying Durkheim through a Schopenhauerian lens, the one-sidedly cognitivist and functionalist reception of his social theory can be balanced. Durkheim explicitly rejected such monistic interpretations. His dialectical approach was always aimed at an essentially dualistic perception of man and society, wherein the lower pole, the individual, is central. In Durkheim's symbol theory, this position leads to two kinds of symbols: those that are bound to the human body, here called "this and that" symbols, and those people can choose freely, here called "this for that" symbols. This twofold symbol theory can already be found in medieval philosophy (e.g. Dante Alighieri) as well as in the work of Paul Ricoeur. For Durkheim the human person is the symbol par excellence. By implication the rituals in which the person is (re)constructed, that is the rites of passage, should be central. The interpretation here opens up new perspectives for a more psychological interpretation of Durkheim's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The process by which a neophyte approaches a religious group has a particular interest. The importance of the relation between leader and followers is thus revealed. The symbolic manipulation of charisms is the fundamental instrument allowing to maintain leadership. The steps of conversion, testimony and prophecy are decisive. Thus the deep link between charism and word is unveiled: the talk involves different modalities in the use of the word, the final interpretation of whic is always given by the charismatic leader.<br>

Abstract: The article analyses the meaning of tattooing as a form of narration. Introducing the body as a text that can convey different forms of thought (derived both from philosophy and from sociology), the author maintains that the body modification is today as an open and living work whose interpretation has an influence on the individual identity and can be changed by means of the interaction with others. A thumbnail sketch of the history of the practice among traditional communities up to contemporary society is drawn to provide a series of fundamental usages for the inscription of the body. The concern here is to show tattooing as an expression of the whole individual (no longer divided into mind vs. body) and of his own perceived identity, underlying the relation of the chosen symbols (and of the symbolic ritual) with society, which remains the main source offering forms of representation and the main stage for the construction of identity. So that the whole final text can be read as the result of a process where the authorship is shattered among the society itself.<br>

Abstract: Research on information sharing has viewed this activity as essential for informing groups on content relevant to a decision. We propose and examine an alternate function of information sharing, i.e., the social construction of meaning. To accomplish this goal, we turn to social construction, social presence, and task closure theories. Drawing from these theories, we hypothesize relationships among the meeting environment, breadth and depth of information shared during a meeting, and decision quality. We explore these relationships in terms of the effects of both the media environment in which the group is situated and the medium that group members choose to utilize for their communication. Our study of 32, 5- and 6-person groups supports our belief that interpretation underlies information sharing and is necessary for favorable decision outcomes. It also supports the proposed negative effect of low social presence media on interpretation in terms of depth of information sharing; a low social presence medium, however, promotes information sharing breadth. Finally, the findings indicate that when in multimedia environments and faced with a relatively complex task, choosing to utilize an electronic medium facilitates closure and, therefore, favorable outcomes.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur has initiated a new direction in the field of hermeneutics by applying the phenomenological method to the interpretation of texts. By this he has effected a transition from description to hermeneutic phenomenology. In order to explicate his position the paper deals with this transformation: In developing hermeneutics Ricoeur tends to eliminate Husserl's transcendental idealism, to retain some central phenomenological motifs, and to add new elements. These elements were eclectically picked up by him from analytic and linguistic philosophy and from the current linguistic and structural theories. Since the deepest and most genuine roots of Ricoeur's thought lie in the phenomenology of Husserl, the paper concentrates on the explication of his phenomenological presuppositions and attempts to show how they were reformulated within the new science of interpretation. Thus, the first part of the paper is mainly an exposition of the transition from phenomenology to hermeneutics. The second part points to some difficulties inherent in such a move. The paper ends with a discussion of the problem of "the hermeneutic circle", which is an immanent part of hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: Jacques Derrida's deconstructionism has influenced some American shools of literary criticism which aim at abolishing the distinction between literary and philosophical texts and, at the same time, deconstructing the text from its inherent meaning. If no text has any determined meaning, every interpretation is as correct as any other. This article examines some tenets of Derrida and his followers, especially their definitions of the words understanding, interpretation, and difference. It finds some surprizing affinities between Kant's formalistic esthetics and certain formalistic trends in modern criticism, in particular the concept of autonomy, which implies, in deconstructionism, the uniqueness of every text. However, if so, every reading is inevitably a 'misreading' or 'misinterpretation' thereof. This has led to the paradoxical and unwarranted conclusion that reading is impossible... The article questions some eccentric implications of this paralogism, for example, if no text is readable, does this apply to Derrida's writings as well? The article also calls attention to some interesting concepts of Jewish Kabala and of 'negative theology', which bear a striking resemblance to certain of Derrida's and other deconstructionists' ideas. Without diminishing the importance of Derrida's philosohpical work or the contribution of deconstructionism to modern hermeneutics, this article refutes certain nihilistic claims of the 'deconstructors' regarding philosophical hermeneutics and literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: How do children conceptualise their own development? From their point of view, what serve as constraints for their movements in time and space? The theoretical framework of the experiment described here was a cultural historical first person developmental perspective. The concept of transition is here put in use to capture the children's experience of their movements with or against a dynamic, inviting and demanding socio-cultural landscape over time. An interpretation of children's experience of their developmental timing with temporalities of the childhood landscape is presented. Comment les enfants conceptualisent-ils leur propre développement? De leur point de vue, qu'est-ce qui contraint leurs mouvements dans l'espace et dans le temps? Le cadre théorique de la recherche décrite ici est une perspective historico-culturelle, développementale et à la première personne. Le concept de transition est utilisé pour mettre en évidence l'expérience que les enfants ont de leurs mouvements, allant avec, ou à l'encontre de leur environnement socioculturel et temporel, lequel est à la fois dynamique, invitant et exigeant. Une interprétation de l'expérience que les enfants ont de la temporalité de leur propre développement est présentée en rapport avec les temporalités caractérisant l'environnement de l'enfance.<br>

Abstract: Although the character of Job's wife has been given very little space in the biblical text of Job, she has been treated by many exegetes as significant. There are two main streams of interpretation in which she has figured prominently. In classical Christian approaches, ranging from Augustine to some modern commentators such as Habel, Job's wife tends to be regarded as a temptress in the mold of Eve and as a collaborator of the Satan. Post-modern, especially feminist, approaches tend to rehabilitate the character of Job's wife, accrediting her with prompting Job's critical reflection and with anticipating the direction in which the plot of the book develops. In the present article, interpretive approaches to Job's wife, including the favorable approach of some Jewish exegesis of antiquity, as well as the somewhat middle road of medieval Jewish exegesis, are surveyed. A critical discussion of feminist treatments of Job's wife deals primarily with the work of Newsom, Pardes and van Wolde. The place of Job's wife in the book is assessed with regard to how her theological views compare to those of the Satan on the one hand, and Job on the other, as well as to her role as a catalyst in the plot.<br>

Article Title: "I DON'T DO SYSTEMS": AN INTERVIEW WITH CLIFFORD GEERTZ<br>
Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23548454<br>

Author(s): GEERTZ CLIFFORD<br>
Abstract: I had the honor of interviewing Clifford Geertz at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, USA, on October 18, 2000. The interview focused on Geertz's theoretical conceptions, the tradition on which he draws, the critique he has encountered, and on interpretive anthropology's future development. Of particular interest was the clarification of his much-debated method, his definition of symbol and his famous definition of religion as a cultural system. Geertz emphasizes his attempt to exercise an applied pragmatic phenomenological and hermeneutical method without any general theory (or philosophy) of meaning, phenomenology, or culture. He maintains that he only has a conceptual framework inspired by different scholars, which nevertheless has consistent focus and perspective, i.e., meaning and symbol. In relationship to this, Geertz defines his symbol within the Peircean semiotic tradition. Therefore, the term symbol is understood as a sign (an index for example), which becomes a symbol via a cultural interpretation. Furthermore, his definition of religion as a cultural system is, in his view, a non-essentialistic definition and therefore is not—as Talal Asad claims—ethnocentric. Although it is Geertz's opinion that interpretive anthropology has been influenced by postmodernism, he predicts that interpretive anthropology's future development will be in reasonable continuity with its past. In my closing comments I tentatively suggest that Geertz may have a theory of interpretation because of his definition of the symbol, his unavoidable assumptions, and his unique method, which has the capacity of grasping the cultural specific in a general way.<br>

Abstract: CONTEMPORARY HUMANITARIAN CRISES UNDERSCORE WHAT HANNAH Arendt called the "perplexities" of human rights; the very category "refugee" attests the failure of the global rights regime. Indeed, the "abstract nakedness of being nothing but human" belies the "right to have rights." In light of this criticism, I offer a reconstructive, communitarian interpretation of the rights of the forcibly displaced. The grammar of rights, I argue, presumes the communicative virtues of respect and recognition of the "concrete other." I conclude by showing how biblical narrative "re-inscribes" stateless persons/strangers precisely as neighbor (Lev. 19:18, 33—34) in "anamnestic solidarity."<br>

Abstract: In 'Anti-Latomus' (1521), Luther defined the concept of metaphor from a Christological viewpoint, thus touching upon the relationship between the word of God and the word of man, theology and aesthetics. In his later work 'Vom Abendmahl Christi. Bekenntnis' (1528) an eschatological frame of reference determines his interpretation of the words of institution as metaphorical but real speech.<br>

Le présent article, fondé sur une interprétation de la correspondance diplomatique de Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, ambassadeur de France à Venise durant l'Interdit vénitien (1606-1607), étudie la survie de l'idée de Chré tienté au début du XVIIe siècle. À travers les lettres de Canaye de Fresnes, on peut voir qu'un usage catholique mais antiromain du concept de Chrétienté semble possible. A favourite assumption of the french historian Alphonse Dupront is the idea that the death of Christendom is a crucial element of european modernity. The present work, based on an interpretation of the diplomatic dispatches of Philippe Canaye de Fresnes, the french ambassador in Venice during the Venetian Interdict (1606-1607), deals with the survival of the idea of Christendom at the beginning of the 17th century. Through the letters of Canaye de Fresnes, one can see that a catholic but antiromanist use of the conceipt of Christendom seems possible.<br>

Abstract: »Die räumlichen und zeitlichen Schichten der Globalgeschichte: Überlegungen zu einer globalen Begriffsgeschichte anhand der Ausweitung von Reinhart Kosellecks Zeitschichten in globale Räume«. Recent debates on global history have challenged the understanding of history beyond the nation-state. Simultaneously, they search for non-Eurocentric approaches. This has repercussions on the relation between historical space and time in both historical interpretation and in research design. This article reflects on the possibilities of a global conceptual history by expanding Reinhart Koselleck's theory of temporal layers (Zeitschichten) into global spaces. To this end, it introduces the notion of spatial layers (Raumschichten). First, historicisation and its relation to and interaction with spatialisation and temporalisation is pondered; then, the impact of global spatial and temporal complexities on comparative and conceptual history is considered, before, thirdly, a framework of three tensions of global history - normative, temporal and spatial - is introduced as a way to concretely unfold historical research questions through global conceptual history. Regarding time and space, the main lines of argument in global history have focused either on the question of whether or not European powers were ahead of non-European ones or on the supposedly Western linearity of time as opposed to a non-Western cosmology or circularity of time. Taking its point of departure in Zeitschichten, which break from the linear-vs.-circular logic, this article instead proposes to foreground an actor-based, multi-lingual, global conceptual history to better understand spatio-temporal practices.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: This article explores the theological role of cities in Judaism as settings for the mediation between the heavenly and earthly realms. By way of juxtaposing the late antique city of Sepphoris and the modern settlement of Me'ah She'arim in Jerusalem, two understandings of this mediation will be studied dialectically. The differences and similarities between the two communities and their self-representation through urban architecture reveal the ways in which the highest religious symbols are manifested in the life of a city. They also unfold the transformation of modernity and the particular interpretation of a Jewish settlement it inspired.<br>

Abstract: Language and judicial activities are both signs of the existence of a society. There is, therefore, good reason for a dialogue between the science of language and the science of law. This article applies a linguistic theory of the Paris School (semiotics) to the examination of a legal text, namely a contract. The author points to some elements shared by legal and other texts, and demonstrates how a semiotic interpretation can provide interesting and unexpected insights into the deeper levels of a legal text. He concludes that a similar approach could fruitfully be used with other types of legal text.<br>

Author(s): Stein Herbert<br>
Abstract: Der gewichtigste Einwand gegen eine solche Interpretation geht von dem Anspruch der Psy-
choanalyse aus, eine Wissenschaft, ein wissenschaftliches Verfahren zu sein. Als solche und solches
behauptet Psychoanalyse sich, wenn auch nicht unangefochten, innerhalb der klinischen Medizin.
Gerade der kritische Angriff, der von naturwissenschaftlich ausgerichteten Medizinern und verhal-
tenstherapeutisch orientierten Psychologen ausgeht, verstärkt das Bemühen der Psychoanalytiker,
Psychoanalyse als Wissenschaft auszuweisen und zu erhärten. Um die Art von Wissenschaftlichkeit,
um welche es in der Psychoanalyse geht und gehen kann, gibt es unter den Analytikern Meinungs-
verschiedenheiten, kaum einer aber würde den Anspruch auf Wissenschaftlichkeit aufgeben. „My-
stisches" mit Psychoanalyse in Verbindung zu bringen, dergestalt, daß Psychoanalyse gar irgend-
wann und irgendwo in „Mystischem" gründe, muß als absurd, allenfalls eines Abwinkens wert er-
scheinen. Es schadet dem Ansehen. Zustimmung wird dort zu finden sein, wo man zur Meinung
neigt, immer schon gewußt zu haben, daß Psychoanalyse etwas Obskures sei. In dieser fachhistori-
schen Situation wird es schwer halten zu zeigen, daß, mit Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker zu spre-
chen, die „Anerkennung einer meditativen und mystischen Erfahrung.... wenn wir richtig argu-
mentiert haben, eine Konsequenz des Verständnisses des Wesens der Rationalität" darstellt (von
Weizsäcker, S. 480). Darüber hinaus weiß der Psychoanalytiker, daß er bei seinem Analysanden
Einsicht nicht durch argumentierendes Eingehen auf mancherlei Argumentationen erzeugt, sondern
durch die Möglichkeit von Erfahrung in einem Prozeß. Dies gilt dann aber auch für jene Elemente
eines Prozesses umwandelnder Erfahrung, welche über das klassische Selbstverständnis der Psycho-
analyse hinaus erreichen.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses Northrop Frye's biblical hermeneutic. Frye intends his interpretation of the Bible to be 'literary' (as opposed to theological) which for him means that it explicates how or why a poet reads the Bible. In so doing, Frye employs typology, believing that he is able to eliminate the theological elements of typology in his purely literary interpretation of biblical texts. However, a closer examination of typology itself shows that when it is applied to the Bible, as it is in Frye's writings, typology cannot be divorced from its theological foundations. Contrary to Frye's belief that his biblical hermeneutic is a non-theological interpretation of biblical imagery, I argue that Christian typology provides the inescapable framework for Frye's reading of the Bible.<br>

Author(s): Ward Bruce K.<br>
Abstract: The contemporary philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, has characterized the dominant trend in modern interpretative thought as the 'school of suspicion', whose most significant 'masters' are Freud and Nietzsche. For them, to seek meaning—whether in a text, dream, discourse, or institution—is, first and foremost, to suspect 'truth as lying'. It is my contention that Ricoeur could well have named Dostoevsky as a third master of this modern school of interpretation, for he, too, was preoccupied with exploring the possibility of 'truth as lying', whether to others or to oneself. The general concern of my essay is to clarify Dostoevsky's relation to the modern 'hermeneutics of suspicion' in a manner which is mutually illuminating. The particular focus is on Dostoevsky's hermeneutics of suspicion as employed in The Brothers Karamazov, especially with the object of deciphering the avowed 'love of humanity' which motivates Ivan Karamazov's famous 'rebellion' against God. Ivan's humanism is highly ambiguous, as his words and actions (of omission and commission) throughout the novel demonstrate. I attempt to show that the ambiguity of Ivan Karamazov can be illumined as an exercise of suspicion on Dostoevsky's part which distinguishes between the manifest sources of Ivan's moral stance and what is in reality its hidden basis. And, in order to situate Dostoevsky in relation to the modern 'school of suspicion', his interpretation of the ambiguous text of modern humanism is compared with that of Nietzsche. The dialogue which the essay sets up between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky on the problem embodied by Ivan Karamazov reveals areas of convergence and divergence: the former apparent in a shared suspicion of a secular humanism which affirms the love of humanity apart from religious faith; and the latter apparent in their different understandings of love—whether of humanity or of God. The comparison between Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, then, highlights the distinction between a hermeneutics of sus~<br>

Abstract: The following essay explores the nature of theory within the interdisciplinary space we call literature and theology—or more generally religion and literature—and the role theory has played in that space's collective practice. It argues that theory is natural to the 'binding' of religion with literature and of literature with religion, since both are caught in a dilemma of reading, including the 'reading' of the practices that mark each of their respective disciplines. The discussion then looks at the spectatorial nature of the ancient notion of theory as theoria, before it traces how theory, in moving from theoria to high Theory, has figured in the 25 volumes of Literature and Theology itself. This tracing covers a double assumption of theory and an appropriation of the 'other' as theory. The essay concludes by looking at the dynamic that continues to bind literature and theology, and indeed the readers of a journal such as this one, in a communality of theory, practice, and interpretation.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Author(s): Pellauer David<br>
Abstract: I offer some comments from the perspective of someone familiar with the work of Paul Ricoeur on Allan Bell's proposal that discourse studies take a hermeneutic turn drawing on Ricoeur's idea of an arc of interpretation. I suggest that such a hermeneutic turn would need to be more radical than Bell proposes in that he limits it largely to questions of method, without really addressing how it might affect our understanding of either the object of discourse studies or the goal of such studies. This does raise the question, however, whether discourse studies should be considered a subdiscipline of hermeneutical philosophy.<br>

Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Author(s): Tepe Peter<br>
Abstract: This article critically assesses Bell's attempt at transforming discourse analysis into discourse interpretation by means of hermeneutics as developed by Paul Ricoeur. If a hermeneutic turn is to take place in a discipline that proceeds according to the principles of empirical research, cognitive hermeneutics is the better option compared to Ricoeur's hermeneutics. Part I presents a short introduction to cognitive hermeneutics as developed by Tepe. Against this background, some central theses of Ricoeur's hermeneutics, on which Bell's approach is based, are discussed in part II.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Wodak Ruth<br>
Abstract: This article discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches in the humanities and social sciences which strive to analyse and understand, interpret and explain texts and discourses in systematic, qualitative ways. After reviewing some of the salient theories in the social sciences (such as objective hermeneutics and critical hermeneutics), I argue that critical discourse studies require a 'trichotomy' consisting of explanation, interpretation and critique. Other approaches such as Ricoeur's 'hermeneutic arc' seem to neglect important structural and material dimensions of context as well as critical self-reflection. Moreover, I argue that much intuitive and non-transparent speculation in Hermeneutics might be transcended if more historical, cultural, linguistic and philological knowledges would be systematically and explicitly integrated into the analysis of text and discourse, in a retroductable manner. The latter possibility is illustrated by applying an interdisciplinary framework to some brief examples (e.g. intercultural and historical translation studies; the discourse-historical approach in critical discourse studies).<br>

Author(s): van den Broek Paul<br>
Abstract: Text interpretation – the main interest of discourse analysts – is a central component of the text understanding process. In this article we introduce the Landscape Model, which describes the cognitive processes underlying reading comprehension in a detailed and precise manner. Moreover, this model captures the interpretative processes in which the human mind engages during reading. Within the context of the Landscape Model, we describe the relation between discourse understanding and discourse interpretation, and explain some of the phenomena that are central to the field of discourse analysis as seen from a cognitive perspective. In the first section we describe the basic cognitive processes that underlie discourse understanding, as captured by the Landscape Model. In the following section we illustrate the way that the Landscape Model can be applied to the work of discourse analysts. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the cognitive Landscape Model for the field of discourse analysis.<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: The nine responses to my focus article 'Re-constructing Babel: Discourse analysis, hermeneutics and the Interpretive Arc' are cross-disciplinary, as is the article itself. They come from discourse studies (Van Dijk, Billig, Wodak), cognitive science (Tepe, Yeari and Van den Broek, Van Dijk), Old Testament studies (Billig), hermeneutics (Pellauer, Scott-Baumann), history (Gardner) and literature (Pratt). I identify and address five main issues which I see these responses raising for discourse interpretation: the role of author intent and the original sociocultural context in interpretation; principles of translation, particularly in relation to the Babel story; issues of certainty and subjectivism in interpretation, again including the Babel story; the role and limitations of cognitive approaches, and the potential of images like 'unfolding the matter of the text' to be realized in teaching hands-on discourse work; and finally a call to new listening in the encounter with hermeneutics, as a route to freshening the field I like to call Discourse Interpretation.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Meir Ephraim<br>
Abstract: The article deals with the problem of revelation in Levinas' writings. The first part of the article analizes Levinas' ideas on the Same and the Other, more particularly the topics of the face and of discourse, as these come to the fore in the first section of Totality and Infinity. Investigating the non-totalising relationship between the Same and the Other presents us with the suitable framework for understanding the relation between the finite and the Infinite. Leaving out any ontotheological speech, Levinas shows how Metaphysics is enacted in the ethical relation. The second part cootinues with a description of Levinas' position on revelation in the Jewish tradition. The active Interpretation of Biblical texts "beyond the verse" represents an opportunity of hearing the divine word today and to enter into a more primordial Order than the Order of the Same. In the course of the article, we point to affinities and striking similarities between E. Levinas' and F. Rosenzweig's view on revelation. We also demonstrate how Levinas Orients his Jewish writings to his philosophy of the Other and vice versa. In writing on revelation, Levinas' main concern seems to be the description of the possibility of a fracture in the immanent order of totality and in the self-sufficiency of reason which is its correlative. This fraction is produced by the command "thou shalt not kill", calling the Same to open itself to the Other.<br>

Abstract: The article discusses the theoretical and methodological considerations as well as the practical application of two incarnations of the rhetorical turn in socio-cultural anthropology. Rhetorical turn is understood as a linguistie and constructivist turn, which marks a substantial part of contemporary thinking in the social sciences and humanities. Reflection about the relation between anthropology and rhetoric shows that the rhetorical turn is oriented on analyzing the rhetoric of anthropological texts, in their persuasive and figurative dimension. On the other hand, rhetorical turn refers to the research perspective in anthropology which is focused on the interpretation of society and culture in which an important role is played by the tools and concepts of rhetoric. Článek je věnován teoretickým a metodologickým úvahám, stejně jako praktické aplikaci dvou aspektů rétorického obratu v sociokulturní antropologii. Spojení „rétorický obrat” je zde použito pro lingvistický a konstruktivistický obrat, který významnou měrou poznamenal současný stav společenských a humanitních věd. Zaměříme-li se na vztah antropologie a rétoriky, zjistíme, že rétorický obrat s sebou přinesl úvahy o rétorice antropologických textů, o jejich přesvědčovacím a obrazném rozměru. Na druhé straně se rétorický obrat vztahuje k výzkumné perspektivě v antropologii, soustředěné na interpretaci společnosti a kultury, v níž hrají významnou roli nástroje a koncepty rétoriky.<br>

Abstract: L'article aborde la problématique herméneutique africaine par le biais de la phénoménologie, un courant philosophique contemporain inauguré par Husserl. Sans discuter le rapport spécifique à l'Afrique, il développe partiellement un programme qui pourrait s'intituler « la crise de la conscience africaine et la phénoménologie » et qui bénéficie aujourd'hui des progrès des études scientifiques africaines, précisément celles de Abdou Touré, sociologue ivoirien et Goran Hyden. Dans un premier temps, l'auteur expose le fondement concret de la démarche critique : c'est la crise africaine articulée au concept phénoménologique du monde de la vie. Dans un second temps, les résultats de cette explication sont illustrés à partir des ouvrages de Abdou Touré et Goran Hyden. Le premier démontre le caractère schizophrénique de la culture officielle ivoirienne et le caractère endogène antagonique du travail populaire spontané. Le second met en cause l'économie politique africaine en proposant le concept d'« économie de l'affection ». Cependant, la perception théorique de celle-ci n'a pas empêché l'auteur suédois de retomber dans l'eurocentrisme. Si elle évite ce genre d'écueil, la phénoménologie peut enrichir considérablement de son radicalisme critique le programme herméneutique, auquel Kwamé Nkrumah et Cheikh Anta Diop ont contribué de façon décisive. This article takes a new approach to African hermeneutical problematics by way of phenomenology — the contemporary philosophical current initiated by Husserl. Without touching on the specific relationship to Africa, it partially develops a proposition which could be called « the crisis of phenomenology and the African conscience », a programme which profits nowadays from the progress in African scientific studies as exemplified by Abdou Touré (a sociologist from the Ivory Coast) and Goran Hyden. In the first part, the author presents the concrete basis for his method : the crisis in Africa articulated in terms of the phenomenological~<br>

Abstract: This essay discusses Heidegger's interpretation of autobiographical narration in his lecture on Basic Problems of Phenomenology (WS 1919/20) as an alternative conception of authenticity. A focused comparison between Heidegger's early understanding of the 'narrated self' and the analysis of the call of conscience in Being and Time shows that the most problematic aspects of Heidegger's later idea of authenticity result from a distinct isolation of the authentic self, which is specific for his conception of authenticity since the mid-twenties. At last, the article intends to demonstrate that Heidegger's early idea of an original self-understanding is close to current philosophical theories which assume a holistic idea of authenticity and point out a strong relation between authenticity and narrativity.<br>

weg. In: Phänomenologische Forschungen 18 (1986). Studien zur neueren französischen Phäno-
menologie, 165 f.), wird die Relativität der Wahrheit, die „kein Historismus je hätte ahnen kön-
nen", von Levinas durchaus positiv bewertet. Derrida denke Bergsons Kritik des Seins und
Kants Kritik der Metaphysik zu Ende, so daß er die Möglichkeit einer ethischen Philosophie des
Begehrens eröffne (vgl. Emmanuel Lévinas: Ganz anders - Jacques Derrida. In: Ders.: Eigenna-
men. Meditationen über Sprache und Literatur. München 1988. 67 ff.). Zwar philosophiert Der-
rida aus einer ethischen Haltung der Verantwortung heraus, aber Levinas verkennt, daß für Der-
rida das theoretische Anliegen, den verdrängten Voraussetzungen des abendländischen Wissens
nachzuspüren, wichtiger bleibt denn eine theologische Ethik des Anderen.<br>

projiziert habe, und gegen die dialektische Philosophie fordert Wundt, daß sich die Psychologie
„endlich auf die Tatsachen selbst zu besinnen" beginne, „deren Interpretation ihre Aufgabe ist".
Das Theorem vom unbewußten Schluß führt er auf einen „naiven Logizismus" zurück, den er
v. a. Helmholtz zuschreibt. Dieser habe bei seiner Formulierung des Theorems (nach Wundts
eigener) zunächst nicht auf Schopenhauer, sondern vielmehr auf J. S. Mills Logik zurückgegrif-
fen. „Der Physiologe nimmt das verbreitetste Lehrbuch der Logik zu Hilfe, um sich über die
Psychologie zu orientieren! Wahrlich ein sprechenderes Zeugnis für die Herrschaft des Logizis-
mus könnte es kaum geben." (S. 14) Wundt verwirft so sein eigenes Theorem, von dessen Her-
kunft er zu schweigen vorzieht.<br>

Abstract: Der Horizont der Vergangenheit bildet nicht den Horizont an sich, wie das historische Be-
wußtsein ihn meint, sondern den vom Interpreten entworfenen Horizont. Gadamer anerkennt
die Bemühung um den Entwurf des historischen Horizontes. Der Interpret ist jedoch geschicht-
lich, so daß der Horizont derselben historischen Zeit, je nach dem Zeitalter des Interpreten, an-
ders entworfen werden muß. In Wirklichkeit gibt es allerdings viele hermeneutische Literatur, die
vom historischen Horizont spricht, als ob es ein objektiv und eindeutig zu bestimmender Hori-
zont wäre. So ζ. B. Wolfgang Pannenberg: Hermeneutik und Universalgeschichte. In: Zeit-
schrift für Theologie und Kirche. Bd. 60 (1963) S. 90—121, hier S. 116. Yoshio Hirako: Gadamä

Jr: Validity in Interpretation (New Häven 1967) p. 254. - Hirschs Hermeneutik, die im oben ge-
nannten Buch entfaltet wird, ist das genaue Gegenbild zu Gadamers Hermeneutik. Hirsch sagt,
daß der mit dem Gegenwartshorizont zu verschmelzende historische Horizont im voraus be-
stimmt werden müsse, damit die Horizontverschmelzung möglich sei. Der Textsinn selbst müsse
zunächst aufgefaßt und dann die Bedeutung zur Sprache gebracht werden, die der Textsinn für
den Leser hat. Dagegen lehnt Gadamer vom Standpunkt der geschichtlichen Endlichkeit des
Menschen aus den Dogmatismus von „Sinn an sich" ab (477) und stellt die Unterscheidung von
Sinn und Bedeutung in Frage. Hirsch versteht wegen seiner eigenen hermeneutischen Stellung
nicht, daß der historische Horizont es ist, der in der Erweiterung des Gegenwartshorizonts provi-
sorisch entworfen und am Ende des Verstehens aufgegeben wird. Vgl. Joseph J. Kockelmans:

Abstract: En este artículo se aborda la diversidad de tipos o dimensiones del discurso implícito. En concreto, se plantea una caracterización tipológica del mismo basada en las intenciones del productor del discurso, distinguiéndose cuatro dimensiones básicas: el discurso insinuado, el discurso ocultado, el discurso «fallido» y el discurso subyacente. Después de ofrecer ejemplos de cada uno de ellos, se sostiene la utilidad de la tipología propuesta para el análisis sociológico del discurso implícito, esto es, para su detección y su interpretación. This article discusses the variety of types or dimensions of implicit discourse. Specifically, a typological characterisation is proposed, based on the intentions of the producer of the discourse, including a distinction between four basic dimensions: insinuated discourse, hidden discourse, ‘failed’ discourse and underlying discourse. Some examples are provided of each dimension, and then it is held that the proposed typology is useful for the sociological analysis of implicit discourse, that is, for its detection and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: The ledger's collocation is ASV, Avogaria di Comun, 'Balla d'Oro', Reg. 162. In their studies of
the Serrata, Lane and Rösch state that lists of applicants for admission to the Greater Council man-
dated in a law of 1315 constituted rosters of the nobility, and as such were forerunners of the Libri
d'Oro begun in 1506. Crouzet Pavan, following the older interpretation of Maranini, makes a similar
statement. However, the requirement of the 1315 law, which is reproduced verbatim by Rösch, ap-
plied not to men actually admitted to the Greater Council but only to applicants; its purpose was to
provide the electors, who in 1315 still chose Council members, with a record of each year's self-
nominees to which they could refer during their secret deliberations. The lists, which have not sur-
vived, therefore did not constitute a record of the nobility's membership but only of men who aspired
to it. See Rösch, Der venezianische Adel, 178-9; Lane, 'The enlargement of the Great Council', 258;

Author(s): GRACIA JORGE J. E.<br>
Abstract: This article examines the relativistic view according to which the interpretation of texts is a matter of opinion and one interpretation is as good as any other. It clarifies the question by establishing precise understandings of texts and interpretations and by introducing various distinctions between different kinds of interpretations based on their function. It argues that not all kinds of interpretations are relativistic, although all interpretations are relative, and that even those interpretations that are relativistic are not so in the same ways.<br>

Author(s): STEELE MEILI<br>
Abstract: Although Ricoeur and Taylor are often grouped together, their conceptions of language, literature, and practical reason are very different. The first half of this essay focuses on Ricoeur's theory of triple mimesis and narrative, showing how his attempt to synthesize Kant, Husserl, and structuralism results in a formalism that blocks out the ontological, hermeneutical, and historical dimensions of literature and practical reason. The second half of the essay develops Taylor's ontological conception of public imagination and illustrates the dynamics of this conception of language and interpretation by showing how literary works debate with each other over language, subjectivity, and reference. Narrative does not just order; it argues.<br>

Abstract: As demonstrated by the workings of the political unconscious in Jean Toomer's Cane and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, investigation of authorial biography is an indispensable component of Marxist literary criticism. Symptomatic reading, while derogated by the advocates of "surface reading," remains crucial to textual interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Rethinking, 29, n. 120. I use the phrase in debating the views of Tamar
Chana Reich, "A Battlefield of a Text: Inner Textual Interpretation in the Sanskrit
Mahäbhärata," Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998:
"Granted we 'know' the Mbh as a text that 'grew, and became what it is by expan-
sion' (with italics), but not that it took eight 'centuries of textual production.'...
Reich [thinks the Mbh develops through] eight-hundred year[s]... of 'contestatory
discourse' governed by an 'aesthetic of expansion' (citing Reich 51, 32, and 31 suc-
cessively). This aesthetic better befits a short period of controlled, consensual 'con-
testation,' and also shared conventions, which do not last forever" - indeed, my
note goes on to show that "Reich sometimes points in this direction." It is in any
case the first thing I say in the book about conventions (353 [Index]).<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: Se revendiquant d'E. Betti dans le débat qu'il eut avec H.-G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman défend la possibilité de connaître avec certitude le sens objectif du Coran, qu'il dissocie du sens littéral. Ce sens objectif, qui correspond à l'intention divine, est pour ce réformiste indo-pakistanais en accord avec les valeurs universelles de la modernité. Or plusieurs intellectuels, dont le sud-africain Farid Esack, reprennent l'argument gadamérien de l'historicité de toute interprétation pour critiquer l'idée qu'une lecture puisse être objective. Ainsi, classique ou moderne, aucune interprétation ne serait dénuée de préjugés, et prétendre le contraire reviendrait à enfermer le Coran dans l'historicité du lecteur. Même si Rahman relativise son propos en rappelant la difficulté de la recherche de l'objectivité, le problème que pose son modernisme est qu'il risque de céder à l'illusion d'un islam véritable, authentique, qui arrêterait alors le mouvement de réinterprétation du texte. Taking a stand for E. Betti in the debate he had with H.G. Gadamer, Fazlur Rahman defends the possibility of knowing with certainty the objective meaning of the Quran, which differs from the literal sense. For the Indo-Pakistani reformist, this objective meaning, which corresponds to the divine intention, is in accordance with the universal values of modernity. Yet, many intellectuals, including South African Farid Esack, takes up the Gadamerian argument and plead for the historicity of any interpretation, criticizing the idea that an interpretation can be objective. In that view, be it classical or modern, no interpretation would be without prejudice, and pretending otherwise would confine the Quran to the historicity of the reader. Even if Rahman restates the difficulty of the search for objectivity, the problem of his modernism is that it may give the illusion of a real, authentic Islam, which then forecloses the dynamics of textual reinterpretation.

Abstract: In her interpretation of Freudian psychology Madelon Sprengnether conceives the figure of the spectral
mother as the recurrent metaphor of the presence of the absent, prompted by memory. The mother's body
becomes in his view the locus of desire and endless return; its loss the necessary step for ego formation: "The
mother's body becomes that which is longed for yet cannot be appropriated, a representative of both home
and not home, and hence, in Freud's terms, the site of the uncanny. As both origin and Other, the preoedipal
mother escapes the equally devastating effects of idealization and erasure, allowing for the possibility of maternal
discourse as well as a non-phallocentrically organised view of culture" (Sprengnether 1990, 9).<br>

Abstract: "Like a house's balcony, I overlook whatever I desire." At first glance, this line by the late Palestinian poet Mahmud Darwish may not seem to bear multiple or complex meanings. A daring attempt at interpretation, however, can show that this simple metaphor is capable of bearing and provoking various philosophical ideas. To achieve this end, the interpretation invites the ideas of several theorists of metaphor and imagery, including Bachelard, Derrida, Heidegger, Ricoeur, Nietzsche, and Deleuze, in approaching Darwish. «أطل كشرفة بيت، على ما أريد ». للوهلة الأولى، لا يبدو هذا السطر الشعري للشاعر الفلسطيني الراحل محمود درويش قابلاً لأن يحمل معاني متعددة أومعقدة. على أن محاولة أكثر جراة في التأويل قد تظهر أن تلك الاستعارة البسيطة قادرة على استفزاز أفكار فلسفية عديدة. ومن أجل الوصول إلى تلك الغاية، فإن التأويل الذي تقوم عليه هذه المقالة يستدعي أفكاراً لمنظرين متنوعين حول الاستعارة والصورة، بمن فيهم باشلار وهيديجر وريكور ونيتشه ودولوز .<br>

Abstract: Cet article se propose de tracer l'histoire de l'interprétation des rapports entre L'Ornement des Réalisations et les sūtra de la Parfaite Sagesse en Inde. On y examine quatre étapes de cette évolution: dans L'Ornement lui-même, chez les deux Vimuktisena, chez Haribhadra et chez Dharmamitra. L'enquête révèle que L'Ornement est d'abord à rapprocher des sūtra philosophiques non-bouddhiques qui entretiennent un rapport ambigu avec les textes fondateurs dont ils sont censés révéler le sens. Cette ambiguïté donne naissance à une tradition exégétique qui montre un constant effort de dé-textualisation aboutissant dans le commentaire de Dharmamitra à une élévation de L'Ornement à un statut égal à celui des textes mādhyamika et ainsi à une refonte de l'herméneutique bouddhique. This article aims to investigate the history of the interpretation of the relationship between The Ornament of Realizations and the sūtras of Perfect Wisdom in India. It shows four stages in this evolution: The Ornament itself, the commentaries of the two Vimuktisenas, Haribhadra, and Dharmamitra. This inquiry reveals that The Ornament should first be compared with non-Buddhist philosophical sūtras. These show a similar ambiguous relationship with the original texts they are supposed to explain. Such an ambiguity has given rise to an exegetical tradition displaying a continuous effort to de-textualize Perfect Wisdom, which results in Dharmamitra considering The Ornament to be equal to mādhyamika treatises and consequently in a general reevaluation of Buddhist hermeneutics.<br>

Article Title: The New Historicism of Stephen Greenblatt: On Poetics of Culture and the Interpretation of Shakespeare<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342982<br>
Date: 10 1, 1952<br>
Author(s): Shakespeare Jan R.<br>
Abstract: This essay on the much acclaimed critic Stephen Greenblatt deals extensively with the New Historicism he developed and for which he coined the name "Poetics of Culture." Contrary to many older interpretive methods and schools that tend to see historical and literary texts as autonomous entities, Poetics of Culture seeks to reveal the relationship between texts and their sociohistorical contexts. Cultural Poetics assumes that texts not only document the social forces that inform and constitute history and society but also feature prominently in the social processes themselves which fashion both individual identity and the sociohistorical situation. By means of an economic metaphor, Greenblatt explains how texts and other symbolic goods, by circulating in a society via channels of negotiation and exchange, contribute to the distribution of social energy, by which he means the intensities of experience that give value and meaning to life and that are also indispensable to the construction of self-awareness and identity. The beating heart, as it were, of this whole process of circulation is identified as a dialectics of totalization and differentiation, as a powerful social force that oscillates between the extremes of sameness and otherness. In several books Greenblatt has elaborated the various aspects of this Poetics of Culture, such as the circulation of social energy, the dialectics of totalization and differentiation, and the process of self-fashioning. This essay discusses some problems of this interpretive method and argues, in comparing it to a more traditional hermeneutics, that social energy, self-fashioning, and the earlier mentioned dialectic are only phenomena in Greenblatt's interpretation of texts and are not actual parts of sociohistorical contexts. Poetics of Culture, in spite of its radical claims, is a genuine hermeneutics operating in a more or less traditional vein.<br>

Abstract: De nombreux textes, à commencer par l'étude de Max Weber, ont déjà défriché le champ d'une sociologie de la musique et précisé à quels objets elle pouvait s'intéresser et comment elle pouvait les aborder. Le domaine, et l'appellation même, des musiques " populaires " demeurent toutefois problématiques. L'enseignement tiré de travaux des historiens de la culture conduit à les envisager comme " musiques de masse ". Pour les étudier, la sociologie peut les considérer comme un " fait sociomusical total " et y rechercher des représentations sociales, à la fois déchiffrement de la société par ses membres et moyens d'action sur elle. Une analyse tripartite modifiée, s'inspirant de la méthode proposée par Jean Molino et Jean-Jacques Nattiez et tenant compte des leçons de l'ethnomusicologie, peut fournir un cadre d'analyse général à partir duquel un très grand nombre de domaines s'ouvrent à l'exploration du chercheur qui y découvrira des mélanges infinis et, refusant de juger esthétiquement, s'attachera plutôt à expliquer le jugement esthétique des acteurs de ce " phénomène social total ". /// Several writings, starting with Max Weber's, have done pioneering work in the sociology of music. They have formulated the subjects to be studied and suggested how they can be approached. Many problems, however, remain. The lessons drawn from studies by cultural historians lead us to see it as " mass music ", which sociology can take to be a " total sociomusical fact ". The search can then be undertaken for the underlying " social representations ", which are both an interpretation of society by its members and a means of action on society. Modeled on the method proposed by Jean Molino and Jean-Jacques Nattiez, a modified threefold analysis taking into account the teachings of ethnomusicology, can help devise a general analytical framework that opens a large number of fields where sociologists will discover infinite mixtures. Refusing to make aesthetic judgements, they will seek to exp~<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>
Issue: i25165879<br>
Date: 12 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Libesman Heidi<br>
Abstract: The focus of this article is the theory of integration advanced by Alan Cairns in his book, "Citizens Plus: Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian State". Cairns' theory has had a mixed reception since its publication. Like much scholarship and public policy in the Aboriginal rights field, "Citizens Plus" has attracted strong proponents and opponents. At present "Citizens Plus" remains one of the primary competitors vying for influence in guiding the postcolonial reconfiguration of the relationship between Aboriginal peoples, the Canadian state and civil society on terms of justice that may be perceived as legitimate by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples. The prime alternative, as conceived by both Cairns and his critics, is the nation-to-nation constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The author provides a political theoretical reading of "Citizens Plus". She seeks to disclose the normative and conceptual structure of Cairns' argument and to situate Cairns' theory in the context of debates concerning the future of Aboriginal peoples and the constitution of Canada. This reading foregrounds an alternative interpretation of the relationship between "Citizens Plus" and the constitutional vision of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, which makes it possible to see them as complementary rather than opposed constitutional visions. The author also raises broader questions concerning the reasons for continuing the search, at the heart of Cairns' work, for a post-colonial theory and praxis of normative integration in diverse societies, and the conditions of the possibility of such a theory and praxis. Ultimately the author argues that whether one agrees or disagrees with Cairns' prescription, at a minimum "Citizens Plus" should be understood as raising a fundamental question to which multinational constitutional theory must respond. /// Le présent article a pour objet d'examiner la théorie avancée par Alan Cairns dans son ouvrage, "Ci~<br>

Abstract: Cognitive psychologists studying the reading process have developed a detailed conceptual vocabulary for describing the microprocesses of reading. Modified for the purposes of literary criticism, this vocabulary provides a framework that has been missing from most literary-critical investigations of the history of literate practice. Such concepts as the production of a coherent memory representation, the limitations of working memory span, the relation between online and offline reading processes, the landscape model of comprehension, and the presence of standards of coherence allow for close attention to general patterns in reading and to the ways that individual readers modify them. The interpretation of Victorian responses to the poetry of Robert Browning provides a case study in the adaptation of cognitive models to the history of reading. Such an adaptation can reveal not only reading strategies used by historical readers but also those fostered by the discipline of literary criticism.<br>

Abstract: La place de la musique dans À la recherche du temps perdu a suscité nombre de commentaires. Le présent propos connecte ces points à un débat interne aux musicologues français. Si certains l'envisage contre toute interpretation subjective, d'autres entendent la recentrer sur deux axes majeurs: 1) le statut d'écrit littéraire 2) révélant l'expérience musicale d'autre part. Or, de récents articles insèrent Proust à ce débat. Il s'agit de comprendre en quoi réactualiser écrivain ayant fait d'un roman un projet esthétique où la question du langage est centrale peut relancer la discussion du lien musique-langage, ici en un rapport où s'adjoint la musicologie, elle-même objet d'une dissension. /// The work À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust has provoked numerous commentaries which referred to the importance conferred upon music in this novel. In this, interest was pointed either at the music sources, the listening, or the connections between the architecture of the novel and the musical structure of the composer Vinteuil, the character in the novel. This article offers the articulation of those debates which occur within the French musicology which question its objects in the way that some consider it as a science or discipline at intersection of others, which has to return necessarily within sciences called exact and/or humane, opposed to all subjective interpretations; the other try to center again musicologist's activities in two main axes: the status of a writing with a literary aspiration on one side, and a report about musical experience on the other. In this, recent articles were putting Marcel Proust in the focus of a contemporary debate, trying to understand in which way the reactualisation of a writer - who out of one work had made an aesthetical project in which the question of language became central - can renew the discussion about connections between music and language, but this time within a triangular connection in which musicology is added, whi~<br>

Abstract: Lerner's interpretation is that as a result of the Fall, "humanity, in this act of
acquiring a higher level of 'knowing,' assumes the burden of distinguishing between good
and evil and of choosing the good in order to be saved"; but so far as humanity's newly-won
knowledge is, in part, sexual knowledge, the burden falls more heavily on the woman,
because God forbids her the "free and open sexuality of the fertility-goddess," symbolized,
at the time Genesis was written, by the serpent (The Creation of Patriarchy [New York: Oxford
UP, 1986] 196-97).<br>

Abstract: Il faut distinguer ici, comme le fait Susan Sontag, deux sens du mot "interpretation":
un sens general et un sens specifique. Voir Sontag parlant des theories d'interpretation de
type "agressif": "Of course, I don't mean interpretation in the broadest sense, the sense
in which Nietzsche (rightly) says, 'There are no facts, only interpretations.' By interpre-
tation, I mean here a conscious act of the mind which illustrates a certain code, certain
'rules' of interpretation" (5) ["Bien sur, je ne parle pas de l'interpretation dans son sens
general, a propos duquel Nietzsche dit (tres justement), Tl n'y a pas de faits, il n'y a que des
interpretations.' Par interpretation, j'entends ici un acte conscient de l'esprit qui illustre
un certain code, certaines 'regies' d'interpretation."]). L'interpretation du recit selon la
pensee chinoise qui est proposee ici s'entend dans le sens general du terme, comme lec-
ture possible, et non comme stricte grille hermeneutique.<br>

Publisher: University of North Carolina Press<br>
Issue: i344318<br>
Date: 6 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Williame Herman<br>
Abstract: The opposition between phenomenological sociology and Durkeimian sociology is not as absolute as it is often presented. The various ways in which Durkheim's work has been read by phenomenological authors throughout the last fifty years testify to a development toward greater proximity, implying changes in phenomenologists' interpretation of Durkheim as well as in their own starting points. Beginning with an exposition of one of the most antithetical stands towards Durkheim, the article points out different phases of the aforementioned development: (1) A more or less total opposition; (2) A positive view of the challenged that phenomenologists can find a Durkheim's work and an attempt to incorporate it into their own viewpoints without really changing the latter; (3) A simultaneous reinterpretation of Durkheim's sociologism and the pehnomenological notions of subjectivity and intentionality, on the common basis of a renewed insight into the corporeal character of human social phenomena.<br>

Abstract: Le titre de l'essai a deux significations: il fait allusion, d'un côté, à des lectures qui ont joué un rôle important dans le travail de Marcel Mauss sur le don (notamment, Bronislaw Malinowski et Franz Boas); de l'autre, à quelques lectures importantes qui ont été données de l'Essai sur le don. Les deux niveaux sont liés: l'un clarifie l'autre. Plus spécifiquement, l'essai montre que la réflexion sur le lien impliqué par l'obligation de rendre le don (thème qui est au centre de l'essai de Mauss) a été déclenchée par une lecture très originale de certains passages de l'Émile de Rousseau. Il suit les traces, directes et indirectes, de ce noyau rousseauiste dans la postérité de l'essai de Mauss: de l'interprétation de Hegel donnée par Alexandre Kojève aux lectures divergentes de Mauss données par Claude Lévi-Strauss et Claude Lefort — fondées sur, respectivement, une image non conflictuelle et une image conflictuelle de la société. The paper's title refers, on the one hand, to Mauss's readings for his essay on the gift (from Bronislaw Malinowski to Franz Boas); on the other, to some readings of Mauss's essay by others. The two levels are connected: the former clarifies the latter. More specifically, the paper argues that the reflection on the bond implied by the constraint to reciprocate the gift (an issue which is at the very center of the essay) is the outcome of Mauss's highly original reading of some passages in Rousseau's Émile. The paper follows the posterity, both direct and indirect, of this Rousseauian core in Mauss's essay and its readers, from Alexandre Kojève's interpretation of Hegel, to the divergent readings of Mauss's provided by Claude Lévi-Strauss and Claude Lefort—based on, respectively, a non-conflictual and a conflictual image of society.<br>

Abstract: It is also common to writers connected to the Cambridge school. Richard Tuck, for
example, in his recent and excellent Philosophy and Government 1572-1651 (Cambridge,
1993), provides a slightly different but nonetheless related account of the rise of a particular
set of political assumptions that created at least some aspects of the origins of contemporary
liberalism. Again, however, it is worth noting the similarity (in form, not content) of what
we might call the 'Straussian republicans' Mansfield and Pangle'. Mansfield begins his
account of the rise of the modern executive with Machiavelli, and in doing so explicitly
feels the need to distance his interpretation from that of Skinner and Pocock (see Mansfield,
Taming the Prince, pp. xxiii-xxiv), and the subtitle of Pangle's book is 'The Moral Vision
of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke'. As with Dunn and Skinner it is
with interpretations of Machiavelli and Locke that the critique of existing liberalism begins.<br>

It aims to shed light on the mystic-erotic paradigm, which underlies this work, as this paradigm is conceived in both the Judeo-Christian and the Greco-Roman traditions. In addition, attention is paid to questions concerning the interpretation and reception of the biblical text, as outlined in the hermeneutic work of Paul Ricoeur.<br>

Author(s): Wertz Howard R.<br>
Abstract: An existential-phenomenological description of everyday consumer experiences of contemporary married women with children is offered. An idiographic case study provides a thick description of this phenomenon and illustrates the hermeneutic process used in the interpretation. Following the case study, three interpretive themes are presented as mutually related aspects of an experiential gestalt that is shaped by the contextual ground of participants' life-world situations. Viewed holistically, the thematic aspects exhibit several dialectical relations that can be understood in terms of the emergent meaning of free choice. The applicability of this experiential gestalt to other life-world contexts is discussed.<br>

Abstract: In this regard the comments of Lévi-Strauss regarding Freud are of parti-
cular interest: "Our interpretation may take into account, and is certainly
applicable to, the Freudian use of the Oedipus myth... not only Sophocles,
but Freud himself, should be included among the recorded versions of the
Oedipus myth on a par with earlier or seemingly more 'authentic' versions"
("The Structural Study of Myth," pp. 92-93). As James A. Boon comments,
"This is to say that he is not treating the Oedipus-myth-in-relation-to-the-
experience-of-classical-Greeks. Rather, he is treating more generally various
efforts to come to terms with several sets of contradictions, such as 'how
one can be born from two.' Sophocles provides a version that can be
interpreted as such an effort; so does Freud." See From Symbolism to
Structuralism: Lévi-Strauss in a Literary Tradition (N.Y., Evanston, San
Francisco and London: Harper and Row, 1972).<br>

Publisher: Carfax Publishing, Taylor and Francis Ltd.<br>
Issue: i324979<br>

Author(s): Dube David<br>
Abstract: The essay challenges the strongly teleological emphasis in the construction of black South African literary history, which has elided many of the aesthetic, historical and political complexities of the literature. It argues that many of the literary texts written in the `mission' ethos are marked by forms of aesthetic hybridity and subtextual ambiguity which require serious interpretation. A common feature of this writing is its desperate struggle with a sense of accelerated time. It is suggested that written narrative was undertaken as a mode of reprisal which sought to limit and, in some instances, transform the effects of an alien modernity. This undertaking is studied in two groups of texts: those which tell the story of Christian `emergence' amongst indigenous communities, and those which re-create the traditional past. In the case of the `Christian' texts, the subtext is found to be more secular than is often assumed, with writers using the theme to develop an active relationship with the historical effects and ideological content of modernity. Similarly, narratives about traditional society (or early colonial encounters) involve attempts to relocate modern subjects in revised versions of the past, or to elicit principles around which alternative models of modernity or even civil society might develop.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i325622<br>

Author(s): Zeitlyn David<br>
Abstract: Some systems of divination are used to select particular sections of text, which are typically arcane and erudite, in which lies the answer to the particular, pressing problems of the client. Celebrated examples of such systems are the Chinese I Ching and the Yoruba Ifa. Werbner's work on Kalanga and Tswapong divination provides a case-study of the detailed praxis in such systems. Diviners have a multiple role when a divination technique selects a text. At each consultation they must satisfy themselves, their client, and their audience that they have followed the correct procedures to select the text. A second stage follows. The client has a particular question and the selected text was not composed as a specific answer to it. Interpretation is required to satisfy the client that the question has been answered. The diviner thus plays the role of indigenous critic, a role both similar to and different from that of literary critics in the Western tradition. The concept of `dialogic' used by Barber in her analysis of Yoruba praise poetry is taken to illustrate similarities and differences between diviner and critic.<br>

Abstract: The task of anthropology consists in describing and explaining cultures and ultimately reaching an understanding of them through interpretation. The practical difficulties of this are obvious to all those who have dealth with members of another culture. As Malinowski observed, the anthropologist's task is to be "the interpreter of the native." It is suggested that some of the principles elucidated in the philosophical discipline of hermeneutics, such as understanding in context as opposed to preunderstanding and the dialectical relationship between the interpreter and the object of interpretation, may be helpful in defining the essential problems that anthropologists may encounter in their attempts to interpret cultures.<br>

Author(s): Church Nathan<br>
Abstract: Lucy Bregman's approach to Schreber's "Memoirs" is scrutinized and found to be based on a number of fallacious and contradictory assumptions that call her interpretation of the book as personal religious myth into question. A social constructionist approach to mythology maintained by Berger and Luckmann is advanced, suggesting that at best Schreber's work qualifies as a quasi-mythical attempt to explain the source of his personal sociopsychic suffering. The family and interpersonal dynamics of Schreber's quasi-myth are investigated. Similarities to other cases of psychotic quasi-myths are noted and a general relationship between oppressive socialization and psychotic communications is advanced, as well as a specific alternative interpretation of Schreber's work to that proposed by Bregman.<br>

Abstract: By focusing on hermeneutics and dialogue, this article clarifies the distinctive contribution that pastoral and psychotherapeutic interventions have to make in the healing process. It is shown how the hermeneutical process discloses the meaning of events through the interpretation of texts that arise spontaneously in the lives of individuals and groups. Texts may range from individual fantasies and dreams to sacred histories recorded in scriptures. When the meaning of life events is explored in dialogue through symbolic texts, we term that process "dialogical hermeneutics." Effective dialogical hermeneutics requires the use of three techniques: (1) presence in the caring relationship, (2) dialogue toward meaning, and (3) offering alternative interpretation.<br>

Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i27643303<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Jackson Robert<br>
Abstract: This paper charts a policy shift within international and European inter-governmental institutions towards advocating the study of religions (or the study of religions and beliefs) in European publicly funded schools. The events of September 11, 2001 in the USA acted as a "wake up call" in relation to recognising the legitimacy and importance of the study of religions in public education. For example, policy recommendations from the Council of Europe and guiding principles for the study of religions and beliefs from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have been developed and are under consideration by member or participating states of both bodies. In translating policy into practice, appropriate pedagogies need to be adopted or developed. The paper uses the example of the interpretive approach to indicate how issues of representation, interpretation and reflexivity might be addressed in studying religious diversity within contemporary societies in ways which both avoid stereotyping and engage students' interest.<br>

Author(s): Wolseley Ronald N.<br>
Abstract: Narrative methods are used to analyze the cultural dynamics of civil society through a comparison of African-American and "main-stream" newspaper coverage of the Rodney King crisis in Los Angeles. The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.<br>

Issue: i27944903<br>
Date: 1 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): DERUCHIE ANDREW<br>
Abstract: According to the received interpretation, 'Der Abschied', the finale of Gustav Mahler's exotic and valedictory "Das Lied von der Erde", depicts the intrinsic subject's farewell to life and ecstatic, quintessentially romantic death. Cultural and anthropological historians of death, however, agree that by Mahler's day, encroaching modernity had rendered such a 'belle mort' a vanishing ideal. This article juxtaposes close musicopoetic and formal analysis against contemporary orientalist discourses to propose that 'Der Abschied' articulates a fresh epistemology of death whereby individual identity becomes subsumed in nature's eternal cycles. Laut der allgemein akzeptierten Deutung des Schlusssatzes von Gustav Mahlers exotischem Abschiedswerk, dem "Lied von der Erde", stellt 'Der Abschied' das Lebewohl des immanenten Subjekts an das Leben und seinen ekstatischen ur-romantischen Tod dar. Sich auf die Geschichte des Todes spezialisierende Kulturhistoriker und Anthropologen sind sich aber darüber einig, dass die fortschreitende Moderne bis zu Lebzeiten Mahlers das Ideal eines solchen 'schönen Todes' immer weiter schwinden ließ. Dieser Beitrag stellt eine detaillierte musikalische und poetologische Analyse neben zeitgenössische Orientalismus-Diskurse, um die These aufzustellen, dass 'Der Abschied' eine neue Erkenntnislehre des Todes darstellt, in der die Identität des Einzelnen in den ewigen Naturkreislauf subsumiert wird.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330145<br>
Date: 9 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Clifford James<br>
Abstract: Maurice Leenhardt's ethnographic work in New Caledonia spanned nearly half a century, from 1902-1948. The first part of this field research is described and analysed, as background to his later anthropological writings. Leenhardt's specific position as a missionary-ethnographer is discussed, its advantages and disadvantages weighed. A liberal missionary perspective is found, in this case, to be conducive to a portrayal of cultural process. Leenhardt's translation methodology and his relations with key informants are detailed. Transcription, the means by which ethnographic texts are constituted by more than a single subject, is speculatively extended to ethnographic practice generally. Field research may be seen as a collective, reciprocal endeavour through which textualised translations are made. This viewpoint calls into question common notions of description, interpretation and authorship in the writing of ethnography.<br>

Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330179<br>
Date: 3 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Spencer Jonathan<br>
Abstract: This article reviews the recent interest in the literary aspects of ethnographic writing, concentrating on the work of Geertz, Sperber and the authors associated with the collective volume Writing culture. While it is argued that serious questions are raised in some of this work, it is also argued that recent fashions in literary critical theory may prove unhelpful in addresing those questions. In particular, the tendency to read texts with little or no consideration for the social and historical context in which they were written seems an especially barren approach. Instead it is argued that anthropology is as much a way of working-a kind of practical activity-as it is a way of writing. Acknowledgement of the personal element in the making of ethnographic texts may help the reader to a better assessment of the interpretation on offer; more radical change requires a change in anthropological practice as well as in anthropological writing.<br>

Abstract: Muftis are literate scholars who specialise in Muslim legal-religious interpretation. They provide an example of a higher level of systematic indigenous interpretation than the common sense, everyday constructions of reality that have been discussed in anthropological accounts. I discuss the institutional form of the muftiship, and contrast it with the judgeship, with reference to indigenous ideal-types found in several categories of written Muslim social thought. This ideal form is then compared with the identities of historical and contemporary muftis in Yemen. The interpretive method employed by muftis joins a Greek-derived concept of analogy with recitation and hermeneutics. While their method is structurally similar to scriptural interpretation, muftis are worldly interpreters who address practical life problems posed by lay questioners.<br>

Abstract: This paper seeks further to define the processes of the interpretation of meaning in archaeology and to explore the public role such interpretation might play. In contrast to postmodern and poststructuralist perspectives, a hermeneutic debate is described that takes account of a critical perspective. An interpretive postprocessual archaeology needs to incorporate three components: a guarded objectivity of the data, hermeneutic procedures for inferring internal meanings, and reflexivity. The call for an interpretive position is related closely to new, more active roles that the archaeological past is filling in a multicultural world.<br>

Abstract: This Note reviews shortcomings and claims of discourse analysis (DA). In particular, it focuses on the relationship between DA and reflexivity. It argues that DA could not succeed as its supporters originally thought, because DA has not dealt adequately with the issue of reflexivity. Even now that has turned to such issues, DA has a limited interpretation of reflexivity that is related to the change in sociological focus from scientific beliefs and knowledge to the study of texts for texts' sake.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Author(s): Lin Yu-chen<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the drama of selfhood and the attendant problem of ethics in Brian Friel's Faith Healer. Drawing from the tenets of Freudian psychoanalysis, I scrutinize the protagonist's narrative identity through fissures created by the discrepancy between his story and the other two characters' versions. These crevices register the protagonist's post-traumatic affects for an uncanny home, which, intertwined with his equally uncanny talent to become the place of trauma, compels him to return time and again instead of acknowledging its loss. Symptomatically, in his fixation on an uncanny home in order to disavow its loss, the protagonist sutures his privation, to such an extent that he not only bars memory exchange with other characters, but appropriates them into a master narrative. Given the fact that the three characters' stories are addressed to invisible auditors who converge with the play's actual audience, the healer's final act of authority is limited as long as it is subject to the audience's interpretation of his memory narrative. In its appeal to the audience's decision on ethical justice for the healer's narrative imagination among multiple proposals, this play is an exercise of poetical ethics of memory.<br>

Abstract: Partant de l'analyse de la situation mémorielle actuelle, cet article diagnostique la question qu'elle fait naître pour la mémoire relative à l'esclavage dans les Antilles françaises, prise dans une frénésie qui renforce l'idée de mémoires soudainement inventées. Des mémoires de l'esclavage de l'ordre de la circulation intergénérationnelle sont-elles présentes? Cette question renvoie au débat anthropologique propre à ces sociétés où la mémoire collective relative à l'esclavage a longtemps été tenue pour être absente. À partir d'une recherche conduite sur un événement ancien qui reconduit le cadre du conflit originel entre maîtres et esclaves, à savoir l'insurrection de 1870 à la Martinique, l'article décrit les processus mémoriels qu'il a générés. Le recueil de témoignages auprès des descendants des insurgés rend compte de la présence de récits familiaux transmis jusqu'à aujourd'hui selon des modalités particulières liées aux conséquences de la répression de l'événement insurrectionnel. L'interprétation qui s'en dégage amène à revoir la question de la mémoire collective à la Martinique. Taking the analysis of the current memory situation as a starting point, this article analyses the question that it provokes about the memory of slavery in the French West Indies, subjected to a frenzy that reinforced the notion of spontaneously invented memories. Is there an inter-generational dissemination of slavery memory? This question refers to the anthropological debate in societies where collective memory about slavery has long been deemed absent. Using research carried out on an historical event that revives the framework of the original master/slave conflict, namely the 1870 insurrection in Martinique, we describe the memory processes this generated. The collection of accounts from descendentes of the rebels shows that family accounts have been transmitted until this day, using specific forms related to the consequences of the repression of the rebellion.

Author(s): James David<br>
Abstract: Grounded theory's popularity persists after three decades of broad-ranging critique. In this article three problematic notions are discussed-'theory,' 'ground' and 'discovery'-which linger in the continuing use and development of grounded theory procedures. It is argued that far from providing the epistemic security promised by grounded theory, these notions-embodied in continuing reinventions of grounded theory-constrain and distort qualitative inquiry, and that what is contrived is not in fact theory in any meaningful sense, that 'ground' is a misnomer when talking about interpretation and that what ultimately materializes following grounded theory procedures is less like discovery and more akin to invention. The procedures admittedly provide signposts for qualitative inquirers, but educational researchers should be wary, for the significance of interpretation, narrative and reflection can be undermined in the procedures of grounded theory.<br>

Abstract: L'exégèse biblique contemporaine associe une longue tradition herméneutique au développement moderne des sciences philologiques et historiques.

Dans leur diversité universitaire ou ecclésiale, les biblistes français ne participent pas moins au cours international et pluriconfessionnel de recherche. Où la théologie, momentanément séparée de la science positive, sert en fait d'aiguillon à la recherche historique et anthropologique. Et où en définitive, le texte, atelier de l'exégète, s'impose comme un vecteur de dépassement des vieux clivages de la science et de la croyance. /// The contemporary biblical interpretation associates a long hermeneutical tradition with the modern development of philological and historical sciences. Marked by the Separation of Churches and State, also by the "modernistic crisis" within Catholicism, this field of scholarship wonders today in France on its future and its part in the public space. Although connected with University or Church, the French biblical specialists do not take part less in the international and interdenominational research. The theology, temporarily separated from positive science, is finally stirring up historical and anthropological studies. At last for the scholar, Holly Scripture as workshop is used to overstep the old bounds of science and believe. /// La exégesis bíblica contemporánea asocia una larga tradición hermenéutica al desarrollo moderno de las ciencias psicológicas e históricas.

Date: 10 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Wogenstein Sebastian<br>
Abstract: The question how to situate Dea Loher's drama Manhattan Medea in the Medea reception serves as a point of departure for a discussion of imitation, originality, and the act of copying. In their dialogues, the characters Medea, as in Euripides' tragedy a refugee, and Velazquez, a security guard, reflect on originality and imitation. The article explores the theoretical and self-referential aspects evoked by these discussions and links them with a more general inquiry into the dimensions of interpretation in the arts. The question of originality and appropriation is expanded and problematized through focusing on radical social criticism voiced among others by the drag queen Deaf Daisy. In this context the article also examines the potential of performative signification encountered in Medea's deadly bridal gift, especially in light of Marjorie Garber's remark that "[w]hat gets married is a dress." Transgressive in its form too, Manhattan Medea combines tragic elements and those characteristic of comedy.<br>

Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30161639<br>
Date: 12 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Wiegmann Reinhilde<br>
Abstract: Hugo Friedrich's use of mostly negative terms for the description of modern lyrics in Die Struktur der modernen Lyrik (1956) results to a large extent from a static concept of metaphor as substitution and from an implicit acceptance of the "given order of things." Though Friedrich asserts that this terminology is descriptive rather than pejorative, it impacts his interpretation of poetry. Based on Paul Ricoeur's Die lebendige Metapher(1986), this article reexamines one of Friedrich's examples, Rimbaud's "Marine." This poem provides in exemplary fashion a depiction of the metaphoric process of creative, poetic metaphors: transformation as a succession of destruction and production in the realm of land and sea. The tension and play between sameness and difference inherent in the metaphoric paradigm reveals in "Marine" a dynamic process rather than a stable order violated as Friedrich's concept of similarity suggests.<br>

Article Title: Meta-Interpretation and Hypertext Fiction: A Critical Response<br>
Publisher: Kluwer Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i30204873<br>
Date: 2 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Gardner Colin<br>
Abstract: Traditional discourses upon literature have been predicated upon the ability to refer to a text that others may consult (Landow, 1994, p. 33). Texts that involve elements of feedback and nontrivial decision-making on the part of the reader (Aarseth, 1997, p. 1) therefore present a challenge to readers and critics alike. Since a persuasive case has been made against a critical method that sets out to "identify the task of interpretation as a task of territorial exploration and territorial mastery" (Aarseth, p. 87), this paper proposes the use of readers in an empirically based approach to hypertext fiction. Meta-interpretation, a method that combines individual responses to a text, reading logs, screen recordings and limited qualitative/quantitative analysis, and critical interpretation is outlined. By analysing readers' responses it is possible to suggest both the ways that textual elements may have influenced or determined readers' choices and the ways that readers' choices "configure" the text. The method thus addresses Espen Aarseth's concerns and illuminates interesting features of interactive processes in fictional environments. The paper is divided into two parts: the first part sketches out meta-interpretation through consideration of the main problems confronting the literary critic; the second part describes reading research aimed at generating data for the literary critic.<br>

Publisher: Transaction Periodicals Consortium<br>
Issue: i30224118<br>
Date: 4 1, 2001<br>
Author(s): Simons Karen<br>
Abstract: Willa Cather's famous Virgilian epigraph to My Ántonia alerts the reader to the novel's deep engagement with the Georgics. This paper advocates a positive interpretation of the relationship between the two by exploring the role of the poem in the life and "memoirs" of Jim Burden, the novel's narrator. In contrast to currently received notions about the poem's "pastoralizing" influence, it argues that the Georgics illumines the Nebraska prairie and the farmers who toiled there, enabling Jim to perceive and articulate their vitality and worth. Through Jim's story of remembrance and return, Cather ultimately presents the literary tradition, and the Georgics in particular, as a beneficent force capable of creating connections among human beings, the natural world, the past and present.<br>

Abstract: Mansell, in "Metaphor as Matter," writes, "It has been observed that metaphor seems always to
mean something that could (albeit with difficulty) be translated into a statement.... But metaphor
will never come into its own so long as it is thought of in this way. Interpretation actually leads away
from metaphor's strength" (p. 112).

Publisher: American Marketing Association<br>
Issue: i358168<br>
Date: 11 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Craig J.<br>
Abstract: The author describes and illustrates a hermeneutically grounded interpretive framework for deriving marketing-relevant insights from the "texts" of consumer stories and gives an overview of the philosophical and theoretical foundations of this approach. Next, the author describes a hermeneutic framework for interpreting the stories consumers tell about their experiences of products, services, brand images, and shopping. An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means-end chains laddering framework, the "voice of the customer" approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography. The author concludes with a discussion that highlights the types of marketing insights that can result from a hermeneutic interpretation of consumers' consumption stories and then addresses the roles creativity and expertise play in this research orientation.<br>

Article Title: The Artist's Intentions and the Intentional Fallacy in Fine Arts Conservation<br>
Publisher: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works<br>
Issue: i359233<br>
Date: 12 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Zumbach Steven W.<br>
Abstract: A formal claim was made in the mid-20th century that the goal of art conservation is to present the artwork as the artist intended it to be seen. Dispute over this claim among conservators and art historians involved differences of perspective on the relative roles of science and art history in the interpretation of artist's intent. A separate but concurrent debate among philosophers, art critics, and literary critics was sparked by publication of "The Intentional Fallacy," a scholarly article discrediting appeals to the intentions of artists and authors in art and literary criticism. In this separate debate, difficulty in the evaluation and application of artist's intent was traced to ambiguity of the term "intent." The author discusses 11 variations of its meaning and puts the issues surrounding artist's intent together in the contexts of art conservation. He also presents more recent viewpoints in the social sciences that associate issues of artist's intent with the role of the artist in the continued existence of the artwork. The writings of contemporary philosophers contribute useful perspectives on the essential nature of art and the autonomy of artworks from their creators. The author finds that the interpretation and application of artist's intent is an interdisciplinary task and that its evaluation in conservation contexts is limited to consideration of distinctive stylistic characteristics that demonstrate the correlated individuality of artists and their work. /// [French] Au milieu du 20e siècle, on prétendait que l'objectif de la restauration était de rendre aux oeuvres d'art l'aspect que l'artiste avait voulu leur donner. La controverse qui s'en suivit parmi les restaurateurs et les historiens d'art suscita des différences de considération sur les rôles relatifs de la science et de l'histoire de l'art dans l'interprétation de l'intention de l'artiste. Un débat séparé mais parallèle parmi les philosophes, les critiques d'art et les critiques littéraires~<br>

Abstract: On cherche dans cet article à sortir du débat antinomique opposant les partisans de la thèse substantialiste et les adeptes des théories constructivistes relativement à l'analyse de la nation comme lieu dit. À partir d'exemples puisés au cas québécois, moyen d'illustrer une argumentation beaucoup plus que de fonder empiriquement une interprétation, on tente de réconcilier les perspectives complémentaires d'une sémantique de l'action avec celles d'une pragmatique de l'action dans le cadre d'une théorie en devenir de la narraction. /// In this article we seek to find a way out of the antinomic debate pitting the advocates of the substantialist thesis against those who defend constructivist theories regarding the nation as a "place so named" (lieu dit). Using examples from the case of Quebec-with a view to illustrating a line of argument much more than establishing an empirical interpretation-we attempt to reconcile perspectives from a semantic of action with those from a pragmatic of action within the framework of a theory-inprogress of narraction.<br>

Abstract: Alors que de nombreuses réflexions ont été menées concernant le recueil des biographies ou le recueil des données statistiques longitudinales, fort peu a été écrit concernant la mise en œuvre de leur interprétation. Or, l'unité de ce champ de recherche repose précisément, d'après les auteurs, sur les principes spécifiques d'intelligibilité du social produits par l'interprétation des parcours de vie. Dans cette perspective, ils subordonnent la démarche fondée sur la distinction entre approches objectivantes " balistiques " et approches fondées sur le sens construit par les acteurs à une démarche fondée sur l'élaboration de formes temporelles de la causalité. Ils distinguent trois modèles de base: un modèle archéologique, un modèle centré sur les cheminements, un modèle structurel. /// Deep thought has already been given to the filing of biographies and longitudinal statistics, whereas, little has been written about the actual use of these interpretations. According to the authors, unity in this field lies in the specific principles of social intelligibility produced by the interpretation of the paths of life. With this in view, the process based on the distinction between objectivizing " ballistic " approaches and those based on actor-built meaning are subordinated to a process based on the elaboration of temporal forms of causality. Three basic models are made distinct: an archaeological model, a model axed on itineraries and a structural model. /// Wenn einerseits zahlreiche Ueberlegungen zur Sammlung von Biographien oder statistischen Längsschnittsdaten vorliegen, so muss andererseits festgestellt werden, dass wenig geschrieben wurde zur Handhabung ihrer Interpretation. Die Einheitlichkeit dieses Forschungsfeldes beruht jedoch gerade, wie die Autoren meinen, auf den spezifischen Grundlagen der Vertändlichkeit des Sozialen, als Produkt der Interpretation von Lebenswegen. In dieser Hinsicht wird die Vorgehensweise, die auf der Unterscheidung fusst zwischen " ballist~<br>

Article Title: Theory, Pragmatism and Truth: Post-Modernism in the Context of Action<br>
Publisher: University of Alberta<br>
Issue: i275803<br>
Date: 4 1, 1969<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: This paper criticizes post-modern and interpretive challenges to positivism by incorporating pragmatism into sociological theory. As an interpretive method, pragmatism is based on the notion that the meaning of ideas is to be found in their consequences for action in definite situations. In contrast to the post-modern "linguistic turn" in which language replaces activity, the pragmatist linkage of meaning to action points to the centrality of experience in realizing the mode of being projected by discourse. By stressing the interrelation of subject and object in definite situations, pragmatism avoids both the subjectivity inherent in the interpretive reliance on actors' perceptions and the false search for universal, abstract theory. The pragmatic emphasis on the consequences of ideas resolves the tension between relativism and objectivism in interpretation by its focus on theory and discourse as guides to action. /// Cet article critique les défis post-moderniste et interprétif au positivisme en incorporant le pragmatisme à la théorie sociologique. Comme méthode interprétative, le pragmatisme est fondé sur le principe que le sens des idées se retrouve dans leurs conséquences pour l'action dans les situations déterminées. Par contraste à la 'tournure linguistique' post-moderniste dans laquelle la langue remplace l'activité, la relation entre le sens et l'action suggérée par le pragmatisme indique la centralité de l'expérience dans la prise de conscience de soi projetée par le discours. En soulignant la relation réciproque entre le sujet et l'objet en situations déterminées, le pragmatisme évite la subjectivité inhérente dans la dépendance de la méthode interprétative sur les perceptions de l'acteur, ainsi que la recherche futile d'une théorie abstraite et universelle. L'importance que le pragmatisme porte sur la conséquence des idées résout la tension entre le relativisme et l'objectivisme de l'interprétation par sa concentration sur la théorie et le discours comme ~<br>

Abstract: The natural science model has fostered fragmentation among the human sciences, leaving them ill-equipped to address matters of public policy which demand more holistic approaches. This paper proposes a science of political ethics which could encompass factual, normative, and value materials. Ricoeur's processes of guessing, explanation, and comprehension are used to develop a theory of interpretation for the new science. The work of art is used as the metaphor for interpreting societal processes.<br>

Explica además el sentido en el cual la interacción social constituye un proceso de creación de significados, y por qué la interpretación de esos significados debe ser el propósito fundamental de las Ciencias Sociales. /// The article presents the constituent elements of an interpretive approach to Social Sciences. It begins by explaining why interpretive frames constitute an inevitable filter for our cognitive appropriation of the world that surrounds us and how metaphors (understood as a particular way of acquiring knowledge) can provide the principles that organize them. It also explains the way in which social interaction constitutes a process of creating meaning and why the interpretation of these meanings should constitute the fundamental purpose of Social Sciences.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369549<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Davidson Tor Egil<br>
Abstract: This article presents Peter Railton's analysis of scientific explanation and discusses its application in historiography. Although Railton thinks covering laws are basic in explanation, his account is far removed from Hempel. The main feature of Railton's account is its ecumenism. The "ideal explanatory text," a central concept in Railton's analysis, has room for not only causal and intentional, but also structural and functional explanations. The essay shows this by analyzing a number of explanations in history. In Railton's terminology all information that reduces our insecurity as to what the explanandum is due is explanatory. In the "encyclopedic ideal explanatory text," different kinds of explanation converge in the explanandum from different starting points. By incorporating pragmatic aspects, Railton's account is well suited to show how explanations in historiography can be explanatory despite their lack of covering laws or tendency statements. Railton's account is also dynamic, showing how the explanatory quest is a never-ending search for better illumination of the ideal explanatory text. Railton's analysis is briefly compared to, and found compatible with, views on explanation presented by David Lewis, C. Behan McCullagh, and R. G. Collingwood. Confronted with Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics and Donald Davidson's insistence on the indeterminacy of interpretation, the essay suggests that the objectivity of the ideal explanatory text should be regarded as local, limited to the description under which the action is seen.<br>

Abstract: Using life narrative interviews with Arab students with Israeli citizenship collected in 1997-98, I inquire into the processes and problems in talking about one's collective identity. In particular, I address how Arab students manage multiple identifications and the role of social relationships in shaping identity narratives. First, I argue that identity narratives do not voice a single point of view. Rather, identity narratives articulate multiple affiliations that, often, cohere in an uneasy fashion. Our identities are not incoherent, but such multiplicity provides the opportunity for talking about identity in novel ways. Second, I argue that social relationships are an integral part of identity stories that work to introduce, close off, balance, and rebalance possible self-identifications. In talking about identity, we narrativize our social relationships, and these narrated relationships are key points in the plotline of our identity stories. Drawing on this interpretation, I argue that social policies that equalize power relations and allow for the creation of social relationships based on mutual respect have the potential to shape identities that, without giving up valued affiliations, contain an acceptance of the other at their core.<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion, Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40000336<br>
Date: 3 1, 2004<br>
Author(s): Dhand Arti<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on one key episode of the great Hindu epic, the Mahābhārata: the scene in the first book in which the Bhārata widows Ambikā and Ambālikā are impregnated by their brother-in-law, Vyāsa. The article is composed of two parts. The first examines narratives surrounding the practice of niyoga, or levirate, and reflects on its significance to the construction of the epic plot. The second reflects on the personality and motives of Vyāsa, uncompromising brother-in-law, formidable sage, and near-divine author of the text. The link between the two parts is important for unpacking a key religious orientation of the Mahābhārata. The article argues that Vyāsa's curse of the Bhārata widows is not idiosyncratic but, rather, is a stern example of the author's specific interpretation of virtue, which in turn bespeaks the overarching religious worldview of the text--the karmayogic ideal of equanimity.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000755<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Gregory Eric<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a remarkable document that has escaped critical attention within the vast literature on John Rawls, religion, and liberalism: Rawls's undergraduate thesis, "A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith: An Interpretation Based on the Concept of Community" (1942). The thesis shows the extent to which a once regnant version of Protestant theology has retreated into seminaries and divinity schools where it now also meets resistance. Ironically, the young Rawls rejected social contract liberalism for reasons that anticipate many of the claims later made against him by secular and religious critics. The thesis and Rawls's late unpublished remarks on religion and World War II offer a new dimension to his intellectual biography. They show the significance of his humanist response to the moral impossibility of political theology. Moreover, they also reveal a kind of Rawlsian piety marginalized by contemporary debates over religion and liberalism.<br>

Author(s): Jung Patricia B.<br>
Abstract: An account of character is developed on the basis of Ricoeur's philosophy of the will. Particular attention is paid to the role of the bodily involuntary in the process of character-formation. This augments the interpretation of the moral meaning of sanctification developed by Hauerwas. When interpreted in light of corporeality, sanctification entails not only a perceptual transformation but also an affective change in the agent's value orientation, the competent retraining of the agent's emotions, and the gracious triggering of an adoptive disposition toward the agent's incarnate situation. Finally, the rootedness of character in embodiment, with the attendant problem of automatism, indicates the limits of the usefulness of an "ethics of character" for moral theology.<br>

Publisher: Scholars Press<br>

Date: 4 1, 1988<br>
Author(s): Gunnemann Jon P.<br>
Abstract: Accepting MacIntyre's teleological argument that the notion of individual rights is an invention or fiction, the article argues, against MacIntyre, that such a fiction may be interpreted as a creative response to the social requirements of modernity. Such rights language discloses the essential features of modernity but also the underlying teleological and moral structure of all human association. But whether rights language is perceived as a fall from morality or as a creative differentiation of moral language depends on a reading of history and especially on the interpretation of the Enlightenment project. Jürgen Habermas is used for an alternative reading of the Enlightenment and the relation of rights to the normative teleology of language itself. But both readings of history turn out to be theodicies, dependent upon hidden theological assumptions. Whether a society centered on a notion of rights can be governed by teleology can only be answered theologically.<br>

Article Title: Hermeneutics and Ethics: The Example of Reinhold Niebuhr<br>
Publisher: Religious Ethics, Inc.<br>
Issue: i40000905<br>
Date: 4 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): McCann Dennis P.<br>
Abstract: This essay explores the imaginative foundations of ethics, not by presenting a theory about the moral imagination, but by reconstructing the hermeneutic strategy underlying Reinhold Niebuhr's proposal for "an independent Christian ethic." The thesis is that Niebuhr's ethic cannot adequately be evaluated without careful attention to his hermeneutics, what he described as "the mythical method of interpretation." This point is argued first, by reconstructing Niebuhr's hermeneutics; second, by showing how his hermeneutics determines the strategy of his ethics; and third, by using this focus to clarify certain issues separating Niebuhr and some of his recent critics, specifically, William Frankena's criticism of his metaethics, Gene Outka's objections to his normative ethic of love as self-sacrifice; and John Howard Yoder's rejection of the strategy of his Christian realism as a whole. The essay is presented in the hope that Niebuhr's example will encourage American religious ethicists to explore the relationship between hermeneutics and ethics with greater intellectual sympathy and theoretical sophistication. The example of Niebuhr's "independent Christian ethic" is commended as one attempt to map the formal and substantive ways in which religious visions help shape our dispositions and moral choices.<br>

Article Title: The Anxiety of Inheritance: Reinhold Niebuhr and the Literal Truth of Original Sin<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000941<br>
Date: 4 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Rees Geoffrey<br>
Abstract: Widely regarded as the most influential proponent of the truth of original sin in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr worked hard to excise any "literalistic" element from his interpretation of the doctrine. In his attempt to "correct" the Augustinian tradition on original sin by purging it of all "literalistic errors," however, Niebuhr assumed as his starting point the most characteristically modern objection to the doctrine: that birth is a thoroughly natural, animal, and morally meaningless event. As a result, Niebuhr unnecessarily constrained his vision of the dimensions of human freedom, and hence his description of the dynamic of anxiety and freedom that energizes sin. Through a careful reading of Reinhold Niebuhr's writings on original sin, in light of the truth that the end of human life is inseparable from its origins, a reappraisal and recovery of the meaningfulness of the assertion of original sin as a literal inheritance is possible. The result of such a reappraisal and recovery is an amplified insight into the existential anxiety that Niebuhr otherwise described so convincingly.<br>

Author(s): Pettigrove Glen<br>
Abstract: This paper explores the relation between understanding and forgiving. A number of people have argued against the old adage that to understand is to forgive, for in many instances understanding leads to excusing rather than forgiving. Nonetheless, there is an interesting connection to be found between forgiving and understanding. I identify three ways in which understanding can lead to forgiveness of unexcused wrongdoing: It can do so by changing our interpretation of the actor, by changing our interpretation of the action, and by engaging self-love.<br>

Issue: i40013929<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo apresenta o pensamento mais recente de P. Ricoeur sob a perspectiva de uma lógica da produção de sentido, discutindo criticamente as possibilidades e os limites do círculo hermenêutico. Tomando como ponto de partida os pressupostos fenomenológicos e ontológicos da sua filosofia, são sucessivamente abordadas as questões relativas à interpretação textual, imaginação e criatividade, acção, tempo e narrativa, ideologia e utopia. Reconhecido um certo logocentrismo - uma mistura de Logos e de suposto real - implicado na solução destas questões que nos é proposta pelo autor, procura-se repensar a ligação entre o sentido e o consensus, a coerência e a própria questão da violéncia. Estabelece-se para isso, na última secção, um confronto entre as posições defendidas por Ricoeur e a hipótese de R. Girard sobre o desejo mimético e a violência. /// Cet article présente la pensée la plus récente de P.

Abstract: Vale a pena voltar a analisar a relação entre o mal e a religião em Kant. Mas este artigo aborda a problemática prévia a esta questão, isto é, a própria questão do mal tal como Kant a apresenta na primeira parte do livro de 1793, A religião nos limites da simples razão. Depois da introdução que elucida o espanto dos primeiros leitores deste livro, procura-se, na base da análise hermenêutica dos textos, verificar a articulação entre a disposição originária para o bem e a propensão para o mal. Encontra-se em seguida a aporia da relação entre o desejo e a realidade do mal: de onde provém o desejo do mal moral? Será preciso, no itinerário desta resposta, elucidar o conceito de natureza, bem como a relação com a interpretação kantiana do pecado original. A conclusão volta a introduzir a questão da liberdade na compreensão do mal, numa espécie de tensão pós-kantiana entre moral e metafísica. ///Il convient de réanalyser la relation entre le mal et la religion chez Kant. Le présent article aborde cependant une problématique préalable á celle-ci, á savoir la question meme du mal telle que Kant la présente dans la première partie du livre de 1793, La religion dans les limites de la simple raison. Après l'ntroduction qui rappelle 1'étonnement des premiers lecteurs de ce livre, on essaie, sur la base d'une analyse herméneutique des textes. de discerner l'articulation entre la disposition originaire pour le bien et la propension au mal. On rencontre ensuite l'aporie entre le désir et la rélité du mal: d'où vient le mal? Sur l'itinéraire de cette réponse il faudra éclaircir le concept de nature, ainsi que l'interprétation kantienne du péché originel. La conclusion réintroduit la question de la liberté dans la compréhension du mal, en une sorte de tension post-kantienne entre morale et metaphysique. /// The relation between evil and religion in the philosophy of Kant deserves e renewed analysis. The approach this article takes, however, is to begin by treating a prior problematic~<br>

Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy is most well known for its phenomenology of interpretation in the Geisteswissenschaften or humanities. It moves Heidegger's ' As–structure ' of understanding through an appreciation of the primacy of questioning to the dialogical structure of interpretation as mediated by language. This phenomenology grounds a linguistic ontology, which rehabilitates metaphysics as a renewal of the tradition of a metaphysics of light, without transgressing the limits of phenomenological accessibility. The result is a metaphysics of finitude that is undogmatically open to the infinite. At the heart of this linguistic ontology is the speculative structure by which language-in-use is related to being in a way that overcomes all kinds of representationalism and of naive picture-thinking (including empiricism and idealism). Hans-Georg Gadamer's ontology is postmodern yet genuinely metaphysical. /// A filosofia hermenêutica de Hans-Georg Gadamer é particularmente conhecida pela sua fenomenologia da interpretação no âmbito das Ciências do Espírito (Geisteswissenschaften). Pela importancia que dá à primazia da interrogação, Gadamer transforma a estrutura heideggeriana do como da compreensão numa estrutura dialógica da interpretação mediada pela linguagem. Esta fenomenologia fundamenta uma ontologia linguística, a qual constitui uma rehabilitação da metafisica sob a forma de uma reactualização da tradição que é a metafisica da luz, mas sem contudo transgredir os limites impostos pela acessibilidade fenomenológica da questão. Daí resulta uma metafisica da finitude aberta ao infinito de forma não dogmática. No centro desta ontologia linguística está uma estrutura especulativa segundo a qual a linguagem-uso se relaciona com o ser de forma a que todo e qualquer tipo de representacionalismo ou pensamento-imagem (onde se incluem tanto o empirismo como o idealismo) seja superado. O artigo visa, pois, demonstrar até que ponto a ontologia de Hans-Georg Gada~<br>

Abstract: Descartes atribui enorme importância aos três sonhos que teve na noite de São Martinho de 1619, que liga directamente ao descobrimento da sua via científica, quer no Discurso do Método, quer nas Meditações. O presente estudo procura compreender filosoficamente este episódio onírico e a autointerpretação cartesiana, numa perspectiva filosófica, que une referências históricas e psicanalíticas, mas encontra a sua fenomenologia na projecção extática do tempo e na experiência da dualidade. /// Descartes describes the three dreams he dreamed the night of Saint Martin 1619 as a most important episode in relation with the discovery of his method and system, as he says in the Discours de la Méthode and in the Méditations. The present paper aims to understand them in a hermeneutical and phenomenological way, without forgetting the relevance of the psychoanalytical and historical interpretation. The clue to the dreams is founded in the ecstatic projection of time and in the experience of dualism.<br>

Author(s): Welsen Peter<br>
Abstract: The systematic relevance of the arguments Schopenhauer directs against Kant's categorical imperative has hardly been discussed in detail so far. As the difference between Kant's and Schopenhauer's moral philosophy amounts to the opposition between practical reason and sympathy, it is anything but surprising that it is reflected by Schopenhauer's objections. Schopenhauer tries to show that practical reason - be it in its pure or empirical form - is altogether incapable of furnishing a solid basis for ethics. To assess the import of this thesis, a detailed examination of the aspects of practical reason that provoke Schopenhauer's critique is necessary including: 1) the identification of morality and reason; 2) the moral value of maxims; 3) the categorical imperative; 4) the prescriptive character of Kant's approach; and 5) his ethico-theology. Although some of Schopenhauer's arguments are based on misunderstanding, his interpretation of the categorical imperative as an expression of rational egoism seems convincing. /// A relevância sistemática dos argumentos que Schopenhauer dirige contra a doutrina kantiana do Imperativo Categórico quase não tern sido objecto de discussão. O autor do presente artigo considera que tal como a diferença entre a filosofia moral de Kant e de Schopenhauer se reduz à oposição entre razão e simpatia, não é motivo de surpresa verificar que ela está reflectida nas objecções de Schopenhauer. Este, com efeito, tenta mostrar que a razão prática - seja isso na sua forma pura ou na sua forma empírica - é totalmente incapaz de fornecer uma base sólida para a ética. Em ordem a captar a importância desta tese, o artigo propõe um exame detalhado dos aspectos da razão prática que suscitam a crítica de Schopenhauer, entre os quais se inclui necessariamente: 1) a identificação de moralidade e razão; 2) o valor moral das máximas; 3) o imperativo categórico; 4) o carácter prescriptivo da abordagem kantiana; e 5) a sua teologia ética.

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Article Title: The Narrative Ethics of Leopold's Sand County Almanac<br>
Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40014552<br>
Date: 10 1, 2003<br>
Author(s): Liszka James Jakób<br>
Abstract: Although philosophers often focus on the essays of Leopold's Sand County Almanac, especially "The Land Ethic," there is also a normative argument present in the stories that comprise most of the book. In fact the shack stories may be more persuasive, with a subtlety and complexity not available in his prose piece. This paper develops a narrative ethics methodology gleaned from rhetoric theory, and current interest in narrative ethics among literary theorists, in order to discern the normative underpinnings of the stories in Part 1. The narrative ethics approach sidesteps the need to ground the land ethic in ethical theory—which has been a reconstructive and problematic task for the philosophical interpreters of Leopold—and suggests, instead, that it emerges in Leopold's very effort to narrate his, professional, personal, and practical experience with nature. The involves examining the stories in terms of their emotional, logical and performative aspects. The result is an analysis that shows not only how these stories express normative claims, but also justify them. One conclusion of the analyses is that, in the narratives, there is less emphasis on the problematic notion of an over-arching "community" than in the prose pieces, and more emphasis on the metaphor of other living things as "fellow travelers" in the "odyssey of evolution." Second, the narratives take on an ironic attitude toward the ecological order, less discernable in the prose essays. The order itself may not be ethically admirable, but should be preserved since it makes possible any ethical relations within it. Thus, the narrative reading suggests some temperance to the usual holistic interpretation of his land ethic and its concomitant criticisms especially the charge of ecofacism. We should not take the land ethic imperative at its face value, in the sense that the good of the order itself is an intrinsic good. In the narratives, individuals are shown not merely to be means to the ecological whole,~<br>

The minor thesis follows from the main one: the Western phenomenological tradition and Lithuanian philosophy interact and develop in tandem with one another. According to the authors, the contact between poetics and philosophy is the dominant form of phenomenology in Lithuania. The phenomenological tradition is treated as creative and living philosophical thought.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Abstract: Périodiquement, une voix philosophique ou une autre s'élève pour promouvoir Wittgenstein figure tutélaire des sciences sociales. Concrètement, bien que son nom soit attaché à quelques épisodes célèbres, les usages de Wittgenstein, en anthropologie notamment, restent cependant assez modestes. Mais, philosophe à la fois viennois et anglais, susceptible ainsi de se charger des effets de prestige et de disqualification associés à la philosophie analytique ou continentale, il n'en est pas moins un révélateur intéressant des échanges intellectuels dans l'anthropologie entre les États-Unis et la France. Si les effets de censure semblent à présent l'emporter en France, aux États-Unis, le travail récent et original de Veena Das, autour de la lecture par Stanley Cavell de Wittgenstein, trouve de nouvelles pistes d'inspiration dans cette œuvre apparemment austère. /// Periodically, a philosophical voice is raised to tout Wittgenstein as an outstanding figure in the social sciences. Although his name is associated with a few famous episodes, his ideas have been put to little use, at least in anthropology. Although the figure of this philosopher, both Viennese and English, is apt to take on the traits of prestige and disqualification associated with analytical or continental philosophy, it is a telling example of intellectual exchanges in anthropology between the United States and France. While censure seems to have carried the day in France, Veena Das's recent, original work in the United States on Stanley Cavell's interpretation of Wittgenstein opens new sources of inspiration in this apparently austere work.<br>

Article Title: Mysticism and Sprachkritik: Martin Buber's Rendering of the Mystical Metaphor 'ahizat' enayim<br>
Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40019046<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Urban Martina<br>
Abstract: In his early interpretation and representation of the oral teachings of the Hasidic masters, Martin Buber engaged in issues pertinent to the critique of language (Sprachkritik,) of the fin-de-siècle. Associated pre-eminently with Fritz Mauthner and his circle, the critique of language (Sprachkritik) questioned the epistemological status of language, wedded as it is to the divisive Erfahrungswelt. By drawing attention to ecstatic speech, which paradoxically gives expression to the experience (Erlebnis) of the ineffable unity of existence, Buber adumbrates a solution to the cognitive limitations of language. Refracted through Lebensphilosophie, he distinguishes between language as bound to Erfahrung and speech as nurtured by Erlebnis. Whereas language is propelled by conceptual and propositional forms of cognition, speech, principally sustained by metaphors evoked by an experience of the noumenal. Through an examination of his interpretive translation of a well-known Hasidic parable, this article explores how he amplifies this distinction by means of a semantic transformation of the key mystical metaphor of 'ahizat ' enayim (lit. seizing the eyes). Discerning the hermeneutical layers of Buber's rendition of the parable, we argue that his own ambiguous propositional casting of the metaphor entraps him into the very problem he sought to overcome. /// O presente artigo tem como ponto de partida o facto de que na interpretação e representação que dos mestres do Hasidismo fez logo na primeira fase da sua actividade como intelectual, Martin Buber assumiu como próprias questões especialmente pertinentes para uma crítica da linguagem (Sprachkritik) típica da época fin-de-siècle. Associada de modo particular a Fritz Mauthner e ao seu círculo, a Sprachkritik interrogava-se sobretudo acerca do estatuto epistemológico da linguagem, conectada como ela estava com uma Erfahrungswelt que era, desde logo, fonte de divisão. Nesse sentido, a autora do artigo defende que ao chamar a aten~<br>

Abstract: The intention of the article is to demonstrate the dialectical relation of self-understanding and understanding of the Other within ethnological interpretation. Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Abstract: The impact of modernity, the recognition of which was central to ethnographic testimony, has been challenged by self-referential cultural criticism. A growing awareness of cultural representations has been advocated within the frame of narrative ethnology. This shift towards understanding and interpretation is pointing not only to an ethnographic dialogue, as it has been suggested, but also to cultural relativism. Furthermore, as a result of conflicting interpretations, there has been a tendency to overemphasize the diversity of cultural identities. Instead of hallowing relativistic claims for "readability," more realistic attempts have to be made towards complex situations facing the intricacies of contemporean modern life.<br>

Author(s): Kululuka Apollinaire Anakesa<br>
Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40026609<br>
Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Klein Michael L.<br>
Abstract: This article discusses irony both as a narrative archetype in tonal music and as an interpretative strategy on the part of the listener. Beginning with a discussion of Northrop Frye's four narrative archetypes (romance, comedy, tragedy, irony), the article turns to a semiotic interpretation of the archetypes by James Liszka and an application of that work for music analysis by Byron Almén. Arguing that ironic narratives in tonal music often take as their premise a topical field associated with romance or comedy that leads to an unexpected failure, the article also claims that our interpretation of musical narratives must be invested in the semantic level (topics, codes, conventions, genres) as well as the syntactic one (harmony, voice leading). The four archetypes function as structures of the musical text and as master signifiers that the listener uses to organize an interpretation. As such, the archetypes function as ideologies of the musical text and as ideologies of the reader. The article illustrates these ideas with analyses of Chopin's Nocturne in B, op. 32/1, Chopin's Second Ballade, and Brahms's Rhapsody in Ek op. 119/4.<br>

Abstract: Framed in the introduction and conclusion by an analysis of U. S. Congressional hearings about Hurricane Katrina and its socio-political aftermath, this article explores the theo-political significance of narrative in order to give a feminist theological interpretation of political participation and personhood. It attends to and expands on the role of narrative at the intersections of moral philosophy, feminist theory, sociology, and public and women's liberation theologies, retrieving key insights from these sources to highlight some of the heretofore neglected implications of subaltern narratives as an alternative form of political engagement in U. S. public life. Especially when viewed through a richly textured feminist, womanist, and mujerista theological lens, this article provides a theological perspective on narrative as one rhetorical practice of public engagement utilized by marginalized groups for prophetic justice. It concludes by showing how a feminist<br>

Issue: i40030281<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Gosselin Gabriel<br>
Abstract: Expliciter les fondements d'une éthique des sciences sociales engage hors d'une sociologie de l'éthique. C'est une recherche peu pratiquée dans ces disciplines qui conduit nécessairement à des affirmations en première personne, et entraîne des présuppositions épislémologiques. Trois postulats sont ici dégagés : 1 / Reconnaître en tout autre un sujet, c'est admettre que le sujet est seul porteur de sens ; 2 / L'affirmation d'une commune humanité introduit une universalité en valeur et une relativité épistémologique, dans une démarche interprétative et une éthique des limites ; 3 / Dire que ce n'est pas l'ordre qui nous constitue, mais nous qui le constituons, c'est dire le risque éthique de nous concevoir comme les éléments d'un Tout, et c'est supposer un individualisme d'ordre épistemologique. Accurately defining the basis of an ethic of social sciences requires an approach which is outside the sociology of ethics. The little amount of research which has been conducted in these fields has necessarily led the author to present personal assertions and has also resulted in epistemological presuppositions. Three assumptions are presented here : 1 / To consider that any one else is a subject amounts in effect to admitting that only the subject carries a real meaning ; 2 / The assertion that mankind is a common whole is introducing both the concept of universality and an epistemological relativity, through an approach based on interpretation and an ethical understanding of limits ; 3 / To state that society does not legitimate ourselves, but that ourselves legitimate society amounts to drawing attention to the ethical risk of considering ourselves as lhe components of a whole, which is presupposing an individualism of an espistemological nature.<br>

Author(s): Gonthier Frédéric<br>
Abstract: La notion wébérienne de « compréhension » ne se réduit pas à la continuité cognitive que réclament aujourd'hui les « sociologies compréhensives » entre connaissance ordinaire et connaissance scientifique. Elle s'élucide au contraire dans les notions qui appartiennent à son extension logique : le sens subjectivement visé, Vinterprétation rationnelle et l'explication causale. On analysera ici ces trois notions coextensives, de même que les différentes formes de circularité qu'elles entretiennent dans la sociologie wébérienne. Weber's notion of « understanding » cannot, as claimed by comprehensive sociologists, be understood simply as cognitive continuity between ordinary knowledge and scientific knowledge. Rather, it must be logically extended, taking into account subjective meaning, rational interpretation and causal explanation. The article analyzes these three coextensive notions, as well as the different forms of circularity they create in Weber's sociology.<br>

Abstract: The history of literary studies is especially important today as Germanistik takes account of its institutionalization in the university and redefines its disciplinary boundaries. By analyzing the two best-known reform universities, Berlin in 1809/10 and Constance in 1966/67, I show their strikingly similar commitments to notions of scholarship/research, learning, and pedagogy. That these common concerns are based on the influence of hermeneutics is not surprising; the philosophy of Bildung and Wissenschaft central to educational theory for Humboldt in Berlin, as well as for Jauß's and Iser's Rezeptionsästhetik in Constance, is metacritical and encourages reflection on understanding and interpretation.<br>

Abstract: Ce travail analyse l'usage du mythe bolivarien dans l'histoire du Venezuela dans la longue durée, suivant l'approche de l'histoire des idées et des sensibilités et jusqu'à prendre en compte l'imaginaire politique de la République bolivarienne. Il montre qu'au-delà de la chronologie consacrée par les historiographies de l'indépendance et patriotique surgissent des thèmes et des passions souvent oubliés par l'histoire académique, aujourd'hui récupérés par l'histoire officielle. C'est dire la nécessité de dresser une esquisse « opportune » du héros, en laissant de côté les faits pétrifiés voire sanctifiés. Desde la perspectiva de la historia de las ideas y de la historia de las representaciones, este trabajo intenta analizar el uso del mito bolivariano en la historia de Venezuela, ubicándolo en el tiempo largo hasta llegar al imaginario político de la «República Boüvariana». Muestra cómo, más allá de la consagrada cronología independentista y de la historiografía patria, asoman temas y pasiones muy a menudo olvidados de la historia académica aunque si rescatados por une nueva historia oficial. De ahí la necesidad de llegar a un boceto «oportuno» del héroe, dejando de lado hechos petrificados y hasta santificados. This essays aims to analyze the use of bolivarian myths in Venezuelan history from point of view of the history of ideas and representations. So its focuses on long term interpretation in order to emphasize the political imaginary of Bolivarian Republic. It points out to the fact that, along with Independence consecrated chronology and homeland centered historiography, come up matters and passions frequendy forgotten by academic history but recovered by the new official history.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40039166<br>

Author(s): Lee Sherry D.<br>
Abstract: Early twentieth-century Viennese modernity, obsessed with identity in crisis, was especially preoccupied with the play between external appearances and internal dimensions of the self. This is the context for Alexander Zemlinsky's opera Der £ werg, which stages the tragic tale of an ugly, misshapen individual who does not recognize his own mirror image. The fatal end to his encounter with his reflection speaks to the devastating consequences of the limits of self-knowledge. While multiple conceptions of recognition— ranging from self-identity to the need for acknowledgement by others— have become increasingly prominent in recent literary, philosophical, and political discourses, theories of recognition have rarely played a role in the interpretation of operatic works. Here, the engagement with Zemlinsky's opera, and the Oscar Wilde text on which it is based, is framed and informed by the multivalent concept of recognition, which illuminates both the thematic and the structural workings of the music and libretto, while reflecting productively on the wider personal and political dimensions of their cultural contexts.<br>

Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: This article contemplates a succinct historical, systematic and critical examination of practically the whole of Ricoeur's philosophical writings. It gives a summary of Ricoeur's philosophy (Part I), collects the scarce elements of his metaphysical perspectives (Part II) and ultimately makes a tentative endeavour to gauge the possible nature and meaning of his still unfinished philosophy. 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF RICOEUR'S PHILOSOPHY The first section discusses the necessity and the possibility of a provisional parenthesizing of the fault and the Transcendence. A purely intelligible and phenomenological analysis of the will can according to Ricoeur only refer to a purely intelligible noema of will, viz. to the fundamental possibilities of human will. Therefore the author desires a provisional suspension of ir-rational evil and mythic innocence and consequently of the meta-rational Transcendence. This methodical and doctrinal decision dictates the threefold structure of his will-philosophy : an eidetic and existential description of the neutral will-structures (an eidetics of will), a description of and a reflection on concrete guilty existence (a symbolism and empirics of evil will), and finally the metaphysical, poetic reflection on fallen man fascinated by a personal and creative Salvation (a poetics of will). The historical and psychological background of this twofold neutralization is formed by young Ricoeur's strong resistance against the disastrous results (absurdity of human existence and agnosticism) of an originally supposed „ontologization” of culpability with Kierkegaard, Jaspers and Heidegger. The second section commences with the pure, Husserlian eidetic description of the voluntary and the involuntary : willing implies a decision from bodily motives, a carrying out with the help of the body and all this on condition of agreeing with the necessity in and outside man. However, as a result of notional splitting up and ideal aloofness inherent in noematic analys~<br>

Abstract: In this paper a distinction is made between two conceptions of the ego in freudian metapsychology. According to the first conception, a conception which Freud never gave up, the ego is conceived as a specific function on the surface of the living organism ; it is the result of a progressive differentiation of the Id ('Es') under the driving power of internal stimuli and external reality. Fitted with specific neutral, i.e. non-conflictual functions as perception, memory, control of the bodily motions and consciousness, the ego has to defend the individual as a biological living organism against the threats from without and within. In this conception the ego is treated as an instance that doesn't take part in the different psychic conflicts. We analyse the philosophical presuppositions and show the metapsychological disadvantages of this hypothesis that has been worked out especially in the American ego-psychology. According to the second conception, that takes into account important clinical pheno mena as identification, idealisation, narcissism, ideal of the ego, the ego is conceived as a metaphorical effect of a specific psychic act. With Lacan, we try to analyse and to interpret this specific act as an act that causes an infinite splitting in the ego : the ego is constituted as a subject that from its origin is separated from itself. Instead of being a biological function that lives in the immediate metonymical prolongiation of the living organism, it rather has to defend a certain representation of himself. This point of view doesn't exclude a purely functional description of the ego ; but the different functions have now to be interpreted differently because the ego is the effect of conflicts in which it takes part (consciousness is interlaced with unconsciousness, perception with denying...). In the last part of our study we show how Freud makes the philosophically important distinction between the ego as an object of the Id and the ego as a subject that has to~<br>

Abstract: What do historians do when they interpretate the past ? Narrativists hold that they organize factual statements into a meaningful whole, the story, which itself has nothing to do with past reality. Others, like David Carr and Paul Ricoeur, defend a relation between the narrative whole and the experience of time. An altogether different approach to the question of the unity of history is that of Johan Huizinga. Huizinga does not place the meaningful unity of history in the text, but in the aesthetic conception of the past. The past is not like a reservoir of signs, which acquire meaning by being put in a self-invented order, nor is it a story-like structure which can be interpretated and translated like a text. History is a cultural reality which we experience as full of symbolic meaning. Interpretation is the search ofthat meaning. The centre of historical conciousness is not in the story, but in the mental imageswe create when we see historical objects, search through documents or read a historians interpretation. In this article I try to clarify Huizinga's concept of the „historische sensatie“ by relating Huizinga's ideas to those of the Dutch writer Lodewijk van Deyssel. Secondly I try to show how the imagination of the (past) world can be regarded as a fundamental form of truth by confronting Huizinga's ideas with those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Vincent van Gogh.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical philosophy as developed by Heidegger and Gadamer is not compatible with the classical phenomenological programme elaborated by Husserl. The hermeneutical stress on historicity as a necessary condition for understanding is unfamiliar to Husserl's strictly theoretical approach. However, this does not mean that a hermeneutical philosophy as such cannot be conceived in a phenomenological sense. Whether or not hermeneutical philosophy is phenomenological depends on the paradigm chosen for hermeneutical explanation. A hermeneutics referring to the interpretation of texts may elucidate constitutional elements of phenomenology, e.g. phenomenological reduction and reflection. In this way it even can initiate a modification of phenomenology which, instead of being caught up in its subjective foundation, now appears as elucidating the openness of the correlation between intentional attitudes and their 'objects'. For this correlation the interpretation is a paradigm, whereas the openness of the correlation can be explained in respect of freedom, language, and time.<br>

Abstract: The short novel, Will-o'-the-Wisp ('Het dwaallicht') by the Antwerpian (Belgian) author Willem Elsschot, narrates how one night Laarmans, a somewhat tired middle-aged husband and father, accompanies three Afghan seamen on a search for a woman, Maria Van Dam. The search leads them through the harbouring city, and ultimately fails. The work is enigmatic and invites the reader to engage with it creatively, adventurously and not without commitment. The reader discovers in this way not only what it means to interpret, but also that by questioning one's own contribution in the understanding of being, interpretation serves as a challenge to clarify one's existence. The enigma of Will-o'-the-Wisp is never solved, but the search for understanding what happened during that nightly search provides a model for every practical methodology of hermeneutics, and can therefore be considered a parable about the nature of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Abstract: La définition kantienne du Gewissen associe deux schèmes interprétatifs anciens, celui de la voix et celui du tribunal, pour produire une invention dont le présent article essaie de mesurer la portée en même temps qu'il fait de cette réélaboration critique un vecteur de lecture des interprétations contemporaines. De manière presque inaperçue, c'est-à-dire sous l'apparence d'un héritage passivement transmis, Kant nous lègue un des problèmes les plus difficiles pour la philosophie pratique, celui de conférer du sens à la conscience morale. The kantian definition of Gewissen establishes a link between two lines of interpretation, one which draws on the simile of voice and the other on the metaphor of court. Through discussions of contemporary commentators, this article shows that the kantian definition deeply transforms the notion of Gewissen. In very discrete manner, in the guise of inheritance, Kant bequeathes us one of the most difficult problem of moral philosophy that is how to give meaning to moral consciousness.<br>

Article Title: Somatic Apprehension and Imaginative Abstraction: Cairns's Criticisms of Schutz's Criticisms of Husserl's Fifth Meditation<br>

Abstract: Dorion Cairns correctly interprets the preconstituted stratum of Edmund Husserl's Fifth Cartesian Meditation to be the primordial ego and not the social world, as was thought by Alfred Schutz, who considered Husserl to be insufficiently attentive to the social world's hold upon us. Following Cairns's interpretation, which involves recovering and reconstructing strata that may never exist independently, one better understands how the transfer of sense "animate organism" involves automatic association, or somatic apprehension. This sense-transfer extends to any animate organism, not just humans, and draws on extensive unreflected-upon similarities despite the distinctive fact that the other's body is never given to oneself as is one's own. Following Cairns's interpretation, one can also understand the second epoché as an imaginative, reconstructive abstraction rather than as an example of failed ascesis. Consequently, Husserl appears as less intellectualized in his approach to empathy than often thought to be and more confident in the phenomenologist's capacity to imagine and attend selectively to experience.<br>

Article Title: Stanley Cavell on Modern Music: "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It" after Forty Years<br>
Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i40044259<br>
Date: 4 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Cox Franklin<br>
Abstract: Cavell's influential mid-1960s critique of the "new music" of the postwar era poses significant challenges for contemporary composers who value this music. As with postmodernist critics, he has ably identified shortcomings in justifications for recent modernist music. With the benefit of time, however, the distance between Cavell's and the postmodernists' views concerning subjectivity and the role of the arts in defining it have become increasingly clear. In Cavell's scenario, a contemporary listener or critic confronted with the new music faces a sort of existentialist crisis: he or she is unable to individually affirm the value of a music that conforms to no recognizable models for music yet accepts the fact that this music is, according to Cavell's model of modernism, the fruit of an inexorable historical development. Cavell's interest in this dilemma stems. from the wider aims of his philosophical project, particularly his focus on the perils of the nihilism he finds evident in deterministic and mechanistic theories of the arts. In this light, in both "Music Discomposed" and "A Matter of Meaning It," Cavell appears to be using new music primarily as a vehicle to articulate his concerns and to criticize formalist theories of artistic interpretation, such as that of Wimsatt and Beardsley. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of an effort on Cavell's part to engage this music with the same seriousness that is evident in his writings on modernist authors and visual artists. Toward the end of the article, attention is drawn to the ethical responsibility, given the situation Cavell has sketched, for a critic of the modern arts to make a commitment, either to an existing modern music or to a possible future music.<br>

Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Abstract: Three different methodologies exist to analyse data which is in the form of verbal texts. They are content analysis, the Glaser-Strauss constant comparative method of grounded theory, and text interpretation in the hermeneutic tradition. This article briefly reviews content analysis and the constant comparative method. More detailed instructions for text interpretation, for which relatively few explicit specific directions exist in the literature, are developed. The appropriate use of each methodology is discussed.<br>

Publisher: Institute of English and American Studies, University of Debrecen<br>
Issue: i40057449<br>
Date: 4 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Gross Robert F.<br>
Abstract: The Play About the Baby remains neglected by interpreters of Albee's work because its austerely schematic mode of presentation seems to keeps everything on the surface, making acts of interpretation seem superfluous. Therefore, rather than trying to interpret the play, it is more useful to ask, following the suggestion of Gilles Deleuze, what it does. The play is a dramamachine that produces loss and asserts the centrality of loss to the constitution of selfhood. This loss is achieved by the deployment of perversion, both sexual and linguistic, against Boy and Girl's innocence. The use of perversion ultimately even questions whether there was ever any state of presence that preceded loss. These tactics seem to suggest a wider set of sexual possibilities, but the tactics are ultimately subordinated to the production of melancholia though loss, a subordination that traps the work in a world of severely limited possibilities and encounters.<br>

Abstract: The memory of the "Solidarity" movement, problems of memory and conflicts of memory are analyzed in the contemporary context of the formation of collective identities in Poland. Politics of memory and commemoration are discussed as part of the politics of symbolization. Symbolic construction of "Solidarity" is analyzed on two levels: the symbolism of the organization of collective actions and discursive symbolism—in other words—symbolism in the "Solidarity" movement and the symbolization of the movement. The other aspect implies politics of symbolization, politics of memory and commemoration, conflict of interpretations and conflict about the memory. The "Solidarity" movement has had many meanings and the interpretation of the movement can refer to various frames of meanings: a workers' revolution, a civil revolution, a movement for national liberation, a movement for religious deprivatization, a moral movement. The multiplicity of meanings has generated conflicts of interpretations. Collective memory is crucial for the phenomenon of "Solidarity" both as a historical movement and as representations in discourses—the symbolic movement of memory.<br>

Article Title: Smashing the Mirror of Yamato: Sakaguchi Ango, Decadence and a (Post-metaphysical) Buddhist Critique of Culture<br>
Publisher: International Research Center for Japanese Studies<br>
Issue: i40058970<br>
Date: 1 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Shields James Mark<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on several key philosophical themes in the criticism of Sakaguchi Ango (1906—1955), one of postwar Japan's most influential and controversial writers. Associated with the underground kasutori culture as well as the Burai-ha of Tamura Taijirō (1911-1983), Oda Sakunosuke (1913-1947) and Dazai Osamu (1909-1948), Ango gained fame for two provocative essays on the theme of daraku or "decadence"—"Darakuron" and "Zoku darakuron"—published in 1946, in the wake of Japan's traumatic defeat and the beginnings of the Allied Occupation. Less well known is the fact that Ango spent his student years studying classical Buddhist texts in Sanskrit, Pali and Tibetan, and that at one time he aspired to the priesthood. This article analyses the concept of daraku in the two essays noted above, particularly as it relates to Ango's vision of a refashioned morality based on an interpretation of human subjectivity vis-à-vis the themes of illusion and disillusion. It argues that, despite the radical and modernist flavor of Ango's essays, his "decadence" is best understood in terms of Mahāyāna and Zen Buddhist concepts. Moreover, when the two essays on decadence are read in tandem with Ango's wartime essay on Japanese culture ("Nihon bunka shikan," 1942), they form the foundation for a "post-metaphysical Buddhist critique of culture," one that is pragmatic, humanistic, and non-reductively physicalist.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we begin by suggesting an intuitive model of time embodying a notion of temporal distance that we claim is at work in Gadamer's hermeneutics, while it is rejected in Collingwood's theory of interpretation. To show this, after a brief review of the influence of Collingwood on Gadamer and of their disagreement over the possibility of recovering an author's intention, we examine in turn their answers to the problem of transposition, upon which the philosophy of Dilthey supposedly foundered. We show that Gadamer embraced the idea of temporal distance in his solution, which consisted in claiming that the distance between an author from the past and us is filled in by tradition, which opens access to the text for us, while Collingwood considered explanations of the actions of historical agents, and by extension understanding of a text, in intentional or rational terms. Furthermore, he thought that such explanations are not causal, and that the thoughts involved in them do not stand within the flow of physical time, which is involved in any notion of temporal distance. This is why Collingwood felt entitled to anti-relativistic conclusions about the recovery of authorial intentions, conclusions that prompted Gadamer to claim that "the dimension of hermeneutical mediation which is passed through in every act of understanding" escaped him. We then discuss the underlying notions of time at work in both Gadamer and Collingwood, showing that Ricoeur had a better appreciation of the issue, since he saw that Collingwood's moves parallel, up to a point, Heidegger's critique of "vulgar time," albeit with an entirely different result. We also point to the importance in Collingwood's thinking of his notion of "incapsulation."<br>

Publisher: Department for Music and Musicology of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Croatian Musicological Society, Music Academy of the University of Zagreb<br>
Issue: i40074891<br>

Author(s): Viljoen Martina<br>
Abstract: This article focuses on the philosopher Christopher Norris's critique of the way in which the New Musicology deploys Jacques Derrida's much-celebrated (and equally much-abused) notion of deconstruction, as well as Paul de Man's lesser-known writings (in the musicological field) on aesthetic ideology. The implications of Norris's critique for a case study from the South African art music repertoire, Arnold van Wyk's Missa in illo tempore, are examined, demonstrating how three diverging readings of the work, resulting in three different hermeneutic outcomes, promulgate notions of a hypernormative contextualism which might frame, and even override musical interpretation. Prošlo je više od trideset godina od kada je Joseph Kerman (1980.) prvi osporio glazbenu analizu kao disciplinary postupak u svojem članku »Kako da uđemo u analizu i kako da iz nje izađemo« (»How we got into analysis and how to get out«). Njegovo kanonsko djelo Contemplating Music (1985.), objavijeno pet godina kasnije, upućuje na to da Kerman ne zagovara istraživački postupak niti samo kao kompilaciju relevantnih povijesnih činjenica niti kao opis i dokumentiranje formalnih unutarnjih odnosa u nekom glazbenom djelu. On se prije zalaže za analitički pristup koji će se baviti ne samo formalnim sadržajem nekog djela ili njegovim neposrednim ili prethodnim povijesno-referentnim okvirom, nego i aspektima afekta i ekspresije, znacenja glazbe i kulturnog konteksta unutar kojega je proizvedeno i prihvaceno. Takozvana Nova muzikologija pojavila se unutar takve antiformalističke klime. Izvan je opsega ovoga članka raspravljati raznim pristupima koji su se tijekom posljedja tri desetljeća pojavili pod zastavom Nove muzikologije. Stoga će se fokusirati na pojam interdisciplinarnosti kako ga se upotrebaljava u Novoj muzikologiji. I još uže, rasprava se koncentrira na filozofa Christopher Norhsa i njegovu kritiku načina na koji Nova muzikologija razvija proslavljeni (i jednako tako mnogo zloupotrebljavani) pojam de~<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i40079950<br>

Author(s): Murthy Viren<br>
Abstract: Although ZhangTaiyan is famous for being a late Qing nationalist and revolutionary, scholars have yet to explore fully the significance of his Buddhist writings, especially as they relate to time and history. This article closely examines Zhang's writings about time and history and points out that Zhang made two interrelated but potentially conflicting arguments. On the one hand, he invoked Yogācāra Buddhism and Zhuang Zi to expound a relativistic vision of time and history. From this perspective, each nation has its historical particularity and cannot be judged from an external standard. However, on the other hand, in a context where intellectuals were uncritically adopting a framework of history as progress, Zhang grounded the theory of evolution in a theory of karmic seeds to develop an interpretation of history as a double movement in which the good gets better and the bad gets worse. The article delves into the significance of Zhang's arguments by highlighting the symmetries between Zhang's exposition of history and the logic of capitalism. Such structural similarities suggest that Zhang could think about time and history in this way precisely because he inhabited a world mediated by the dynamic of capitalism. His writings on Zhuang Zi and Buddhism should be seen as an example of a resistance to capitalism that is not based on a narrative of progress. In the context of twentieth-century Chinese intellectual history, where narratives of progress and evolution are a dominant chord, Zhang's counterpunctual critique of evolution is especially inspiring.<br>

An interview with Ariette Farge, whose extensive experience of work with archives was paralleled by an intense effort to understand and think about them, offers us her insights into the resemblances between writing history and writing under constraint, as well as on different ways of using and transmitting documents when writing history (presentation, quotation, interpretation).<br>

Author(s): Arcaya Jose M.<br>
Abstract: The principle of hermeneutical interpretation (i.e., the art and discipline of analyzing the symbols of sacred texts) is explained and applied to the analytical group situation. It is maintained that the approach employed by this methodology provides a viable manner for understanding patients' unconscious communications. In particular, the relationship between metaphorical communication and the here-and-now therapeutic experience is discussed. It is argued that the unconscious manifests itself as a set o f metaphorical expressions. The paper presents two clinical vignettes illustrating how this hermeneutical methodology can aid the therapist to "read" the unconscious meanings of such metaphors.<br>

Abstract: This paper raises the question whether language and violence are internally connected. It starts from the experience of violence and from its theoretical interpretation as violence in the context of political forms of life which are challenged by complaints about violence. Such forms of life have to confront this issue because they are supposed to be responsive to claims and demands of others who articulate violence as an experience of violation. Whether a kind of responsive ethos may be based on the suspected inner connection between language and violence is being discussed at the end.<br>

Abstract: La problématique de la reconnaissance que Ricoeur développe dans son ultime ouvrage n'est pas seulement un nouveau chantier philosophique qu'il ouvre à ses lecteurs. Une lecture rétrospective de son oeuvre découvre que cette thématique est le dernier fruit de l'herméneutique des symboles développée dans les années 60 et de l'herméneutique du soi exposée dans Soi-même comme un autre. Une interprétation systématique des trois études du Parcours de la reconnaissance montre quel sens la formule : « Je me suis reconnu philosophe » revêtirait dans la bouche de Ricœur. The topic of recognition that Ricoeur develops in his final work does not only open a whole new field of inquiry for his readers. A retrospective reading of his work discovers that this theme is the last fruit of the hermeneutics of symbols developped during the 1960s and of the hermeneutics of the self examined in Oneself as Another. A systemic interpretation of the three studies included in Parcours de la reconnaissance shows the meaning that the phrase « I recognized myself as a philosopher » would take on according to Ricœur.<br>

Author(s): MONNIER Raymonde<br>
Abstract: En croisant les approches contemporaines sur la traduction, l'histoire culturelle et l'histoire des idées, l'article cherche à comprendre la signification politique et les enjeux rhétoriques de la traduction des textes républicains de la première Révolution anglaise autour de 1789. Le but est de dépasser l'analyse en termes d'influence d'une tradition, pour s'intéresser à la transmission et au contexte de réception des textes, c'est-à-dire à l'agenda politique et au projet traductif des auteurs dans un état donné de la langue. Comment ces textes s'insèrent-ils dans le contexte intellectuel et les conventions argumentatives du moment révolutionnaire? Dans quelle mesure ces traductions ont-elles été des outils de l'innovation politique? L'interprétation du traducteur éclaire le contexte qui les a inspirées et le processus de transfert et de réception des idées et du vocabulaire. Sur l'horizon d'attente de 1789, le bonheur de la traduction dépend moins de la fidélité à l'original que de la manière de rendre l'esprit du texte et sa force illocutoire pour traduire les idées en actes. By combining contemporary approaches to translation, cultural history and the history of ideas, this article seeks to understand the political meanings and the rhetorical issues involved in the translation of republican texts of the first English Revolution in the French Revolution of 1789. The aim is to go beyond an analysis of the influence of a tradition to concentrate on the transmission and reception of the texts - that is, on the political agenda and their translation. How were these texts incorporated in the intellectual context and in the argumentative conventions of the revolutionary moment? To what degree were these translations the tools of political innovation? The particular interpretation of a translator does much to clarify the context that inspired his translations and illuminates the process of the transfer and reception of ideas and vocabulary. In the political climate of 1~<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Abstract: El artículo propone una lectura de la novela de Antonio Gil, Cosa mentale (1994), como construcción artificiosa del pasado a través de la puesta en juego de los procedimientos pictóricos aplicados a la poesía. El dictum horaciano ut pictura poiesis será revisado a partir del registro delirante y experimental de una novela que indaga en las maneras de configurar el pasado histórico recurriendo a temporalidades alternativas al tiempo de la modernidad histórica. De esta manera, según un criterio analógico, es posible identificar retóricas de la imagen y de la representación a nivel narrativo, en correspondencia con la narratividad pictórica. Finalmente, se entrega una interpretación sobre la perspectiva transhistórica del narrador que permitiría entender las anacronías narrativas como rupturas entre tiempo de la modernidad y tiempo del mito. This article proposes a reading of the Antonio Gil's novel, Cosamentale (1994), as an artificial construction of the past through the pictorial procedures applied to poetry. Horatio's dictum ut pictura poiesis will be revised on the basis of this delirious and experimental novel that explores a ways to configure the historic past resorting to alternatives temporalities in respect of historical modernity time. In this way, according to an analogical criterion, we identified rhetorics of the image and the representation in the narrative level, in correspondence with the pictorial narrative. Finally, we give an interpretation about the transhistoric perspective of the narrator that explains narrative anachronisms between the time of modernity and the time of the myth.<br>

Abstract: O artigo aborda o pensamento de Emmanuel Lévinas a partir de duas perspectivas distintas mas complementares: numa primeira fase, recorrendo ao romance de guerra de Erich M. Remarque intitulado A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), procuraremos, com a ajuda de Jacques Derrida e de René Girard, desconstruir o pensamento de Lévinas, sustentando a ideia de que o "Humanismo do Outro Homem" contém vestígios de violência dissimulados percebíveis, quer a partir da interpretação levinasiana do referido romance, quer no modo como Lévinas resolve o problema da legítima defesa; numa segunda fase, demonstraremos que a restauração do pensamento de Lévinas passa, por um lado, pela noção de "filialidade" (e não a de "Rosto" ou a de "substituição"), a pedra basilar não corrosiva do pensamento de Lévinas e, por outro lado, pela ideia de que a "desfiguração" da fenomenologia e da ontologia, operada pelo autor, é aparente uma vez que estas não obstruam a alteridade mas antes a tornam possível. The article deals with the thought of Emmanuel Levinas using two distinct but complementary perspectives: in a first phase, using the war novel by Erich M. Remarque entitled A l'Ouest Rien de Nouveau (Im Westen Nichts Neues), we will try, with the help of Jacques Derrida and René Girard, deconstruct the thought of Levinas, supporting the idea that the "Humanism of the Other Man" contains traces of perceivable covert violence, either from the Levinasian interpretation of the Novel, or in the way that Levinas solves the problem of self-defense; in a second phase, we will demonstrate that restoration of Levinas's thought is, on one hand, the notion of "filiality" (and not 'Face' or 'exchange'), the cornerstone non--corrosive of Levinas's thought, on the other hand, by using the idea of 'defacement' of phenomenology and ontology, used by the author, is apparent since they do not obstruct the alterity but rather becomes it possible.<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: The essay focuses on the term textuality and foliows and comments the changes of its use and meaning. It examines the link between Russian Formalist concept of literariness (mostly Jakobson and Tynianov), its Bakhtinian switch to intertextuality, developed in quite contrastive but distinet ways by Julia Kristeva and Gerard Genette, and finally it interprets the use of the term textuality in Derridian deconstruction and Foucault’s semiotics of the world. The point of the essay is to show the importance of the deconstructive challenge of the traditionally supposed opposition between speech and writing as well as between the world and the seif. Following Hugh Silverman’s concept of the autobiographical textuality, the essay makes attemps to suggest an interpretation of ali Kundera’s writings (both „fiction“ and „essays“) as one undistinguishable textuality without óbvious boundaries of a genre or identity of the person who speaks.<br>

Abstract: Patočka summarized his conception of style in the essay „Umění a čas" [Art and Time] (1966), in which he observes style over historie periods and its increasing departure from a priori, metaphysically ascertained and universally valid meaning. In modern art, style is established by the freedom of the Creative act; its centre of gravity shifts to the level of „signifier". Patočka's essay „O minulém rázu umìění" [Concerning the Former Nature of Art] (written 1965) helped to clarify „aesthetic attitude". In this essay, he develops an interpretational duet: a critique of Hegel's metaphysical starting point, which distances itself from the experience of modern art, and an appraisal of Hegel's interpretation of time, which remains inspirational. In accordance with it, Patočka the phenomenologist considers art the place of „destructive creation", of vivifying revelation, whose source is in man. The next part of the article calls attention to a lecture by Paul Ricoeur „Vyprávění, metafora a teorie interpretace" [Narrative, Metaphor and the Theory of Interpretation] (1987), in which Ricoeur introduced a modern hermeneutic approach to literary studies. What is most relevant here is the concept of the „double reference". The first aspect of reference relates to empirical reality; the second to the „productive reference", which designs a world created by the literary work. Semantic innovation in the narration of a story has a parallel in the semantic innovation of the metaphor. In both cases there emerges „the new, the as yet unsaid, the inexpressible - in language".<br>

Abstract: The study deals with the problem of Stephen Greenblatt's approaches to an analysis of literary work. The author analyzes Greenblatt's concepts of interpretation of literary work and notices the dangerous results of such interpretations in which literary work as a specifical esthetical object is dissolved in the wide frame of cultural history. On the other hand, he tries to represent how Greenblatt's looking for historical context via permanent negotiation with the texts and reading of textual traces can enriches the work of literary historian.<br>

Abstract: The article is concerned with the foundation of figurative sense (FS) by metaphorization, as well as on the operation of FS. The author emphasizes the directive function of domains, which substitutes metaphorical seeing for „seeing" and determines an aspect proper to FS. The essential component of FS is not grasping, but is the aesthetic experience of the distance between ordinary vision and the new vision. Distance is surmounted by a stream of images that implement FS. By displaying this stream, FS merges with daydreaming, but much more with the play of accidental connections. In addition to metaphorization, FS is sometimes based on placing statements out of logical space. The author argues against a unilateral interpretation of correlations between the metaphorical statement and its context. He provides examples to demonstrate the diversification of this correlation and its impact on the foundation of FS.<br>

Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: Sartre's theory of the imagination is important both as an alternative to the idea that the imagination consists of images contained somehow in the mind - the "illusion of immanence" — and as an early formulation of Sartre's conception of consciousness. In this paper I defend Sartre's theory of imaginative consciousness against some of its critics. I show how difficulties with his theory parallel a perennial problem in Sartre-interpretation, that of understanding how consciousness can negate its past and posit possibilities beyond the facticity of its situation. In this short essay I will not provide a detailed exposition of Sartre's theory of the imagination. Rather, I provide the basis of an interpretation of this theory that emphasizes the role that the past plays in imaginative consciousness.<br>

Abstract: The article advances an interpretation of the self as an imaginary object. Focusing on the relationship between selfhood and memory in Sartre's The Transcendence of the Ego, I argue that Sartre offers useful resources for thinking about the self in terms of narratives. Against interpretations that hold that the ego misrepresents consciousness or distorts it, I argue that the constitution of the ego marks a radical transformation of the conscious field. To prove this point, I turn to the role of reflection and memory in the creation of the self. Reflection and memory weave past, present and future into a consistent and meaningful life story. This story is no other than the self. I propose to understand the self as a fictional or imaginary entity, albeit one that has real presence in human life.<br>

Abstract: In view of the pluralism of current exegetical methodologies, constant recourse is had to models for interpretation of texts, be these more ancient stages of the text, as in historical-critical exegesis, or schemes of a logical character as in structural exegesis. What advantages does the use of a model offer to interpretation? With the analysis limited to a narrative text, an examination of the contribution from the philosophy of history (H.-I. Marrou), from epistemology (K. R. Popper), and from philosophical hermeneutics (H.-G. Gadamer,), helps to see in the logical dimension of the different models, the source of their interpretative power. At the hermeneutical level this opens up a perspective of unity in the exegetical methodologies.<br>

Abstract: The study of biography as an exercise in sociology has been under-used. The early proponents of a sociology of biography -most notably Wilhelm Dilthey -have not had their work greatly developed. However, with the emergence of Paul Ricoeur's work on the nature of narrativity, time and interpretation, plus the developing influence of the work of others, a hermeneutics of biography has now begun. This paper explores this development, and, further, briefly examines two highly important biographies to explore how theoretical injunction is matched by empirical practice.<br>

Article Title: NARRATING CRISIS: THE DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION OF THE 'WINTER OF DISCONTENT'<br>
Publisher: British Sociological Association Publications Limited<br>
Issue: i40108657<br>
Date: 5 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Hay Colin<br>
Abstract: The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible. In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born of the winter of discontent.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge University Press<br>

Date: 8 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Ezzy Douglas<br>
Abstract: Two central unresolved problems in labour process theory are the disjuncture between structure and agency and the problem of what constitutes 'good' work. This paper argues that a hermeneutic conception of the self as constructed through narrative provides a resolution to these two issues. Hermeneutics conceptualises the self as neither a solitary entity impervious to the influence of others, nor as a mere reflection of objective structures or 'discourses of power'. Rather, in the process of self-interpretation a person uses socially learnt cultural discourses to construct and reconstruct a coherent sense of narrative-identity. Substantive illustrations are drawn from labour process theory, recent developments in management theory, and some more general studies of the meaning of working.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113403<br>
Date: 4 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Ronen Ruth<br>
Abstract: Temporal concepts such as "order," "chronology," "narrative present," and "exposition" are extensively used in narrative theory. Accepted notions of time can contribute to our understanding of these concepts and can allow us to question their "temporal" meaning in the context of fictional narrative. Fictional time may be thought of as a system of relations unique to the fictional world after real time. Theories of narrative tend to adopt an essentialist interpretation of temporal concepts and to ignore the ontological divergence between time in fiction and time in reality. As a result, concepts such as "exposition" or "present" appear which appear to carry a direct "temporal" meaning, actually function in a way that indicates the nature of time in fiction. In fiction, temporal divisions and time segmentations do not just construct a temporal structure; they also mark degrees of factuality in the fictional world.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117536<br>

Author(s): VUILLEMIN Jules<br>
Abstract: Épictète, rapportant l'argument dominateur, dit que Cléanthe en a contesté la seconde prémisse, à savoir que le passé est nécessaire. On expose pour les rejeter deux conjectures qui donnent une interprétation « logique » de cette solution. La première voit en Cléanthe l'ancêtre d'Ockham : il aurait contesté la nécessité non du passé, mais des propositions ayant la forme du passé sans porter sur le passé. Solution insuffisante si le dominateur n'est pas ambigu. Pour la rendre acceptable, il faudrait avec Jean Duns Scot, contester le principe de nécessité conditionnelle. Mais on quitte alors Cléanthe. La seconde conjecture, due à Leibniz, ne prête au passé qu'une nécessité conditionnelle de même type que celle du présent et du futur. Mais comment décrire alors la modalité propre au passé ? La conjecture qu'on proposera est d'ordre « physique ». Elle tire, pour la modalité du passé, les conséquences de l'éternel retour et du caractère cyclique du temps. Cleanthes solved the Master Argument by denying that the past if true is necessary. According to a first interpretation sentences, though in past tense, may be about future events. This solution, in the style of Ockham, supposes the Master Argument to be ambiguous. It is shown, however, that once the ambiguity is dispelled, the argument loses its validity only if the principle of conditional necessity is questioned, as it has been by Duns Scot ; but this has nothing to do with the « necessity » of the past. A second interpretation, given by Leibniz, identifies the necessity of the past with conditional necessity, but ignores the specific role of past in the argument. A third interpretation will be proposed which falls within the province of physics rather than of logic : past has no distinguished status because time is cyclic.<br>

Publisher: Beauchesne<br>
Issue: i40117551<br>
Date: 6 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): RAULET Gérard<br>
Abstract: L'interprétation des derniers écrits de Horkheimer a suscité des controverses parfois violentes ; ils semblent en effet traduire la résignation, voire le désespoir, et marquer un retour à la théologie. Leur signification peut cependant être reconsidérée si l'on conçoit l'évolution de Horkheimer à la lumière du statut de la vérité dans la Théorie critique. La résignation, le pessimisme et la théologie provoquent-ils un changement de statut de la vérité qui autoriserait à distinguer deux Théories critiques ou ne peut-on voir dans la permanence de thèmes comme celui d'une vérité utopique et non représentable, de la nostalgie, de la dette envers l'humanité et dans l'usage du pessimisme les signes d'une continuité ? Il se pourrait alors que l'économie interne de la Théorie critique ait changé, mais sans rupture, et que ces thèmes aient constitué dès le départ un ressort essentiel du caractère critique de la Théorie critique. The interpretation of the last essays of Horkheimer has raised controversies and even polemics in so far as hopelesness, resignation and the turn back to religion seem to predominate in them. In order to reconsider this problem, Horkheimer's evolution will be interpreted here in the light of the definition of truth in Critical Theory. Do resignation, pessimism and theology involve a new definition of truth — so that one could speak of a second Critical Theory, or can themes like the utopical, nonrepresentable nature of truth, the nostalgy, the debt to humanity and the use of pessimism be understood as signs of a continuity in which the economy of Critical Theory may have changed but without any rupture between its early phase and the late works of Horkheimer and Adorno ? If this is the case one has then to show how Critical Theory could preserve its critical properties in a changed political and social situation.<br>

Abstract: Depuis le célèbre article de Merleau-Ponty, « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », la manière dont on évalue le rapport entre ces deux auteurs détermine ou exprime autant d'interprétations historiques du structuralisme et de choix théoriques ou philosophiques quant aux sciences sociales. Cette filiation se voulait une critique: être fidèle à la découverte de Mauss, celle du caractère central de la réciprocité dans la vie sociale, imposait de dépasser la sociologie vers une sémiologie générale. Cet article s'efforce de montrer qu'il ne s'agit pas là, contrairement à l'interprétation subtile qu'en fit Merleau-Ponty, défaire de la réalité sociale un système de points de vue substituables ou de mouvements córreles de subjectivation, mais de montrer que ce sont les « valeurs » qui, du fait de leur nature, de leur ontologie, doivent nécessairement circuler entre plusieurs points de vue exclusifs et complémentaires. Il revisite la célèbre critique de Lévi-Strauss à Mauss sur l'explication de l'obligation de donner par une « force des choses », et replace l'apport de l'anthropologie structurale dans la philosophie de l'esprit contemporaine, là où elle se confronte aux questions ouvertes par la physique sur l'ontologie des objets quantiques. Since Merleau-Ponty's famous paper « De Mauss à Claude Lévi-Strauss », the way the link between these two authors has been construed determine or reveal as many historical interpretations of structuralism as philosophical and theoretical choices about social sciences. We know that this vindicated kinship was supposed to be critical: being faithful to Mauss's discovery, that of the centrality of reciprocity in social life, compelled us to overcome sociology in the direction of a general semiology. This paper, in opposition at Merleau-Ponty's subtle interpretation of this move, tries to show that it was not aimed at a redefinition of social reality as a system of substitutablepoints of view and correlated movements of subjectivation, but at t~<br>

Abstract: On associe généralement la figure de Satan à une signification indigente ou mesquine. Dans la Philosophie de la révélation, Schelling tente au contraire d'en donner une interprétation différente, selon laquelle la « mauvaiseté positive » de Satan n'est pas seulement assumée, mais également revalorisée. Cependant, le rôle de Satan demeure ambigu, incarnant à la fois le tentateur universel et le maillon nécessaire à la révélation de Dieu lui-même. Dans cette étude, il s'agit donc de montrer à la fois la nature amphibolique du Diable, et de rendre compte des multiples endossements qu'il recouvre. Une tâche qui implique précisément la mise en évidence du rôle incontournable de Satan dans la victoire finale du bien, et qui se manifeste, en termes schellingiens, par l'incompatibilité de l'homme avec le feu dévorant du principe de lumière, laquelle nécessite un principe obscur qui hâte la séparation, pressent le mal et le provoque. One usually associates the figure of Satan with an impoverished, insufficient signification. On the contrary, in the Philosophy of Revelation Schelling tries to give a different interpretation, according to which Satan's potential for evil is not only accepted but embraced and given a positive valence, postulating a sort of "positivity of evil". However, Satan's role remains ambiguous, since he represents both the universal tempter and a necessary link in the process that reveals God's presence in the world. In this paper, I want to emphasize the Devil's twofold nature and to explore his multiple forms. This highlights Satan's necessary role in the final triumph of good, and how this role appears, in Schellingian terms, through the human inability to sound the depths of the consuming fire of divine light, which necessitates the existence of a dark principle that entails a separation, foreknows evil and thereby creates it.<br>

Author(s): GONTIER THIERRY<br>
Abstract: À l'encontre d'une école récente d'interprétation qui tend à voir dans les Essais de Montaigne une pensée du renoncement à toute maîtrise de l'action, nous voulons montrer qu'il y a chez lui une authentique pensée de la prudence. Si les références aristotéliciennes et stoïciennes sont sollicitées par Montaigne, il reste que le caractère mouvant et imprévisible de la fortune ainsi que la part de fortuit inscrite dans l'être l'obligent à redéfinir les contours de la notion traditionnelle de prudence. À un premier niveau de prudence qui consiste à savoir agir dans le monde s'ajoute un second niveau, qui consiste à savoir se préserver face aux sollicitations du monde. Montaigne inaugure ainsi une pensée moderne de la prudence, qui trouvera, mutatis mutandis, une expression contemporaine chez Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer et Paul Ricœur. Contrary to a recent school of interpretation which aims to see in Montaigne's Essays a thought of renouncement to any control of action, we intend to show the presence of an authentic thought of prudence. If Montaigne refers to aristotelician and stoician texts, the unsettledness and unpredictableness of fortune, as well as the part of fortuitness which is part of the being, require him nevertheless to redefine the outlines of the traditionnal notion of prudence. To a first level of prudence, which consists in knowing how to act in the word, one must add a second level, which consists in knowing how to preserve oneself facing with word's appeals. Montaigne thus inaugurates a modern thought of prudence, which will find, mutatis mutandis, a contemporary expression in Hannah Arendt, Georg Gadamer and Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: L'article s'interroge sur la place réservée à l'individualité, dont le motif est si fortement marqué dans les premiers travaux de Schleiermacher, dans le système abouti et notamment dans l'Éthique. En premier lieu, c'est le rôle de la lecture de Spinoza qui est mis en avant, comme l'inspiration philosophique fondamentale du projet de Schleiermacher, y compris dans son Éthique. Mais l'adoption d'un cadre systématique après 1803, notamment avec la Dialectique après 1811, risque de minorer la place dévolue à l'individualité. C'est dans la conception originale de la temporalité que se trouve la clé de l'articulation entre la logique systématique de la différenciation fonctionnelle et la logique éthique de l'individualisation. This article inquires the significance of the concept of individuality, the purpose of which is particularly stressed in the first writings of Schleiermacher, in the accomplished system and especially in Ethics. At first, it is the interpretation of Spinoza's writings which is put forward as the fundamental philosophical inspiration in Schleiermacher's project, including in Ethics. But the adoption of a systematic framework after 1803, especially in Dialectics after 1811, risks undermining the importance dedicated to individuality. It is in the original conception of time that lays the key connection between the systematic logic of functional differentiation and the ethical logic of individualisation.<br>

Abstract: The problem being dealt with in this paper is whether a text has only one legitimate meaning, or no meaning at all. The question becomes even more acute when the contexts of sender and receiver are different. Polysemy and ambiguity are well-known obstacles to communication on the level of the word. The necessity of a general semiotic theory is stressed, and explains the difference between denotation and connotation. The functionality of metaphor in biblical language points to the interpretive value of polyvalency. The impression of unlimited indeterminacy created by the recent emphasis on the active role of the reader, is in a sense misleading since author and reader function as a textual strategy. On the other hand, the actualization of the textual expression as the content of the text by applying the various codes and subcodes, implies a continuous interaction between intensional and extensional approaches. In this respect topics, thematics, ideological and world structures are operative. Since interpretation and application are not to be separated in a pragmatic context, as is the case with the text of the Bible, there inevitably remains the possibility of multiple interpretations due to the interpreting and applying of the text of the Bible in a concrete situation. Yet this interpretation and appropriation should always be done as comprehension of the text and in continuity with the tradition.<br>

Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that historical interpretation of the New Testament is necessary to provide information for setting the parameters of valid readings of the New Testament. Such an interpretation serves the purpose of alienation between reader and text and enables the interpreter to ask critical questions about the communicability and relevance of these texts. The nature of the New Testament necessitates historical interpretation. Current historico-critical interpretation of the New Testament is discussed and evaluated with a view to possibilities and limitations in the light of current developments in literary science, history of philosophy and historiography.<br>

Abstract: In a first part, the article tells the story of the Hermeneutics Group of the NTSSA. It is a story with three phases. In the first phase, interpretation was seen as more than the application of methods. In the second phase, the active role of the reader became more important. In the third phase, the importance of interpretive communities became more apparent. In a second part, some of the issues resulting from these developments are discussed under the rubric 'Why do we interpret the New Testament?'

Abstract: This article proposes some guidelines for relevant Indian interpretations of the Bible. It examines the traditional Western methods and perspectives as well as the challenges to these methods in Biblical hermeneutics in India. Shifting trends in Western methods of biblical interpretation and their inability to meet the needs of the context could give the motivation to develop methods and principles for authentic Indian biblical interpretations. Drawing on insights from the biblical interpretation in Latin America, Asia and South Africa, Indian Biblical hermeneutics must move towards discovering critical tools that are helpful in the Indian context. Such an endeavour needs to take seriously both the inner and the outer reality of India and develop a proper perspective for Indian Biblical interpretations. Judicious use of the critical tools and resources available in the context, commitment to the poor and the oppressed and faith-response to God are imperative for evolving effective Indian biblical interpretations. The complex Indian context demands a plurality of critical biblical readings with the people in pluri-religious community, open to the dynamic activity of the Spirit with a goal to transform our society and promote communal harmony.<br>

Abstract: This article interprets Mark 14:22-25, using one of the new approaches in biblical interpretation, namely, pragmatic analysis. In pragmatic analysis, a text is considered a linguistic unit composed of linguistic elements (signs) with the scope of communicating a message. Interpretation involves examining the linguistic elements, the relationship between them (the syntax), their semantic valence in view of their communicative potentiality. Reading Mark 14:22-25 with this approach leads us to the conclusion that the evangelist included the institution account in his Gospel primarily to explain the significance and effect of Jesus' death to the reader. By adequately preparing the reader on the power of the word of Jesus before coming to read the institution account, Mark achieves a rhetorical effect: the conviction of the power of the words of Jesus and an admiration for the generosity of Jesus. This elicits in the reader an attraction to enter into Jesus' covenant.<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical theory remains rooted in a metaphysics of the "interiority of meaning". For example, Ricoeur transposed Freud's metaphysics of interior libidinal meaning into a literary theory of interpretation. The corollary to Freud's metaphysics of interiorized meaning is "desire as lack". Deleuze and Guattari's attack on Freud's theory of historical-libidinal drives formed the basis of their explication of the "rhizomatic" exteriority of meaning, which they develop, in literary terms, in their book, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In their view, Kafka's novels model a style of writing that disavows interior meaning. They also oppose the primacy of Freud's concept of desire-as-lack with that of desire-as-plenitude. This paper will discuss a mode of biblical interpretation based on the twin concepts of exteriority of meaning and desire-as-plentitude, according to four interpretive stategies: 1) rediscover one's hyperdifferentiated life; 2) think politically; 3) seek out interstitial spaces; 4) change one's point of entry.<br>

Abstract: In spite of the Reformed tradition's profound respect for the bible as the living Word of God, it has often tolerated an uncritical stance on cultural-historical biases both within the bible and during its history of interpretation. Consequently, dynamic processes of interpretation and reinterpretation within these documents have often been neglected as important hermeneutic keys for later audiences. Amidst many opportunities posed by postmodern thinking, and by voices from feminist, womanist and other contextual theologies, the Reformed tradition remains particularly challenged to account for its identity and ethos in terms of its primary theological orientation and God images. The essay aims at providing a possible theological-rhetorical path towards reopening the transformative potential of two texts that are life-inhibiting for many people today, namely 1 Cor 14:33-40 and Eph 5:21-6:9. Both are surrounded by references to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, with the implied rhetorical effect that the church may be edified and unified in love. However, through the history of interpretation of these texts, the functioning of the body of Christ was often inhibited while church leadership was distorted. The essay therefore centers biblical "authority" - as ultimate test for the relevance and lifegiving potential of the Reformed tradition - within the multidimensional (albeit patriarchal) nature of these texts, particularly within their soteriological perspectives on God and humanity. The theological framework of these texts is thus emphasised as a visionary strategy towards the liberation and healing of creation.<br>

Abstract: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have proposed that the structure of western knowledge can be reconceived according to a 'rhizomatic' model, which focuses on the unlimited relations that interconnect all things in the cosmos and on the spaces of dynamic interaction between then. Applied to the field of biblical interpretation, rhizomatic hermeneutics promises to avert the nihilism latent within biblical historical positivism, provide a theoretical framework for exploring the relations between the interpreter and the text, and reintroduce ethics to the practice of biblical interpretation. A 'rhizomatic' model of hermeneutics has the advantage of recognizing the broader ecology within which biblical hermeneutics actually functions, including the subjectivity of the interpreter, and the role of interpreting communities.<br>

Abstract: After a brief survey of recent research on the Scriptures in the Book of Revelation in general, this study turns to Revelation 21:1-22: 9 before addressing some disputed issues in Revelation's use of the Scriptures. Is John interpreting Scripture or does he use Scripture merely as a quarry for his own statements? While the modern understanding of interpretation finds it difficult to find common elements with ancient approaches to interpretation, post-modernity offers a better chance to appreciate John's way of dealing with the Scriptures. John's approach must be understood by situating it among the various Jewish approaches to the Scriptures. It can best be characterised as that of 'rewritten scripture' and is close to midrash and targum.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: i396847<br>
Date: 10 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): MellonAbstract: This article considers some methodological issues that arise when empirical inquiry is conducted within the framework of qualitative assumptions about the nature of reality and how we as humans can know it. These assumptions posit an empirical reality that is complex, intertwined, best understood as a contextual whole, and inseparable from the individuals-including the researchers--who know that reality. Four primary issues are considered in this article: the researcher as interpreter; the emergent nature of qualitative research; understanding the experience of others; and trustworthiness in qualitative research. Further, the article discusses methodological practices that have arisen in the context of qualitative assumptions and issues. The practices described are drawn from diverse qualitative research traditions, including participant observation, naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, hermeneutic approaches to the interpretation of texts (and actions as texts), qualitative evaluation, and a body of methodological literature that calls itself generically "qualitative research." The goals of the article are threefold: (1) to present the internal rationale of qualitative research as issues and practices that arise within the context of assumptions about reality and what we can know about it; (2) to encourage researchers to examine the relevance of qualitative assumptions, issues, and practices to their own research problems; and (3) to point readers toward more detailed discussions of qualitative research.<br>

Issue: i397452<br>
Date: 4 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Shenk Gary<br>
Abstract: Communities, whether they are "real" or virtual, are mediated by interpretation. One's place within a community is also constituted by an ongoing metaphoric "reading" through which one attempts to understand what others within the community say and do. Virtual communities are unique in making such reading explicit through further acts of writing: participants form their communities through public performances of writing, reading, and interpreting of texts. Any analysis of virtual communities must take into account both the exchange of meaning through texts and the fact of a mediating distance between participants. The hermeneutic theories of Paul Ricoeur can support an analysis of these activities, which accounts for temporal and spatial distance in the exchange of the community's texts. Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory can be used to describe the process that drives virtual communities, which makes them into forums that attempt to "connect the scattered members of an invisible republic" [1, p. 43] in an electronic world.<br>

Abstract: L'article identifie une tension dans la représentation hayékienne des règles de droit. Alors qu'elles jouent une fonction essentielle dans la coordination au sein de l'ordre spontané en définissant les attentes légitimes des agents, Hayek ne développe pas réellement les mécanismes par lesquels émerge une interprétation partagée des règles. D'abord, les fonctions des règles de droit au sein de l'ordre spontané sont présentées. Puis nous montrons que les règles sont constituées par les attentes que les agents forment à leur propos. Enfin, nous montrons qu'aucun des deux mécanismes proposés par Hayek -le sens de la justice et le juge -n'est capable de garantir la résolution des conflits d'interprétation entre les individus. De tels conflits mettent en question l'efficacité et la justice de l'ordre spontané. The article focuses on a tension in the Hayekian representation of legal rules. While rules perform an essential function of coordination by providing common interpretation about the legitimate expectations, Hayek does not really develop the mechanisms by which common interpretations may emerge. Firstly, the functions of coordination of rules are presented. We show then that rules are constituted by individual meanings. Finally we show none of the two mechanisms producing shared interpretations, the sense of justice and the judge, is able to guarantee the resolution of conflicts of interpretation between individuals. Such a conflict questions therefore spontaneous order's efficiency and justice.<br>

Abstract: En liant, à partir d'une approche phénoménologique, travail, individu et vie, Michel Henry propose un magistral éclairage de toute l'oeuvre de Marx en tant qu'elle est essentiellement une critique de l'économie et une ontologie sociale. La radicalité d'une telle philosophie économique n'est que très peu soulignée par la pensée marxiste contemporaine, qui n'a sans doute pas donné à l'interprétation Michel Henry l'importance qui est la sienne. Pour autant, sa notion d'individus vivants, ainsi hypostasiés de leurs conditions objectives d'existence, conduit Michel Henry à déformer l'anthropologie de Marx et à en affaiblir la dimension politique. The aim of this article is to show the full critical power of the subjective philosophy of living-labour which Michel Henry develops out of Marx. The radicality of such an economic philosophy was only underlined very little by the contemporary thought Marxist which, one knows it, does not give to the interpretation of Michel Henry the major importance which should be his. For all that, his notion of alive individuals, so taked out from their objective conditions of existence, leads Michel Henry to deform the anthropology of Marx and to weaken the political dimension.<br>

Abstract: This essay is about the crisis of creativity and meaning in contemporary Western culture and how the use of modern landscape and architectural theory works to perpetuate an excessively "hard" or neutral world—a world in which culture can no longer figure or recollect itself. A brief critique of three predominant approaches toward contemporary theory is presented: positivism, the use of paradigms, and the Avant-Garde. In different ways, each approach derives from modern techno-scientific thinking and invariably seeks closure, certainty, and control. The built landscapes that result often suffer from an equally closed explicitude: a stifling immanence where all is exposed and nothing is left to imagination. The essay suggests an alternative strategy grounded in the tradition of hermeneutics. Here, theory is something ever-open, permitting a free association of ideas through the mechanics of situational interpretation and metaphor. Hermeneutics provides the basis for a landscape architectural theory that transcends pictorial image and historical style by critically engaging contemporary circumstance and tradition. The landscape itself is a hermeneutic medium and becomes the ground for such an endeavor, enabling the remembrance, renewal, and transformation of a cultural tradition. The author argues that a hermeneutic approach to the theory and practice of landscape architecture is a way of returning to our designed landscapes the powers of the everyday and the revelatory—the grounds of memory and hope.<br>

Abstract: Die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften ist ein besonderer Fall der Relation der Theologie zur Wissenschaft und ist durch die dynamischen Begriffe der Theologie, der Wissenschaft und der Naturwissenschaften bedingt und kann daher nicht ein fnr allemal bestimmt werden. Ich beschäftige mich hier mit der Situation der Begegnung der Theologie mit den Naturwissenschaften vom Standpunkt ihrer gegenseitigen Wahrheitsansprnche. Das große Fragenkomplex wird in mehreren Schritten analysiert.Nach einfahrenden und geschichtlichen Bemerkungen und Begriffsbestimmungen wird systematisch die Relation der Theologie zu den Naturwissenschaften und die diesbezügliche heutige Situation untersucht, wie auch die offizielle Stellung der Kirche (eine radikale Trennung von Theologie [Religion] und Wissenschaft hat immer Protest der katholischen Kirche hervorgerufen), die Motive fur den Dialog und die Integration und ihre Bedingungen dargestellt. Das Problem des Verhältnisses zwischen der Theologie (Religion) und den Wissenschaften ist typisch fur das Christentum und anderen Religionen eigentlich unbekannt. Die Kirchengeschichte liefert viele Beispiele direkten Konfliktes, in dem beide Seiten viele schwerwiegende Fehler begangen haben. So wie das Christentum auf bestimmten geschichtlichen Ereignissen (der Geburt, dem Tod und der Auferstehung Christi) aufbaut, so ist auch die Theologie an der Wahrheit ihrer Thesen interessiert. Schon im christlichen Altertum sind die klassischen und grundsatzlichen Positionen unter den Theologen entstanden: 1) einer radikalen Opposition und Verwerfung der Wissenschaft, 2) des Dialogs, der Versöhnung und gegenseitigen Ergänzung oder 3) der Gleichgültigkeit.Seitdem nimmt der Konflikt oft eine doppelte Gestalt an: eine institutionelle und eine doktrinäre (oder weltanschauliche). In Hinsicht auf den Charakter der doktrinären Konflikte und der Methode ihrer Losung muß man deutlich zwei Arten unterscheiden: den Konflikt zwischen den Glaubensartikeln (D~<br>

Abstract: Tamburlaine's insistence on making his audience see his sovereign power is a means by which he can organize and control alterity by fixing himself in specular relation to his objects. As the palpable reflections of his identity, Tamburlaine's sights of power produce effects of dramatic literalization by which he can maintain his unified and stable position as sole emperor: the play orders its field of vision by constructing an imaginary subject in fixed relation to its objects. The play, to the extent that it posits stable links between a subject and its images, and between signifiers and signifieds generally, creates a delusional space in which absolute sovereignty becomes possible. The effects of sovereignty, however, continue to define not only the theatrical space of the play, but the space of interpretation as well: critics have tried to account for the contest between aspiration and limitation in Tamburlaine by invoking concepts of theme, genre, character, and author in order to make sense of and therefore stabilize the play's conflicting gestures. Like Tamburlaine, the critic constructs an imaginary space by creating objects in relation to which he can confirm his own unity and power. Tamburlaine thus becomes a figure for the claims of sovereignty that mark all acts of interpretation.<br>

Abstract: According to German criminal law, a person who violates a criminal law rule will be excused under the conditions of § 35 German Criminal Code (necessity as an excuse). What are the reasons for not holding an offender responsible in these cases although he may have even caused the death of his victim? In section II of this essay, the usual answers to this question are analysed. The result is that none of them is utterly convincing. They all have in common that they underestimate the importance of the victim's interest in his personal freedom. In section III, the author puts forward his own interpretation of § 35 German Criminal Code. This interpretation is based on the distinction between two meanings of legal freedom. In the first place the members of a legal community are obliged to respect the „negative freedom“ of each other. On the basis of this understanding of „freedom“ the defence of necessity appears as an alien element within the system of criminal law. However, the status of the members of a legal community is not confined to their „negative freedom.“ To some extent, the criminal law also recognizes their „positive freedom“: the interest of each individual to preserve his personal integrity. The defence of necessity in § 35 German Criminal Code can be interpreted as acknowledging the offender's „positive freedom.“ In the final section of this essay (section IV) this model of explanation is applied to a range of detailed problems raised by § 35 German Criminal Code.<br>

Abstract: C'est d'abord s'étonner de la place qu'occupe dans l'œuvre novatrice de Freud la culture antique. Retracer l'itinéraire de la rencontre avec Œdipe, c'est faire comme un état des lieux. L'Interprétation des Rêves, Totem et Tabou, L'Homme Moïse et la religion monothéiste, mais aussi des articles moins connus, des extraits de sa correspondance, contiennent des analyses inattendues, sur l'origine de la tragédie grecque, son évolution, sa fonction, sur la catharsis, le plaisir tragique, etc... Le but n'est pas d'apprécier la pertinence des réponses, mais de dégager l'originalité d'une démarche qui lie fiction et réalité, structure et histoire, passé et présent. And our first response will be to marvel at the importance of the culture of antiquity in Freud’s innovating work. Tracing up the stages of his encounter with Œdipus is tantamount to an inventory of fixtures. The Interpretation of Dreams, Totem and Taboo, The Man Moses and monotheistic religion, but also less known articles and extracts from his correspondence contain unexpected analyses on the origin of Greek tragedy, its evolution, its function, on catharsis, tragic pleasure, etc. Our aim is not to assess the relevance of the answers but to bring out the originality of a procedure that links up fiction and fact, structure and history, past and present<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i40153127<br>

Author(s): Carlson Thomas A.<br>
Abstract: En explorant plus avant le projet des ouvrages théologiques précédents, Au lieu de soi ne distingue pas simplement la pensée de la création de l'onto-théologie mais la sépare aussi de son dépassement heideggérien, qui demeure pour Marion aussi idolâtrique que la métaphysique elle-même. L'ouvrage se concentre ici autour de l'interprétation de l'adonné comme créature par excellence, ou créature iconique — dont le privilège tient à sa temporalité et à sa mutabilité. Indispensable à l'interprétation de saint Augustin comme penseur non métaphysique, l'analyse de la temporalité de l'homme iconique, en démontrant la manière dont la pensée de la création reste hors de l'ontothéologie et de la causa et de l'ego, suggère en même temps que saint Augustin n'affirme le devenir de l'homme qu'en lui enlevant toute innocence et, corrélativement, ne trouve pas de bonheur véritable dans l'amour du mortel comme tel. Extending the project of his prior theological works, Au lieu de soi distinguishes the thought of creation not only from onto-theology but also from its Heideggerian overcoming, which remains for Marion as idolatrous as metaphysics itself Along these lines, the work turns on the interpretation of the adonné as creature par excellence, or as an iconic creature - whose privilege stems from its temporality and mutability. Indispensable to the interpretation of Saint Augustine as non-metaphysical thinker, the analysis of iconic man's temporality, while demonstrating rigorously the way in which the thought of creation remains beyond the onto-theology both of the causa and of the ego, suggests at the same time that Augustine affirms the becoming of man only in depriving it of all innocence and, correlatively, finds no true happiness in love of the mortal as such.<br>

Author(s): Farber Seth<br>
Abstract: Drawing upon recent developments in epistemology, this work attempts to advance the argument against the use of the medical model in psychology and psychotherapy. This model constitutes a culturally hegemonic interpretation that is epistemologically inadequate and that is an obstacle to the process of psychological change, both outside and within the context of the therapeutic relationship. Phenomena currently interpreted as "psychiatric disorders" can more adequately and constructively be made sense of with the use of categories derived from the cultural understanding of the processes of growth and education. It is proposed that widespread problems of life are not symptoms of an epidemic of mental illness but signs that humanity is involved in a process of evolution.<br>

Author(s): Gimbel Edward W.<br>
Abstract: In this essay, I argue that a common reading of Max Weber's social science and its treatment of interpretation as either insufficiently or excessively "scientific" on the model of the natural sciences is inadequate. Freed from the either/or opposition of naturalism and humanism, and read through the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Weber can be read as offering a way forward for the social sciences that embraces both the subjective orientation of social scientists and the objective aspirations of social science.<br>

Abstract: L'interprétation du Cantique ne fait pas l'unanimité. Il se présente comme une composition polémique en réaction contre l'establishment civil et religieux et les mœurs de l'époque du second Temple. La langue tout entière du Cant, est une sorte de pastiche des traditions bibliques. Elle réutilise les métaphores prophétiques sur l'amour de Dieu et d'Israël dans le sens des relations erotiques d'un homme et d'une femme. Le passage le plus difficile du Cant. est étudié de ce point de vue herméneutique, pour voir s'il s'ouvre à notre investigation. The interpretation of Song of Songs escapes any consensus. Canticles has been written as a polemical piece in reaction against the religious and civil Establishment, and against the prevailing mores in the Second Temple period. The language is through and through a pastiche of sorts of the biblical traditions, thus bringing the prophetic metaphors on the loving relationships between God and Israel back to the human level of eros. The most difficult text of Cant, is explored from the point of view of the hermeneutical thesis, to see if it can be successfully exegeted.<br>

Abstract: La Sagesse personnifiée en Pr 9 est tenue pour une figure féminine. Cette interprétation ne se trouve toutefois pas corroborée par l'étude du chapitre, pas plus que par l'examen des autres passages du livre présentant la Sagesse personnifiée (1,20-33; 8), ou des sept premiers chapitres à l'atmosphère sexuelle et sexuée pourtant prégnante. La Sagesse n'en est pas pour autant masculine: à l'image de Dieu, elle excède toute sexuation. Personified Wisdom in Pr 9 is considered as a feminine figure. This interpretation is nervertheless corroborated neither by the study of this chapter, nor by the analysis of the other passages of the book presenting Personified Wisdom (1,20-33; 8), or of the first seven chapters in which the sexual and gendering atmospher is nevertheless emphasized. However, Wisdom is not masculine: as God, it exceeds all sexual identity.<br>

Abstract: Une réflexion générale sur les concepts linguistiques de diachronie et de synchronie pourrait permettre de porter un nouvel éclairage sur l'herméneutique des textes bibliques. La première partie de cet article décrit donc la genèse et l'évolution de la fameuse dichotomie saussurienne, et son incidence dans l'interprétation des textes. Dans une deuxième étape, les deux catégories de Saussure sont confrontées à d'autres perspectives qui permettent de dépasser la tension entre synchronie et diachronie textuelles, notamment l'approche de Guillaume (endochronie), celle de l'herméneutique antique (métachronie) et celle de la pragmatique (autochronie). Cette comparaison débouche sur une réévaluation de la perspective saussurienne en vue de l'étude du signifié, et notamment de celui des textes bibliques. A consideration of the linguistic concepts of diachrony and synchrony could lead to a greater understanding of Biblical hermeneutics. The first part of this article discusses the origin and the evolution of the well known Saussurian dichotomy, as well as its influence on textual interpretation. In the second part the two Saussurian perspectives are compared with other categories allowing us to go beyond synchronie and diachronie textual opposition: those applied by Guillaume (endochrony), by the first to comment on literary texts (metachrony) and by a pragmatic approach (autochrony). Such a comparison permits us to make a new appraisal of the two Saussurian perspectives in order to achieve a better analysis of the signified, especially with respect to Biblical texts.<br>

Author(s): BAHR HOWARD M.<br>
Abstract: Disciplinary specialties and boundaries may impede as well as facilitate understanding. Standard scholarly orientations to the study of Navajos and other ethnic populations manifest many biases of ethnocentrism and a general tendency to stereotype. Specific observer-related tendencies to distort are noted, among them tendencies to understate social dynamics and the degree to which Navajos are functioning parts of wider social systems. The literature on Navajos is a product of changing tools in the hands of changing observers applied to changing communities in the context of ongoing change in the wider societies of both observer and observed. It is argued that "multiplying glimpses," or increasing the number and types of observers and the variety of disciplines and paradigms represented, may reduce observer and position biases that distort existing views of Navajo society. An overview of the massive literature on the Navajo leads to the identification of 21 distinct genres. These genres and other Navajo texts may profitably be viewed in the perspective of textual analysis, broadly defined. Issues of meaning and interpretation are considered, including the reality-language-text nexus, construction of texts, text-context patterns, and the interaction of text, situation, and analyst in interpretation. Appropriate use of existing texts is socially responsible "green research" and should not be professionally stigmatized. It substitutes resource-efficient recycling of discarded and underanalyzed texts for the old expensive, obtrusive colonial patterns of work.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur examine la thèse du théologien Bernard Hort, « Contingence et intériorité », consacrée à l'œuvre philosophique de Pierre Thévenaz. Après avoir reconnu la légitimité d'une interprétation théologique de la philosophie thévenazienne, D. Müller s'interroge sur l'hypothèse des deux Thévenaz, sur le durcissement hénologique imputé au deuxième Thévenaz et sur la compréhension du protestantisme que B. Hort lui oppose. The article examines the thesis of Bernard Hort, "Contingency and inferiority"', given over to the philosophy of P. Thévenaz. While recognizing the legitimacy of a theological interpretation of Thévenaz, Müller questions the hypothesis of the two Thévenaz', the henological hardening attributed to the second Thévenaz and the understanding of Protestantism with which Hort opposes Thévenaz.<br>

Abstract: Issu des recherches d'une quinzaine d'exégètes, cet ouvrage, de style universitaire, est destiné à présenter à un large public un panorama des recherches johanniques contemporaines. Très diversifié quant aux thèmes abordés, il introduira lectrices et lecteurs aux questions irrésolues que pose l'histoire des communautés johanniques et de leur production littéraire. De nombreux auteurs s'interrogent sur la signification des relectures et des retouches successives. Ainsi, l'ouvrage rejoint l'aspect le plus énigmatique du corpus johannique (évangile et épîtres). Les écrits johanniques ont été dès l'origine et demeurent au centre de conflits d'interprétations; de ces conflits, comme des hypothèses les plus diverses, le livre a le mérite de rendre compte. Ainsi, il se montre digne de figurer parmi les ouvrages de référence sur ce sujet. This collection, the work of fifteen exegetes and edited by Kaestli, Poffet and Zumstein, presents a panorama of contemporary Johannine research for the benefit of the larger public. Touching upon many themes, it introduces the reader to the unresolved questions concerning the Johannine communities and their literature. Several authors question the significance of rereadings and successive alterations, the most enigmatic aspect of the Johannine corpus (gospel and epistles). The collection has the merit of presenting the diverse hypothesis and conflicts of interpretation to which Johannine writings have always been exposed, and should figure amongst the works of reference on the subject.<br>

Abstract: S'inspirant de travaux menés à l'Institut de recherches herméneutiques et systématiques de Neuchâtel, l'article esquisse quelques implications résultant d'une approche herméneutique du dialogue entre science et foi. Partant de l'extension du phénomène de l'interprétation, il réfléchit aux conditions du travail interdisciplinaire et à l'accent interactionnel qui en résulte. Il aborde ensuite la question d'un tiers d'ancrage pour science et foi, ce qui le conduit à une réflexion sur la dialectique entre Ecriture et expérience. Inspired by recent work at the Research institute of hermeneutics and systematics in Neuchatel, this article delineates some implications of a hermeneutical approach to the dialogue between science and faith. From the enlargment of the import of interpretation, it goes on to discuss the prerequisites of interdisciplinary work and the resultant interactional emphasis. Interaction requires a common grounding, an anchorage outside both science and faith. As experience, this leads the theologian to the challenge of the dialectic between Scripture and experience.<br>

Abstract: Contrairement à certains préjugés laïcistes radicaux, la question de Dieu est au cœur de l'éthique. Or les débats actuels de la bioéthique ne permettent pas toujours d'identifier clairement la pertinence de cette question. Afin de parvenir à une reformulation crédible de la contribution de l'éthique théologique à la discussion publique, il importe d'interroger les différentes manières de comprendre la relation entre les catégories d'immanence et de transcendance. En dialogue critique avec H. Tristram Engelhardt, l'auteur balise les conditions fondamentales d'accès à une interprétation de Dieu comme mystère du monde et de l'existence et donc aussi comme horizon indépassable de toute éthique. Contrary to certain radical lay prejudices, the question of God is at the heart of ethics. Yet current debates on bioethics do not always help to clearly identify the pertinence of the question. To reformulate the contribution of theological ethics to public discussion in a credible way, we must examine the different ways of understanding the relationship between immanence and transcendance. In critical dialogue with H. Tristram Engelhardt, the author marks out the basic conditions to access an interpretation of God as mystery of the world and of existance, thus also as the impassable horizon of all ethics.<br>

Abstract: L'homme déchiffre l'énigme de sa sexualité dans des cadres herméneutiques qui la qualifient ou à la disqualifient. La domination du cadre technoscientifique sert aujourd'hui à qualifier la sexualité dans les mots de l'efficacité (la performance), de la réduction biomédicale (précaution et contagion) et de l'évaluation légale et judiciaire (la déviance). Face à ce premier cadre, peut-on faire valoir ce qui, dans notre culture, initie et invente une interprétation plus riche et plus complexe, susceptible de raconter et de se représenter la sexualité Ne néglige-t-on pas souvent l'importance d'une poétique et d'une herméneutique des images servant une augmentation iconique de la sexualité ? Humans decipher the enigma of their sexuality in hermeneutical frameworks that qualify or disqualify it. The dominance of the techno-scientific framework serves today to qualify sexuality in words of efficiency (performance), bio-medical reduction (precaution and contagion) and legal and juridical evaluation (deviance). In the face of this first framework, can we give value to what, in our culture, initiates and invents a richer and more complex interpretation, susceptible to the telling and representing ofsexuality? Do we not often neglect the importance of the poetical and hermeneutical of images serving an iconic augmentation of sexuality?<br>

Article Title: L'ÂME ENTRE CORPS ET ESPRIT: Le concept husserlien de soubassement à la lumière de la phénoménologie matérielle de Michel Henry<br>
Publisher: PCL PRESSES CENTRALES SA<br>
Issue: i40182176<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Michel Beat<br>
Abstract: L'œuvre de Michel Henry aura été de «recueillir» et développer le côté affectif de la phénoménologie, que Husserl, dans un passage clé de ses Idées directrices, a délaissé au profit du côté intentionnel de la subjectivité — tout comme trois siècles plus tôt Descartes avait «recueilli» la subjectivité écartée par Galilée. Le texte qui suit compare le concept de soubassement, ou âme, chez Husserl avec celui de chair chez Michel Henry. On verra que les deux philosophes parlent d'une couche sensible, qu'on peut d'une certaine manière situer entre corps et esprit, de deux points de vue diamétralement opposés. Au-delà de l'opposition entre les deux philosophies, cette recherche mène à une interprétation topologique du rapport entre corps, âme et esprit, tel que suggéré par le terme husserlien de soubassement, et propose un éclairage différent de la notion henryenne d'auto-affection. Michel Henry's objective was to "pick up" and develop the emotional side of phenomenology, which Husserl, in a key passage in Ideas, left aside in favour of the intentional side of subjectivity — just as Descartes, three centuries earlier, "picked up" subjectivity left aside by Galileo. In this article, we compare the concept of the sub-basement, or soul, for Husserl, with that of the body for Michel Henry. We will see that both philosophers speak of a sensitive layer that can be situated in a certain manner between body and spirit, from two diametrically opposite points of view. Beyond the opposition of the two philosophies, this research leads to a topological interpretation of the relation between body, soul and spirit, as suggested by Husserl's term sub-basement, and proposes a different light on Henry's notion of self-affection.<br>

Abstract: La question des rapports entre éthique philosophique et éthique théologique est au cœur de la pensée de Friedrich Daniel Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposant une conception originale de la raison dans ses liens à la nature et à l'histoire, l'auteur des Discours et de la Foi chrétienne restructure l'éthique philosophique autour des notions de Biens, de vertus et de devoirs. Quels liens une telle vision de l'éthique entretient-elle avec l'interprétation théologique de thèmes comme le Royaume de Dieu, la rédemption, la justification par la foi et la sanctification ? La concentration téléologique sur les Biens (Güterlehre) et sur le Bien suprême est-elle à comprendre aussi en un sens théologique ? Et si oui, comment penser la relation entre la dogmatique, la dialectique et l'éthique, non seulement chez Schleiermacher, mais dans le contexte moderne et postmoderne qui est le nôtre ? The relation between philosophical and theological ethics is at the centre of the thought of F. D. Schleiermacher (1768-1834). Proposing an original conception of reason in its connection to nature and to history, the author of Discourses and of The Christian Faith restructures philosophical ethics around the notions of the Good, of virtues and of duties. What connection does such a vision of ethics have with the theological interpretation of themes like the Kingdom of god, redemption, justification by faith and sanctification? Can the teleological focus on the Good fGüterlehrej andón the supreme Good be also understood theologically? If yes, how should one think of the relation between dogmatics, dialectics and ethics, not only in Schleiermacher, but in the modern and postmodern context of our age?<br>

Abstract: Les interrogations sur l'éthique minimale sont de trois ordres. Il y a d'abord des divergences dans l'interprétation des grands auteurs de référence, en particulier de Kant et de John Stuart Mill. Il y a ensuite des objections conceptuelles à la critique minimaliste des devoirs moraux envers soi-même. Il y a, enfin, des oppositions aux engagements libéraux de l'éthique minimale en matière de bioéthique entre autres. Les commentaires visent essentiellement à écarter certains malentendus et à évaluer les modifications qu'il faudrait apporter à l'éthique minimale pour qu'elle soulève moins d'objections. The questions put to minimalist ethics are of three types. First there are divergences in the interpretation of the authors of reference, notably of Kant and John Stuart Mill. Then there are conceptual objections to the minimalist criticism of moral obligations to oneself. Finally, there is opposition to the liberal commitments of minimalist ethics to, amongst others matters, bioethics. These comments aim essentially to eliminate certain misunderstandings and to evaluate the necessary modifications so that minimalist ethics would raise fewer objections.<br>

Issue: i40184912<br>
Date: 1 1, 1973<br>
Author(s): Greisch Jean<br>
Abstract: La question de la métaphore se pose à trois niveaux: celui de l'analyse sémantique (philosophie analytique du langage), celui de sa fonction herméneutique (Paul Ricœur), enfin la question proprement « ontologique » de sa portée pour l'ensemble du discours philosophique comme tel. L'étude présente est une contribution à cette dernière problématique, envisagée à partir du discours de Martin Heidegger. L'étude se fait en trois étapes : liquidation de la représentation métaphysique de la métaphore; la métaphore dans le discours philosophique de Heidegger; retour d'une nouvelle problématique de la métaphore, autour du couple métaphore morte/métaphore vivante. The question of metaphor in philosophy may be asked in three different ways: analysis of its function (anglo-saxon philosophy of language); link with the problem of interpretation (hermeneutics); finally the « ontological » question of its meaning for philosophical discourse as such. The present study is a contribution to the latter question, focused on the philosophy of Martin Heidegger. The question is developped in threee steps: elimination of the metaphysical conception of metaphor; the metaphor inside the philosophical discourse of Heidegger; come-back of a new conception of metaphor, which has not yet been completely shaped out, but which must be related to the opposition of dead and living metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Animés d'ambitions philosophiques opposées et armés de moyens conceptuels fort différents, Thomas d'Aquin et Martin Heidegger, selon une interprétation courante, n'en seraient pas moins parvenus à une même intuition fondamentale : celle de la différence ontologique, et de son caractère central en métaphysique, l'Aquinate n'étant par conséquent pas coupable d'avoir confondu l'être et l'étant, ainsi que le reproche lui en avait été fait par le philosophe allemand. On veut ici montrer à partir d'une analyse de textes heideggeriens appartenant essentiellement à la période 1930-1950 ainsi qu'un échantillon représentatif de textes thomistes que l'ontologie de l'Aquinate dont il apparaîtrait que Heidegger ne l'aurait pas comprise dans sa spécificité et son originalité, n'en appartient pas moins à l'histoire de la métaphysique telle que caractérisée par Heidegger et telle qu'il invite à la dépasser. According to a common interpretation, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Heidegger, though moved by opposing philosophical ambitions and having very different conceptual tools, arrived nonetheless at the same fundamental intuition: that of ontological difference, and of its importance in metaphysics. Aquinas is therefore not guilty of confusing esse with ens, for which the German philosopher had reproached him. By analyzing Heideggerian texts dating essentially from the years 1930-1950, together with a representative sampling of Thomist texts, the A. would like to show that Aquinas's ontology of which Heidegger had apparently not understood the specificity nor the originality, belongs just the same to the history of Metaphysics as characterized by Heidegger and such as he would have us go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: L'auteur se propose de vérifier l'affirmation de Lavelle selon laquelle l'ouvrage de 1937, De l'Acte, se serait progressivement développé comme une synthèse complète de sa philosophie. Or il existe, à l'état dactylographié, une version antérieure de ce livre, qui permet de comprendre combien l'aisance presque trop grande des analyses de 1937 cache en fait une élaboration lente et un effort continu. La version inédite insiste sur l'intemporalité transcendantale de l'acte, et sur l'impersonnalité de l'acte fondateur de toutes les existences personnelles. Ces thèses seront abandonnées en 1937. On analyse ensuite l'article « Être et Acte » et la conférence de la société française de philosophie sur « Acte créateur et acte réflexif », où est discutée la position de Jean Nabert. Les thèses de De l'Acte montrent une progression de l'identité de l'être et de l'acte (dans l'acte d'être) jusqu'à l'acte en sa forme la plus haute, l'acte d'amour. Situer cette œuvre capitale implique qu'on ait bien compris l'interprétation du sensible comme de la donnée matérielle qui doit être spiritualisée. L'expérience extérieure du sensible s'oppose à l'expérience intérieure de l'esprit. Et l'acte est l'œuvre de l'être spirituel. L'ontologie dynamique de Lavelle est une affirmation de la liberté humaine comme participation à l'acte créateur divin. Divin ou humain, l'être est subjectif parce que libre. Ainsi Lavelle s'inscrit dans la tradition platonicienne moderne, celle d'Avicenne d'abord, celle de Hegel ensuite. The author proposes to verify Lavelle's assertion that the 1937 work, De l'Acte, would be progressively developed as a complete synthesis of his philosophy. Now there exists in typewritten state an earlier version of this book, which allows us to see the extent to which the almost excessive facility of analyses of 1937 in fact conceals a slow development and a continuous effort. The unedited version insists upon the transcendental atemporality of act, and upon the impersonality of ~<br>

Article Title: DESCARTES SELON L'ORDRE DE LA RAISON HERMÉNEUTIQUE : LE « MOMENT CARTÉSIEN » CHEZ MICHEL HENRY, MARTIN HEIDEGGER ET PAUL RICŒUR<br>

Abstract: La philosophie herméneutique contemporaine comporte, dans sa démarche fondamentale, une rencontre avec la pensée fondatrice de Descartes que l'on peut nommer son « moment cartésien ». Celle thèse est vérifiée successivement à propos de la « phénoménologie matérielle » de Michel Henry, directement liée à une interprétation du cogito cartésien développée dans la Généalogie de la psychanalyse ; puis en dégageant les motifs herméneutiques impliqués dans la critique du cogito développée par Heidegger; enfin en analysant, dans la phénoménologie herméneutique de Paul Ricœur, la signification du « cogito blessé » , par rapport au conflit des interprétations et dans les perspectives de l'identité narrative pour une nouvelle conception du sujet. In making its fundamental approach, contemporary interpretative philosophy inevitably encounters the basic thinking of Descartes, resulting in what may be called a « Cartesian touch ». Successive examples of this are to be found in (1) Michel Henry's "physical-object phenomenology", which is directly linked with one interpretation of the Cartesian cogito developed in The Genealogy of Psycho-analysis; then in (2) Heidegger's critique of the cogito, if one isolates the interpretative aims which are implied therein; and finally in (3) Paul Ricœur's interpretative phenomenology, if one analyses the meaning of the "wounded cogito", bearing in mind the conflict of interpretation and the possibility that the identical data could give rise to new conclusions on the subject.<br>

Abstract: P. Ricœur établit une relation méthodologique entre l'épistémologie et la phénoménologie herméneutique, en considérant l'épistémologie comme une médiation entre la phénoménologie et l'herméneutique. Cette considération de l'épistémologie en tant que médiation est profondément liée à la notion spécifique de « texte » chez P. Ricœur. Cet article montre que même si la philosophie de Ricœur ne traite pas de l'épistémologie des sciences de la nature, celle-ci peut être approfondie par une phénoménologie herméneutique : la phénoménologie éclaire la naissance du réseau conceptuel d'une théorie; l'épistémologie éclaire sa structure intérieure; l'herméneutique éclaire son interprétation et la liaison avec la réalité physique. P. Ricœur establishes a methodological relationship between epistemology and hermeneutical phenomenology, considering epistemology as mediation between phenomenology and hermeneutics. Ricœur's consideration of epistemology as mediation is profoundly related to his specific notion of text. This paper shows that even if Ricœur's philosophy does not refer to the epistemology of natural sciences, the latter can be deepened by hermeneutical phenomenology : phenomenology clarifies the birth of a conceptual network of a theory; epistemology clarifies its internal structure; hermeneutics clarifies its interpretation and its relation with physical reality.<br>

Article Title: A Copper Rule versus the Golden Rule: A Daoist-Confucian Proposal for Global Ethics<br>
Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
Issue: i405203<br>
Date: 7 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Wattles Yong<br>
Abstract: Here a moral principle called the "Copper Rule" is developed and defended as an alternative to the Golden Rule. First, the article focuses on two problems with the Golden Rule's traditional formulation of "Do (or don't do) unto others what you would (or would not) have them do unto you": it assumes (1) the uniformity of human needs and preferences and (2) that whatever is universally desired is good. Second, it examines three attempts to reformulate the Golden Rule-Marcus Singer's general interpretation, Allan Gewirth's rationalization, and R. M. Hare's imaginative role reversal-to show why they all fail to save the Golden Rule from difficulty. Third, the rich resources of the Chinese Confucian-Daoist philosophical traditions are appropriated to develop a "Copper Rule" as an alternative moral principle: "Do (or don't do) unto others as they would (or would not) have us do unto them." This moral principle not only avoids the two problems, but also has additional advantages. Finally, the "Copper Rule" is defended against three objections or counterarguments: what if people ask you (for example) (1) to kill someone else, (2) to kill them, or (3) to kill yourself? The appropriate response is merely to trace the implications of the "Copper Rule" rather than add any ad hoc arguments.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219755<br>

Author(s): Toulmin Paul B.<br>
Abstract: The debate about validity in interpretation has pitted monism against pluralism. Some theorists insist that any literary work has a single, determinate meaning, and others argue that there are no limits to the readings a text allows. Neither view adequately describes the field of conflicting interpretations. Critics can and do have legitimate disagreements about literary works; yet we can also say that some readings are wrong, not simply different. The hermeneutic field is divided among conflicting systems of interpretation, each based on different presuppositions that decide what its procedures will disclose and what they will disguise. But several tests for validity-inclusiveness, efficacy, and intersubjectivity-act as constraints on reading and regulate claims to legitimacy. While these tests have limitations that prevent them from resolving all hermeneutic disagreements, literary criticism is nevertheless a rational, disciplined enterprise-though an inherently pluralistic one.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219784<br>
Date: 3 1, 1957<br>
Author(s): Woollcombe Regina M.<br>
Abstract: The Hebrew Bible depicts interpretation as a continual process of losing and finding, of forgetting and remembering. Texts are lost and found, and in the Joseph story (Gen. 37-50), Joseph himself is abandoned and recovered, with all memory of him repressed until it is dramatically recalled. His story demonstrates that repression is the condition of interpretation, and that interpretation-not resurrection-holds forth the promise of a future life. Nonetheless, the repeated losses that punctuate the Joseph narrative have inspired the opposite conclusion: that Joseph is a type of Jesus, that his descents and ascents prefigure the final one. Typology, a mode of biblical interpretation that prevailed during the early church, has enjoyed a recent revival in the context of literary studies; but I argue that the typological language of "fulfillment," of shadows and truth, is alien to Hebraic-and postmodern-understandings of textuality.<br>

Article Title:  Mīmāṃsā and the Problem of History in Traditional India <br>
Publisher: American Oriental Society<br>
Issue: i225333<br>
Date: 12 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Feenberg Sheldon<br>
Abstract: The long-held view concerning the absence of a historical understanding in traditional India merits reconsideration on the basis of recent scholarship on the notion of history as such, the rhetorical foundations of historiography, the nature of narrativity, the character of historiography in classical antiquity, and the actual historical documents that are available from premodern India. Yet the absence of a historical-referential dimension of Sanskrit discourse remains a serious problem, one that Mīmāṃsā views on the referential sphere of the Veda may help us to understand. Mīmāṃsā makes the authority of the Veda dependent on its timelessness, and thus must empty the Veda of its historical referentiality. Since learned discourse (śāstra) in general is subject to a process of "vedicization," it adopts the Veda's putative ahistoricality; and the same set of concerns comes to inform the understanding of the genre itihāsa ("history") and the interpretation of itihāsa texts. History, consequently, seems not so much to be unknown in Sanskritic India as to be denied.<br>

Article Title: Place and Space: A Lefebvrian Reconciliation<br>
Publisher: Institute of British Geographers<br>
Issue: i225701<br>
Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Werlen Andrew<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a dialectical interpretation of place. It argues that much of the confusion in the literature on place stems from its failure to engage with the ontological nature of place. This has led to much research implicitly accepting a restrictive Cartesian view of socio-spatial reality. Entrikin's (1991) 'betweenness of place' thesis is a notable recent illustration. In this paper I suggest that the problematic nature of place and its relationship to space can be resolved through a dialectical mode of argumentation. The spatialized dialectic of Henri Lefebvre offers a fruitful framework for reconciling the interaction between place and space insofar as it strives to overcome dualistic conceptions of capitalist spatiality. Lefevbre's dialectical approach will be counterposed to Entrikin's argument. The paper concludes by outlining the implications of the respective perspectives for robust place theorization and place politics.<br>

Author(s): Zabus Clive<br>
Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i201461<br>
Date: 12 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Traverso Regina M.<br>
Abstract: This article investigates the exchanges of letters of 1987 between the historians Martin Broszat and Saul Friedlander through the interpretive framework of "dialogue." It is suggested that dialogue does not have a dyadic structure, but involves ever shifting Thirds that function as mediators in dialogue, i.e., God, conscience, reason, or tradition. On one hand, Thirds provide a seemingly stable, external reference point; on the other hand, they open up space for the play of power and desire. Four categories of Thirds are identified and their place and role in the dialogue between Broszat and Friedlander analyzed. The psychoanalytically inspired notions of "acting-out" and "working-through" are employed in order to interpret the varying degrees of critical control Broszat and Friedlander were able to apply to these interfering Thirds. Finally, I give an overall interpretation of Broszat's and Friedlander's positions in the dialogue, guided by the concepts of acting-out and working-through.<br>

Author(s): Tuan Miles<br>
Abstract: This article describes how the people of Cartago, Costa Rica -- compelled, like each of us, to create -- incorporate the material culture of their town's market and plaza into social situations. In so doing, they move from the physical reality of simply being there to the distinctive social realities of being-in-the-market and being-in-the-plaza. The juxtaposition of these two complementary realities, the article concludes, constitutes the dialectic through which Spanish American culture becomes.

Issue: i226373<br>
Date: 8 1, 1972<br>
Author(s): Yates Ellen<br>
Abstract: Adopting a reflexive approach, this article interprets a recently created healing ritual in Brittany that integrates local 19th-century notions about the curative powers of prehistoric monuments with diverse elements from non-Breton sources. Parallels are noted between this New Age therapy and witchcraft, an older explanatory framework for illness and misfortune in Brittany. The therapeutic discourse associated with the ritual draws on the past and on exotic cultures to construct a meaningful cosmology. Therefore, this discourse--like the New Age movement as a whole--has much in common with anthropology, which, it is suggested, provides Western society with an ordered vision of the world.

Author(s): Verhaar Gary<br>
Abstract: This study describes the symbolic process by which individuals attempted to realize, in organizational form, their variant interpretations of an extended metaphor - community mental health. Their metaphoric construals were embedded in everyday discourse and were initially unrecognized by participants at a community mental health center. The metaphoric process, that is, the movement involving the emergence, interpretation, and realization of these metaphors, was mediated by the self-images of the participants. They had embarked upon an innovative project to realize, in part, an ideal sense of self. The latter was a key factor in the development of new construals of community mental health and the implementation of these construals.<br>

Publisher: American Anthropological Association<br>
Issue: i227576<br>

Author(s): Williams Anne M.<br>
Abstract: Recent narrative analysis in medical anthropology provides keys to both the personal meaning of illness and the historical, cultural, and institutional shaping of that experience. Yet Western psychiatric thinking and practice continue to view schizophrenic discourse as closed to interpretation. Caught in this "closed text," the self would seem obliterated. But using narratives of schizophrenia and homelessness, this essay proposes a different understanding of schizophrenic alterity. The openness of the text-as-experience is re-created collectively, from outside the subject's narration: the subject's "self" is construction through the added perspectives of his or her interlocutors in the role of storymakers.<br>

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: Heinrich Schenker's system can be read as narrative purveyed in the traditional genres of drama and epic. We begin with a discussion and critique of recent music-narrative studies and then propose a historicist interpretation of Schenker's work that concentrates on its ideological agenda. Finally, we respond to his system by displacing, expanding, and rewriting segments of its conceptual framework to permit multiple readings of a musical text (specifically, a brief fivefinger exercise by Carl Czerny) and to illustrate our contention that the so-called intrinsic value of an artwork has nothing to do with its internal relationships and everything to do with the expertise of the professional interpreter.<br>

Abstract: Graph-related practices are central to scientific endeavors, and graphing has long been hailed as one of the core "general process skills" that set scientists apart. We use two case studies from a large study among scientists to exemplify our findings that graphing is not a context-independent skill. Rather, scientists' competencies with respect to graph interpretation are highly contextual and are a function of their familiarity with the phenomena to which the graph pertains. If graphing practices are not general but are tied to embodied understandings and familiarity with representation practices, then there are implications for teaching graphing in school mathematics and science settings.<br>

Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: Studies of gender in the XIX century have privileged women writers. To approach these discourses there are several theories in the literary and feminist fields. However, this incidence of class, race, sex in gender relations and in the formation of feminine subjectivities is a theme which has been less studied. In this article I aim to relate these concepts with a focus on Black and Brown-skinned slaves, without abandoning the wider social interpretation. The written sources on this issue are fragmentary, in addition to distortions suffered by the interpretation of a third person: public prosecutor, liquidator of slaves, scribe and even historians and editors who participated in the organization of these written sources. The study presented deals with the processes of transformation of gender relations and feminine subjectivities with the unusual increase in the number of slaves in the nineteenth century Cuban.<br>

Abstract: Introduced in France since a decade, the work of Moishe Postone appears as a global new interpretation of Marx. It hinges on the thesis according to which Marx does not propose a criticism of capitalism from the angle of work, but a criticism of work under capitalism. This article assesses the significance of this heterodox Marxism by trying to situate its epistemological background between a structuralist interpretation and a phenomenological interpretation of Marx. It shows that Postone builds an original structuralism, combining Althusser and Hegel, but struggles to link it up with a theory of subjectivation and action up to a thought which aims for the social transformation of and the emancipation from capitalism.<br>

Abstract: This study presents an interpretation of the configuration of the poetic subject in the books of poems El Primer Libro (1985) and Albricia (1988) by Soledad Fariña (1943), which understand a self in a continuous process of gestation and birth. This process serves the purpose of recomposing a disarticulated subjectivity lost in the framework of the political and cultural conditions imposed by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile in the 1970s and 1980s. By using a metaphor of a journey and searching for a new language, the subject attempts to access a primitive stage andfind its maternal self in order to confront the dominant power, by codifying and configuring herself through an otherness in a feminine body-text. However, this process of maturation and discovery is intervened and left incomplete by the impulse of modernity, thereby creating a deformed, dissociated and off-centered self, which aims at growing opposed to logos. This conflict turns the upcoming of the new self into a painful event, like giving birth, that stems from the subject's wounded and fractured body, intending to re-establish de selffrom its fragments, traces and memories.<br>

Abstract: The literary field in Africa came into emergence as a result of a collective yearning for lesser dependency on the symbolic constraints the Western center is forcing on its margins. Granted that a work sets itself up by setting up its own context, and that the African context stands out as one where oral literature is still alive in society, the manifestation of expressive forms associated with traditional literature in a novel must carry heavy weight in an interpretation of African works. For that reason, this essay will argue that, through her “smuggling” of narrative forms drawn from oral literature, Aminata Sow Fall's fiction testifies to an oral discursivity at work in the novel. The archi-textual approach focuses on various strategies the Senegalese woman writer resorts to in order to inscribe, deep within her creative work in French, a traditional universe hitherto conveyed through oral forms of expression.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews recent methodological interventions in the field of literary study, many of which take nineteenth-century critics, readers, or writers as models for their less interpretive reading practices. In seeking out nineteenth-century models for twenty-first-century critical practice, these critics imagine a world in which English literature never became a discipline. Some see these new methods as formalist, yet we argue that they actually emerge from historicist self-critique. Specifically, these contemporary critics view the historicist projects of the 1980s as overly influenced by disciplinary models of textual interpretation—models that first arose, we show through our reading of the Jolly Bargemen scene in Charles Dickens's
         Great Expectations(1860– 61), in the second half of the nineteenth century. In closing, we look more closely at the work of a few recent critics who sound out the metonymic, adjacent, and referential relations between readers, texts, and historical worlds in order sustain historicism's power to restore eroded meanings rather than reveal latent ones.<br>

Article Title: Poetry Is Theft<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: complitstudies.51.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: According to the arguments put forward by Perloff, Dworkin, Goldsmith, and Reed, the recontextualization of language is a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment, and therefore a sign of genius. Perloff writes, “
      According to taste: it is important to remember that the citational or appropriative text, however unoriginal its actual words and phrases, is always the product of choice—and hence of individual taste.”
            In this interpretation, the appropriation of language becomes the reassertion of individuality and authority. Goldsmith terms this “self-expression,” “emotion,” and “authorship” in24
         Uncreative Writing. Perloff argues, “If the new ‘conceptual’ poetry makes no claim to originality—at least not originality in the usual sense—this is not to say thatgeniusisn't in play. It just takes different forms.”
            The rhetoric of Perloff and Goldsmith's claims is fascinating. Viewing the recontextualization of language as a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment is a hoary basis for authority. Attributing the act of recontextualizing to “genius” reinforces the fetish of authenticity that reigns in late capitalist society25
         
            and is a clear manifestation of the metaphysics of origin.26
         
            By “metaphysics of origin,” I refer to the central epistemic issue that creates a theology of “the new, the creative, the true” in the West, following Françoise Meltzer's analysis in27
         Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality. Meltzer shows that the idea of literary originality functions within an economy of displacement: that is, the idea of “origin” itself is continually displaced so as “to clothe its status as invention, or myth.”
            Said has identified a similar phenomenon that he calls the “imperative connection” between the idea of a beginning and the “aboriginal human need to point to or locate a beginning.”28

Abstract: The concrete details of the man and woman who have been humiliated by their fellow humans should trouble every person who lives safely in their warm houses. Levi, however, urges these individuals further to
         
               As Nicholas Patruno argues inMeditate that this came about:
               I commend these words to you,
               Carve them in your hearts
               At home, in the streets,
               Going to bed, rising;
               Repeat them to your children. (9)
            Understanding Primo Levi, this epigraphic poem, written in January 1946, is a “loosely paraphrased interpretation of one of the most often invoked Hebrew prayers, the Shema” (9). The imperative not to forget is a well-known component of Jewish history and culture. Remembrance is the holy grail of survival. Conversely, to forget is to subject oneself to extinction. For Patruno, the title of the poem is intended to raise a “rhetorical question of conscience whose impact is so powerful that any reply would be superfluous” (10). Jonathan Druker contends in “Ethics and Ontology in Primo Levi's ‘Survival in Auschwitz’: A Levinasian Reading,” that the ethical import of Primo Levi's memoir is highlighted by the poem, which “commands the ‘safe’ reader, surrounded by ‘friendly faces,’ to reflect on whether the dehumanized victim, unable to assert his or her own subjectivity, is yet a human being for whom the reader is responsible” (533). Druker, alluding to Emmanuel Levinas, further points out that “the human face is the focal point of the poem's gaze as the ‘friendly faces’ (visi amici) of the first stanza give way to the dehumanized victim's blank stare ‘her eyes empty’; (vuoti gli occhi)” (534).<br>

Abstract: Having chosen to emphasize the ethnographic literature, the author made the further decision to embrace the entire continent in his survey. To exclude Egypt, Ethiopia, and North Africa, as has commonly been done, could only have the effect of obscuring the influences which have impinged on Negro Africa from the north and northeast and of injecting an element of unnecessary guesswork into their interpretation. To exclude Madagascar, moreover, would eliminate a prime source of information concerning the cultural impact on Africa of contacts with India and Malaysia by way of the ancient monsoon trade across the Indian Ocean.”

Abstract: When the concept of responsibility moves into philosophy proper in the nineteenth century, it is not as an ethical concept but, rather, as a political one, which again refers to principles of law and government, specifically punishment, or what John Stuart Mill calls “punishability” and what F. H. Bradley calls “accountability” (see McKeon
      1957, 6–7). Paul Ricoeur traces this slippage in the juridical concept of responsibility as attribution to that of retribution through the termaccount, which links imputation to responsibility.
            In Ricoeur's terms, responsibility as accountability suggests “the idea of a kind of moral bookkeeping of merits and demerits, as in a double-entry ledger: receipts and expenses, credits and debits,” wherein “the metaphor of a balance book seems to underlie” both being accountable for and giving an account, in the sense of recounting (2000, 14). In other words, in its juridical origins, responsibility is a matter of calculation and accounting on the scales of justice such that punishments are compensations or payments for crimes committed. Ricoeur points out that responsibility owes its associations with payment to the theological context that takes us back to Saint Paul's interpretation of the crucifixion of Christ as payment for original sin.4<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: That period (1980–81) symbolized the end of the “then” period. Critical theory, with its close ties to the interpretation of Marx, was no longer front and center. But the idea of critique was still alive, or at least we thought that it could be kept alive given the ominous truth of criticism that associated critique and ideology (Gadamer). At least we tried. Some four years after the publication of the first issue of
            Cultural Hermeneutics, Reidel, the publisher, suddenly and with little warning discontinued the journal. Whether it was Reidel's penchant for the good life or that we were the lowest journal in the hierarchy I never knew, but this much was clear, unless something unusual happened my life as a journal editor was over. As I was mulling over what to do, a process that took months, I received a late-night call from a former graduate student who was on his way to a distinguished career. His question was simple: “Dave, if you give up, where are we going to get published?” I took the question seriously; I bit the bullet, as it were—whoever said something could not be created out of nothing—and I started a publishing company to privately publish my journal. And by the most unusual stroke of luck I and the grad students associated with me at the time changed the nameCultural HermeneuticstoPhilosophy and Social Criticism. Unbelievably the phrase “social criticism” had not yet caught the public's imagination, and the choice of title was a stroke of pure luck. Significantly this change of title marked a transition in my view of critical theory, as reflected in the new editorial statement: “In modern industrial society reason cannot be separated from practical life. At their interface a critical attitude is forged.” The statement, which now sounds a bit passé, though I still keep it on the masthead, takes its distance from the earlier phase of critical theory. No revolution in the nineteenth-century historical sense is to be expected here. Social critici~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Three years later in the next edition of selected SPEP papers the editors, Ronald Bruzina and Bruce Wilshire, noted an article by David Allison, “Structuralism Revisited: Levi Straus and Diachrony.”
         
               They suggested that to understand it the reader would need to draw from knowledge of Heidegger, Derrida, Deleuze, and Ricoeur. They also noted a paper by Matthieu Casalis, “Hermeneutics, Death of God, and Dissolution of the Subject: A Phenomenological Appraisal,” that indicates a growing challenge to what we could call a strong tendency toward totalization in some aspect of phenomenological thought, as well as the high stakes that are at issue. Interest in Marxist thought and critical theory as well as in social science also intensified during the 1970s, and by the end of the decade papers in these areas were common, while papers also emerged on politics and political action. The currents crossing the phenomenological mainstream were now strong and, for some members, challenging in a disconcerting way that most people in SPEP in the 1960s could not have imagined. Many people who were deeply impacted by the civil rights struggle (in spite of the absence in SPEP of a significant presence of people of color), the Vietnam War protests, and the growing awareness of colonialism and gender inequality were taking philosophy in the context of phenomenology and existentialism out of the modern transcendental and metaphysical domain, some by direct challenges to interpretations of canonical texts and others by setting new directions that arose out of contemporary problems and concern for social justice. Social-historical factors and careful analyses of narrative forms began to replace epistemology as leading interests, and these factors and forms often replaced metaphysical foundations in their work. “Humanism” became increasingly a problem rather than an unquestioned term concerning human life and the context of its interpretation.4<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: 1979. I list this date because it was the year several books were published that changed the interpretation of technologies for our era.
                  Laboratory Life, by Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979), shifted the interpretation of both science and technology to a praxis-oriented and materially sensitive interpretation. Latour followed up withScience in Action(1987), in which instruments played crucial roles in producing scientific facts. The year 1979 was also when the analytic philosopher Mario Bunge, in “Five Buds of Techno-philosophy,” pronounced that while technologies ought to occupy philosophical attention, to date, he claimed, there had not been a single monograph on the philosophy of technology. But this was also the year of my ownTechnics and Praxis: A Philosophy of Technology(1979), jointly published by the Boston Philosophy of Science and Synthese Library series. It, too, took a praxis turn, with a look at how science is materiallyembodiedin technologies. Later it was cited as the first philosophy of technology book from North America and contained the first English overview of Heidegger's philosophy of technology. And externally, this was also the year of the Iranian revolution, a primary information technology of which was the cassette recorder, which carried the ayatollah's and mullah's messages and which was small and decentralized compared with other media. This miniaturized-decentralized technology is one dimension of the New Technologies.<br>

Abstract: The movement from
            thentonow, so far as ethics and philosophy of religion are concerned, can be largely told in relation to five proper names: Ricoeur, Levinas, Kierkegaard, Derrida, and Marion. Paul Ricoeur was already part ofthen, but as he kept writing, so broadly and so deeply, he became more and more an inescapable part of thenow. The problem is that he did this in so many different ways that he could easily take up all my time and space and then some. Not just in such collections asThinking BiblicallyandFiguring the Sacredbut whenever he wrote about virtually anything, be it time and narrative, memory, metaphor, interpretation, translation, ideology, evil, justice, the self (as other), recognition, or whatever, he provoked our thought about either ethics or religion or both. So, with gratitude and apologies, I'll leave him as the one who has shaped ournow, so far as ethics and religion are concerned, in more different but deep ways than anyone else. He is in any case more important for the first revolution than for the second.<br>

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: A good model for envisioning how a hermeneutic phenomenology would engage Deleuze can be developed by drawing from resources established elsewhere in Ricoeur's thought. What I have in mind, specifically, is his reading of Freud in the book
         Freud and Philosophy.
               There Ricoeur reads Freud's work as “a mixed or even ambiguous discourse, which at times states conflicts of force subject to an energetics, at times relations of meaning subject to a hermeneutics.”22
            
               Freud's energetics, on the one hand, offers a naturalistic account of desire in which it is understood in terms of a cathexis—the placement and displacement of energy. And yet, psychoanalysis continually points back to the work of interpretation in which the psychoanalyst is dealing with conscious representations. The coexistence of these two discourses gives rise to an aporia, which Ricoeur formulates in the following way: “What is the status of representation or ideas in relation to the notions of instinct, aim of instinct and affect? How can an interpretation of meaning through meaning be integrated with an economics of cathexis, withdrawal of cathexis, anticathexis?”23
            
               To solve this aporia, Ricoeur goes on to show that these two discourses in Freud's work are not actually opposed. Instead, as he puts it, “the energetics implies a hermeneutics and the hermeneutics discloses an energetics.”24

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: In a somewhat Nietzschean line of reasoning, the excess of the exaggerated falsehood, the hyperbolic lie, is the lie in/of the “truth,” which forces one into the violence of errant subjective (re)interpretation, the truth(s) in/of the lie. Hyperbole's figural expression exceeds the literal thing expressed, thereby marking the literal (in excess) as figure, and this errancy produces real, contextual change, for example, as “hyperbolic praxis” (Webb
         1993a), by dramatically moving toward a psychological and/or phenomenological transition. The errant formation reveals the instability at the center of what is attempting to be expressed. As Suzanne Guerlac (1990) suggests, hyperbole throws beyond the signified but also renders the signified a signifier, which signifies excess itself. It heightens the literal, exaggerates it, and throws beyond it in order to reveal its errancy and show its figurative nature, thereby allowing for a disruptive hermeneutical mode of thought that offers a transition from one way of perceiving the world to another.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.46.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 1998<br>
Abstract: The concept of public memory has brought with it the idea that human agency permeates the entire process of historical interpretation, representation, and appropriation. For good or ill, the emergence of memory as an analytical category has extended the right to participate in this process of representation beyond the professional historian. As Carl Becker presciently noted in a 1932 American Historical Society address, every person has become a historian. Agents contributing to the process of public memory include historical personages (e.g., George Washington, Harriet Tubman, or your suffragist great-great-grandmother), the contemporaries that produced and preserved their historical records, historians who fix and “objectify” the historical record, teachers who use historical texts in their classrooms, politicians and activists who advocate for inclusion of certain versions of history, community leaders who critique faulty historical representations, children who learn and read about individuals from long ago, and many more. Each of these agents contributes to the process of public memory creation and circulation in a different way, sometimes performing various roles simultaneously. It is clear that these many agents are related through their involvement in this process. But how, precisely, are they connected? I have suggested that the agential spiral may help us begin to answer that question.<br>

Author(s): Walsh Richard<br>
Abstract: The concept of fabula, or its many near equivalents, has always been a staple of narrative theory, yet it is vulnerable to many theoretical objections. It is possible to justify a rhetorical view of the concept's pragmatic value, and so its particular relevance to fiction, but only once various flawed notions of fabula have been eliminated. Some of these relate back quite directly to its Russian Formalist roots, but others have arisen through Structuralist mediations of the concept (in the guise of such pairs as “story” and “discourse”). The inadequacies of these models are manifest in fabula's relationship to event, chronology, temporality, causality, perspective, medium, and the genesis of narrative. The concept remains valuable, however, in respect of its role in interpretation, especially in the case of fictional narrative. The rhetorical basis of this view of fabula and its relation to sujet effectively overturns the logical hierarchy of previous representational models.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge UP<br>
Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I attempt to bring together the post-structuralist, Levinas-oriented and the rhetorical-and-narratological branches of the contemporary ethical reflection on fiction and explore their respective understanding of the notion of an “implied author.” I argue that Booth's concept and its subsequent redefinitions remain fraught with ‘technical’ difficulties and prove indefensible. After reviewing discussions of the “implied author,” I compare two readings of Yann Martel's
         Life of Pito explore the relevance of the notion for the cases when one wishes to arbitrate between contrasting interpretations of the same text. I then argue that neither the rhetorical and narratological nor the Levinas-oriented ethical criticism has succeeded in rendering Booth's concept a precise and effective tool for literary interpretation. I conclude my analysis by considering the possibility that an alternative understanding of intentionality will enable practitioners of both lines of inquiry to pursue their research without needing to resort to the concept of an implied author.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: I am not the first to give a rhetorical reading to Mannheim. Paul Ricoeur, in
         Lectures on Ideology and Utopia, also offers a reinterpretation of Mannheim's concept that makes it seem part of rhetorical theory. For Ricoeur, the function of utopia is criticism of systems of authority rather than change itself. Ideology, then, would function to legitimize systems of authority, and utopia would function to challenge systems of authority. At its best, utopia could offer possibilities for the future, but at its worst it would be the unrealizable vision, merely an escape from reality into illusion or fantasy.
               Ricoeur adds a dimension that is particularly attractive to the rhetorician: the screen of symbolic reality rather than only what is materially real and unmediated. This addition would seem to confirm that Ricoeur sees utopia as a type of rhetoric. In particular, his concept of utopia is relevant to the interpretive function of rhetorical theory. The critic cannot exist outside of historical progress (which involves ideology), but to engage in criticism at all one must presume what is utopian—the viewpoint of what is ideal for humankind.22
            
               Mannheim also makes clear in23
            Ideology and Utopiathat utopia can only be seen as an interpretation of historical events. This is because he sees knowledge as partial and dependent on the social location of the observer—a condition that his idea of utopia shares with contemporary understandings of the rhetorical situation (the social and temporal locations of the rhetor and the audience).<br>

Abstract: Louis Althusser once invoked “a new philosophy, one which was no longer an
         interpretation, but rather atransformationof the world.”
               Yet Joyce at times reminds us that texts are merely representational and interpretational—they are not literally or fundamentally transformative; they do not in the end build brave new worlds, try though they may. As Roland Barthes would suggest, dominant meanings are privileged in the generation of such connotative semantic structures as literatures and cultures: this process for the most part represents an act of ideological reinforcement, one contained within Orwell's hegemonic whale. At its most radical, therefore, literature may from this perspective advance a work of subversion or deconstruction rather than one of intentional revolutionary construction—the synthesis of a satirical Laputa rather than of a realizable Utopia.138<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>
