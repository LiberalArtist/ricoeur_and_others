  Abstract: The emergence of Coyote as trickster-saint of the ʺnew American poetryʺ—a primary event of ethnopoesis—is documented and discussed in the preceding piece by Cary Snyder. Three examples follow: from Acoma poet Simon Ortiz (see above, p. 399), who came at it from childhood, and from Mohawk poet Peter Blue Cloud and Texas-born poet Lewis MacAdams, who came at it in wanderings through the U.S.A. and through related adventures in poetry, etc. (But see also Diane di Primaʹs intuition of a female Loba (wolf) figure [below, p. 441], which is certainly related to the rest; or, at a still<br>

  The Book in Hand, Again from:

  Abstract: This book, fittingly, concludes with “the book.” The voice immediately preceding belongs to Levinas, excerpted from “Signification and Sense” (also translated as “Meaning and Sense”). In the first section of this rather difficult essay from 1964, Levinas wants to think through receptivity as the means by which he have access to meaning, and also the role of metaphor (as that which “carries something away”) in describing, but therefore also seeming to falsify or “overload” the date empirically given to our senses. Aslant Husserlian theories of intuition, and other intellectualist models of consciousness from Plato through Hume to the logical positivists,<br>

  Author(s) O’Donohue John<br>
  Abstract: The essay that best encapsulates the recent thought of Jean-Luc Marion is, in my opinion, “The Saturated Phenomenon” (SP). Here the author gives an account of what he calls the paradox of an “impossible” phenomenon, one that bedazzles the ego through an excess of intuition over intention. Although this idea has generated a good deal of fairly robust criticism,¹ most of the essay’s readers are nevertheless impressed by the way in which Marion uses it not only to enlarge upon the project of

  Book Title: Crediting God: Sovereignty and Religion in the Age of Global Capitalism-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vatter Miguel<br>
  Abstract: Tocqueville suggested that the people reign in the American political world like God over the universe.This intuition anticipates the crisis in the secularization paradigm that has brought theology back as a fundamental part of sociological and political analysis. It has become more difficult to believe that humanity's progress necessarily leads to atheism, or that it is possible to translate all that is good about religion into reasonable terms acceptable in principle by all, believers as well as nonbelievers. And yet, the spread of Enlightenment values, of an independent public sphere, and of alternative projects of modernitycontinues unabated and is by no means the antithesis of the renewed vigor of religious beliefs.The essays in this book shed interdisciplinary and multicultural light on a hypothesis that helps to account for such an unexpected convergence of enlightenment and religion in our times: Religion has reentered the public sphere because it puts into question the relation between God and the concept of political sovereignty.In the first part, Religion and Polity-Building,new perspectives are brought to bear on the tension-ridden connection between theophany and state-building from the perspective of world religions. Globalized, neo-liberal capitalism has been another crucial factor in loosening the bond between God and the state, as the essays in the second part, The End of the Saeculum and Global Capitalism,show.The essays in the third part, Questioning Sovereignty: Law and Justice,are dedicated to a critique of the premises of political theology, starting from the possibility of a prior, perhaps deeper relation between democracy and theocracy. The book concludes with three innovative essays dedicated to examining Tocqueville in order to think the Religion of Democracybeyond the idea of civil religion.<br>

  Abstract: Some years ago the well-known Lutheran theologian, Jaroslav Pelikan, stated that ‘the doctrine of the church became, as it had never quite been before, the bearer of the whole of the Christian message for the twentieth century, as well as the recapitulation of the entire doctrinal tradition from preceding centuries’.² Pelikan was pointing to the emergence of ecclesiology as the principle of coherence for the central themes of Christianity. Was this a sign of the failure of Christianity—a retreat into its religious ‘enclave’³—at least in the West? Or was it indicative of an intuition about community and sociality,<br>

  Abstract: This paper emerges from a combination of three factors: intuition, commonsense logic, and everyday observation. The intuition is simply a storyteller’s conviction, after working with the text of 1–2 Samuel for a while, that no storytellers worth their salt would be able to tell some of the stories the way they are in the text.¹ In exciting areas, they are too bare, too bald; they cry out for embellishment. Commonsense logic says that as well as the simple telling of a story and the skilled fashioning of a story as a work of literary art, there is also the<br>

  Abstract: For years in my seminar on embodiment I have begun by juxtaposing the work of Merleau-Ponty, Bourdieu, and Foucault, based on the intuition that the work of these three thinkers taken together established the intellectual topology of embodiment as an “indeterminate methodological field defined by perceptual experience and mode of presence and engagement in the world” (Csordas 1994: 12). Writing against the grain of the occasional antipathy toward phenomenology articu lated by both Bourdieu and Foucault, I suggest that taken together their work helps to outline the structure of this methodological field for cultural phenomenology by defining complementary aspects of<br>

  Author(s) EBENRECK SARA<br>
  Abstract: Good philosophies have typically been constructed by authors “with at least one eye out for the human condition,” and part of the human condition is a sense of alienation and tension between “that intuition of ourselves as one with the whole . . . and that [of ourselves] as separate beings. . . .”¹ According to the philosopher David Cooper, it is out of this latent tension that good philosophy arises and the failure to resolve it is not only an intellectual debacle, it is also a human tragedy.<br>

  Abstract: Although often overlooked, a passage from Marx’s

In this work, a theoretical perspective is opened, which I define as the “contingency of antagonism” – an Adornian concept. I will argue: (a) that this is an original perspective, irreducible to any previous philosophical positions, (b) that Marx’s intuition finds a more sophisticated reformulation in Adorno, and (c) that the idea of a contingent antagonism can provide a key to overcome the apparently antinomical outcome of negative dialectic.

  Abstract: Many decades after the fall of Hitler’s and Mussolini’s regimes a generally agreed theoretical account of fascism – or just a definition – has remained elusive. There is not even consensus about whether fascism is a strictly limited historical term, something that happened to Italians (or rather was perpetrated by Italians) between 1922 and 1945, or a universal phenomenon. The disputes surrounding fascism are not just a result of academic nitpicking; they point to what appear to be characteristics of the thing itself. At least rhetorically, fascism was opposed to ‘reason’; it glorified will, intuition and sentiment. One could feel<br>

As phenomenologists, we need to follow the higher levels of theoretical thinking, but need to attend to its beginning in originary experience. Theory cannot possibly eliminate the sense found in originary intuition, which prescribes the norm by which all subsequent theory must<br>

DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

In different ways for different poets and critics, unreason is whatever necessitates and permits the unreasonable aggression of poetic argument. It is the special means by which, in Octavio Paz’s phrase, poetry liberates thought; or it is the contradictory ability of thought to think the unthinkable and say the unsayable; or it is the fundamental life of the mind prior to rational organization, whether understood as intuition, experience, subjectivity, or the inner self; or it is the<br>

  Abstract: In the quotation above, Eileen Munro recommends a shift in professional cultures, so expertise is valued and organisational learning flourishes. We share these aspirations, but attempting to achieve them in the current context of child and family social work is likely to produce some vexing challenges. ‘Expertise’ is hydra headed, and each of its heads – research, evidence, intuition, practice wisdom – is two-faced. All are malleable and may be used both to open up and to delimit debate. Claims to expertise are often politicised and readily conscripted into moral missions. A learning culture should foster a rigorous scepticism about grand claims.<br>

This would be true even for words such as “I,” which means that the meaningfulness of my own utterances requires my own absence or death.

This a priori, which is not Kantian and does not fall under simple formal logic,¹ is the law of self-reference, which makes possible judgments about the consistency of a system or a certain type of proposition and thereby enables the creation, from itself, of a<br>

  Abstract: Die Behauptung, in der Moderne könne es keine authentischen Tragödien mehr geben, verdankt sich zum einem Teil der Blindheit gegenüber dem Medium des Films. Hier floriert das Genre, und nicht bloß in depravierter Form. Zu einem anderen Teil jedoch liegt ihr eine zutreffende Intuition zugrunde. “Die Mehrzahl der Stücke, die wir als tragische Meisterwerke betrachten, sind nur Familiendebatten und -streitereien,” schreibt Jean Giraudoux.¹ Wie aber könnte die kleine Welt der Familie noch beanspruchen, die tragenden gesellschaftlichen Konflikte einer globalen, hochkomplexen Welt mit offenen und sich permanent verschiebenen Rändern darzustellen?

Abstract: Insights from psychology and cognitive studies support the intuition that group styles are patterned and that participants can recognize those patterns. First, some studies show that what Erving Goffman (
         1959) famously called “the presentation of self” varies depending on the context (Mischel1969; Mischel and Shoda1995). Knowing how someone acted at lunch on Monday will not necessarily tell you how the person will act in a meeting on Monday, but it may help you predict how the person will act at lunch on Tuesday. Similarly, as Jean Lave (1988) shows, a person who cannot do a math problem abstractly on paper can easily solve the very same math problem concretely while grocery shopping; in these cases, people cannot even think the same thoughts in all contexts. We do not argue that no stable, core self exists:4we claim simply that to understand how groups work, we need to know how the same people might define and experience themselves in different contexts or settings—“lunchtime,” “doing math,” “grocery shopping”—and not simply assume that these self‐understandings are always the same. Research also suggests there are some limits to the number of settings people can recognize as needing different styles; people tend to fit new experiences into a finite number of familiar categories or “schemata” (see, e.g., D’Andrade1995; Kahneman and Tversky1973; Cicourel1973; see also DiMaggio and Powell1991; for a deft review of this large literature, see Howard [1994]).5Schemata categorize and distinguish between different types of people, organizations, things, or contexts.<br>

Abstract: Man’s incomprehensibility to himself thus designates a privilege, one by which man, or rather the one who alone (taking up Leibniz’s formulation) is able to say
         ego, arrives at recognizing, precisely by never himself knowing what, or rather whom, it is that he resembles, who it is who preserves his identity and can name him—none other than the One who created him. I cannot define myself, but, like every human being (and it is precisely in this that we recognize a human being), no one can know me and tell of me except, eventually, the one who creates me. God alone knows and preserves within his own secret the secret of man. Thus my unknowing of myself—otherwise called the impossibility of my gaining access to myself through any idea, concept, or image whatsoever that I may produce, except through the image that another gives to me—in no way signifies a flaw or defect in my knowledge, as metaphysics has so often claimed. Take, for example, after Malebranche,35Baruch Spinoza’s belief that he can hold that “mens se ipsam non cognoscit, nisi quatenus corporis affectionum ideas percipit” (“the mind does not know itself except insofar as it perceives ideas of affections of the body”).36This is a problematic thesis in every respect, if only because it implies that by knowing the ideas of what affects its body, the mind would thus know itself as this very body and, because this body is affected by every other body, the idea that themenswould have of itself would thus coincide with that of the complete extended world. In this way we would instead have to confirm that what man would know of himself would precisely not be himself, but anything other than himself. Similarly, when Kant underscores that the transcendentalIhas of itself only a “gänzlich leere Vorstellung” (“completely empty representation”) and thus that it has “no experience” of itself and that “the transcendental object is equally unknown [gleich unbekannt] in respect to inner and to outer intuition,” wh~<br>

Abstract: Bacon did not possess a concept of information in our sense, but he did connect the art of transmission with writing, an intuition that makes sense from the perspective of information theory. Writing is now widely understood as an information technology, indeed the most ancient.
         9Defining writing in these terms, however, is complicated by the manifest diversity of its functions. The writing we call literary, for example, has a complex and perhaps ultimately indeterminate relation to fact, information, and knowledge—thefictionalrelation—while other writing, scholarly or scientific, aspires to the condition of knowledge, something more than information. This epistemic polarity is a determining condition of our modernity, even as it seems to rest on surprisingly arbitrary distinctions between genres of writing. I am of course not the first to point this out, but neither is it my interest here to join the chorus of those who would like to dismantle these epistemic categories by exposing the instability of the genres of writing, either by positing the inherent literariness of science writing or the recoverable information content of literary works. On the contrary, my aim is to make visible a peculiar distortion in the foundational epistemic order of modernity, expressed in the very positioning of literature and science at opposite poles of an epistemic axis. Viewing all genres of writing through the lens of this epistemic opposition throws out of focus the great mass of writing that is neither scientific nor literary but existsprimarilyto transmit information.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Bourgeois contends that there are two ways of getting the relation between the enterprise of critique and its grounding in reason wrong. Neither understands the distinction between limit and boundary adequately, and, consequently, both produce untenable philosophical positions, in Bourgeois’s view. The first way, exemplified by Heidegger, attempts to derive the limit from below in finite human subjectivity (or Dasein). Heidegger, fatefully neglecting the essential idea of boundary according to Bourgeois, argues, in
      Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics(1929), that the origin of Kant’s two sources of cognition, sensibility and the understanding, resides in the creative intuition of the productive imagination. Going beyond Kant, Heidegger locates the genesis of the pure concepts or categories of the understanding in the imagination. In fact, in Heidegger’s account, the transcendental imagination becomes nothing other than the primordial time of Dasein. Reason does not set the limits of knowledge. Rather, imagination, or Dasein, limits itself through the existential projection of the meaning of Being as determined by Dasein’s own structure of finite temporality.<br>

Abstract: We saw above how configuration is the work of the productive imagination [
         14]. This imagination is not only rule governed; Ricoeur argues that it “constitutes the generative matrix of rules” [14, p. 68]. The imagination synthesizes in a narrative way that connects understanding and intuition such that it is possible to speak of “a schematism of the narrative function” [14, p. 68]. This schematism in turn is constituted within a tradition, where tradition is understood as an interplay of innovation and sedimentation; that is, there is a history of interpretation in conflict with “interpretation now” [38]. Beyond this, Ricoeur argues that tradition in turn is referenced to paradigms encompassing form, genre, and type and that paradigms constitute the “grammar that governs composition of new works” [14, p. 69]. This narrative tradition enriches the labor of imagination in the operation of configuration. A library, when defined as a synthesis of narratives, both embodies and signifies acts of imagination. Such acts can operate at different levels; for example, they are inherent to the levels of the hierarchy of activity we see above. They are inherent in personal acts and in cultural acts. The library is an enabler of new meanings and active participant in the creation of “worlds in front of the text.” Given the above, new work could take these ideas much further in LIS and well beyond the framework that is currently offered [3].<br>

Author(s): Wall John<br>
Abstract: In order to develop a revised hermeneutical circle that can respond to the unique challenges of studying childhood, it is worth recalling that hermeneutics itself has a complex developmental history. Not coincidentally, Schleiermacher is the father of both the modern theology of childhood and modern hermeneutics. He it is, in the early nineteenth century, who moves hermeneutics beyond mere techniques for the exegesis of classic texts (especially scripture) into a general method of human social understanding. Schleiermacher adapts Kant’s critique of reason to argue for a new hermeneutics as the practice of “divining” behind human linguistic expressions the mysterious “genius” or “subjectivity” of the individual author.
         28Although the connection is not stated directly, childhood, for Schleiermacher, is a divine gift from God to the world that epitomizes this subjective hermeneutical mystery. Hermes as the messenger of the gods takes his purest and most complete form in each new baby that enters the world. Hermeneutics divines the kind of inner natural wisdom or intuition that each of us still in some way retains from childhood despite the inevitable corruptions and distortions of language and society. Likewise, childhood becomes a vital hermeneutical concern (no other major theologian has written as much on childhood as Schleiermacher) in part because it embodies the kind of sacred human inwardness that hermeneutics seeks to approach. It may not be going too far (though I cannot defend it here) to make the childist argument that Schleiermacher’s early writings on childhood deeply influence his later theology and hermeneutics.<br>

Abstract: In a move that proves Derrida even more heretical than Patočka, he shows that the concept of responsibility resists all final thematization. It is a “paradoxical concept” in that, in addition to seeking to cognitively unify what responsibility means in one intuition, it also defies such an effort insofar as “it has the structure of a type of secret—what is called, in the code of certain religious practices, mystery. The exercise of responsibility seems to leave no choice but this one, however uncomfortable it may be, of paradox, heresy, and secrecy. More serious still, it must always run the risk of conversion and apostasy: there is no responsibility without a dissident and inventive rupture with respect to tradition, authority, orthodoxy, rule, or doctrine” (
      GD,p. 27). With this we have already begun to broach Derrida’s own—radically heretical—take on responsibility.<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: This emphasis—for example, one “must act in order to receive” (N5554, fol. 11v), and God as a “prior actuality” (N4816)—brings Coleridge far closer to Marion’s analysis than to Derrida’s, insofar as prayer responds to an always already present effect, claim, gift, or call. Marion presents prayer as language directed at a requisite (
         aition, or cause) from whom beings “receive themselves … as requestants.”64This is why he later argues that Derrida’s objections hold only if naming God is seen as attempting to overcome a lack or deficiency in one’s intuition of God. Marion insists that the intuition is, by contrast, present as an excess—a saturated phenomenon—that demands a proliferation of names: father, love, beauty, holiness, and so on.65Naming, in this infinitely multiplying sense, would thus be not a determination of God but a way of guarding against the illusion that any one name of God is determinative.66Yet if prayer responds and bears witness to a certain call already made on the subject, Marion arguably renders prayer too easy. After all, it is only a minor shift from the human experience of loving to praising God as love.67<br>

Abstract: Clyde Kluckhohn’s account of Navajo witchcraft makes a different kind of statement from a different culture area and a different line of anthropological thinking. My intuition is that Kluckhohn’s book is less referenced as a classic than Evans-Pritchard’s not only because it is less appealing from a literary standpoint but because it is less accessible from the standpoint of discussing rationality, and frankly scarier from the standpoint of evil supernaturalism. Navajo witchcraft comprises “all types of malevolent activities which endeavor to control the outcome of events by supernatural techniques” (
         1944:22). Navajo witches are associated with death and incest; use powder made from human corpses and shoot mystical arrows into a victim; travel by night transformed into were-animals by clothing themselves in an animal skin; meet other witches to perform inverted versions of healing ceremonies; perpetrate sorcery through spells uttered over the victim’s clothing, a fabricated image of the victim, or bodily leavings like hair or fingernails; “pray a person into the ground” body part by body part; and perform love magic by administering hallucinogenic plants, including datura. They become witches “in order to wreak vengeance, in order to gain wealth or simply to injure wantonly—most often motivated by envy” (26), and must kill a close relative as part of their initiation. A witch who was caught could be killed.<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Bonhoeffer’s critique of religion and morality and Badiou’s approach to Greek and Jewish discourses share an underlying negative, anti-idolatrous intuition that allows Bonhoeffer to preserve the holistic and gratuitous character of faith concurring with life and that enables Badiou to speak of the content of the “resurrection truth-event” as the exclusive source of the declaration’s force. Bonhoeffer focuses on acting on the word of Jesus by the participation in Jesus’s being for others, whereas Badiou stresses the importance of declaring the event by the subjective persistence of fidelity that constitutes truth’s substance. But in both cases, faith seen as the only accurate response to Jesus’s call to discipleship (Bonhoeffer)/the event interrupting the old order (Badiou) presupposes some sort of ontological “empty space” or “void” that makes faith as such possible and results in a new type of language that breaks up with traditional religious discourses.<br>

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: « Se souvenir, avons-nous dit, c'est faire quelque
chose: c'est déclarer que l'on a vu, fait ou acquis
ceci ou cela. Et ce faire mémoire s'inscrit dans un
réseau d'exploration pratique du monde, d'initia-
tive corporelle et mentale qui font de nous des
sujets agissants. C'est alors dans un présent plus
riche que celui de l'intuition sensible que le sou-
venir revient dans un présent d'initiative» (Ricoeur

Abstract: Gaston Berger, le fondateur des Études philosophiques (1926), a joué un rôle décisif dans l'introduction intellectuelle, mais aussi matérielle et institutionnelle, de la phénoménologie de Husserl en France. À partir de documents inédits et d'une lecture, dès lors renouvelée, de la thèse sur Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, cette étude montre l'originalité de l'interprétation que donne Berger de la phénoménologie husserlienne, ainsi que les réserves qu'il formule à l'égard de certains thèmes: le moi absolu, la tension entre l'intention et l'intuition, sans oublier la réappropriation de la réduction phénoménologique sous le mode d'un détachement. En ce sens, il apparaît, d'une part, que Berger est un représentant typique de la première génération française des « disciples » de Husserl et que, d'autre part, la réception qu'il en fait est déjà révélatrice de problématiques propres à certains phénoménologues contemporains. Gaston Berger, the founder of Études philosophiques (1926), played a decisive role in the intellectual and also material and institutional introduction of Husserl's phenomenology into France. Based on unpublished documents permitting a new reading of his thesis Le cogito dans la philosophie de Husserl, this study shows the originality of Berger's interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology, as well as the reservations he developed with regard to certain themes: the absolute ego, the tension between intention and intuition, not to mention the reappropriation of the phenomenological reduction by means of a detachment. In this sense, it appears, on the one hand, that Berger is a typical representative of the first French generation of « disciples » of Husserl and, on the other hand, that the reception he offered is itself revealing as to the problematics of certain contemporary phenomenologists.<br>

Abstract: On part ici de l'hypothèse que Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines de Jacques Derrida est en quelque sorte l'illustration de La Voix et le phénomène et donc la critique, par Derrida, de la phénoménologie de l'intuition, de la perception et de la vue. On relève toutefois aussi des rencontres avec Husserl et Kant. On n'oublie pas non plus qu'il y va de l'art, des arts visuels et, dans la grande richesse thématique de cet ouvrage, on relève des moments forts, aussi bien que des moments faibles, au sujet des arts du « visible ». La question demeurant : Derrida « voit »-il le dessin, la peinture et, même, entend-il la musique? The starting point of this paper is the hypothesis that Mémoires d'aveugle. L'autoportrait et autres ruines is somehow the illustration of Speech and Phenomenon, and constitutes consequently Derrida's critique of the phenomenology of intuition, perception and vision. It is however also possible to put the emphasis on some crossingpoints with Husserl and Kant. What should not be forgotten is the fact that what is at stake here is art, i.e. visual arts, and that in the great thematic richness of this work, it is possible to bring to light strong and weak points concerning the arts of the « visible ». But the question remains : can Derrida « see » the design, the painting, and even can he hear the music?<br>

Abstract: In 1925 Heidegger stated that categorical intuition was one of the three major discoveries of Husserlian phenomenology. He also claimed that categorical intuition should be interpreted in a temporal way in order to open up a path for promising research on categories. Even though Heidegger never explicitly developed this temporal interpretation of categorical intuition, this essay shows how he did this implicitly. The first part locates his first approach to this problem in the concept of world-time. The second part sees Heidegger's second approach in his concept of Temporalität. Finally the third part develops the thesis that after the subjectivism of the first and the formalism of the second approach, Heidegger developed a metaphysical notion of time as a basis for promising hermeneutic-phenomenological research on categories.<br>

Abstract: I begin with the hypothesis that Jacques Derrida's Memoirs of the Blind: The Self-Portrait and Other Ruins is in a way the illustration of Speech and Phenomena and therefore Derrida's critique of phenomenology, intuition, perception, and seeing. I also want to show in this regard parallels with both Husserl and Kant. I emphasize that what is at issue in Memoirs of the Blind is art, visual arts; and in the great thematic richness of this text, I note the high points as well as the low points concerning the arts of the "visible." The fundamental question is: Does Derrida "see" the drawing, the painting, and indeed listen to the music?<br>

Author(s): Schiemann John W.<br>
Abstract: Rational choice theory and the critical theory of Jurgen Habermas exclude important social categories from their analyses of strategic interaction. Successful strategic action in many contexts, however, depends upon the irreducibly intersubjective categories of the lifeworld. I defend this claim by analyzing the use of focal points to solve the multiple equilibria problem in coordination games, reconstructing both the generation of the salience behind focal points as well as the strategic rationality of using them. The goal of this reconstruction is to demonstrate the compatibility of what appears to be mutually hostile research traditions, validating the intuition that together they provide a better understanding of politics than either school can on its own.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Issue: i276939<br>
Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Donald Edward L.<br>
Abstract: In this issue, the California Law Review presents an exchange of views on the problem of evaluation and legal thought. Professor Rubin's Article opens the discussion by suggesting that the absence of an evaluative theory has had unfortunate consequences for the development of legal scholarship. Professor Rubin contends the lack of agreed-upon criteria for considering scholarship has stunted debate over substantive issues and encouraged the use of unexamined intuition as a basis for judgment. In formulating an evaluative theory to resolve this deficiency, Professor Rubin applies the epistemological approach of several modern continental philosophers-Habermas, Gadamer, Heidegger, and Husserl. The Article recommends that scholarship be judged using the criteria of clarity, persuasiveness, significance, and applicability. Professor Rubin also suggests that evaluators consider the doubt and anxiety they feel when confronting a work from a subdiscipline that is different from their own. The Article is followed by Professor Schlag's response.<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Abstract: O propósito do artigo é determinar a situação do pensamento de Dilthey no contexto da hermenêutica. Objetiva primordialmente, assim, determinar se a hermenêutica diltheyana seria filosófica ou se ainda se enquadraria na qualificação de clássica (=tradicional). Secundariamente, o trabalho ainda intenta caracterizar de modo breve a situação histórica na qual o pensamento de Dilthey se ambienta, e apresentar, por meio do projeto de fundamentação das ciências humanas, os pressupostos diltheyanos e alguns conceitos fundamentais de seu pensamento. As hipóteses a serem validadas são as seguintes: a) existe no pensamento diltheyano uma intuição filosófica; b) tal intuição filosófica se evidencia no propósito crítico, na preocupação ontognoseológica e na visada psicológica que a obra tardia do filósofo possuirá; c) em seu modo de operação, a hermenêutica de Dilthey ainda é metódica e, portanto, clássica (não-filosófica). The aim of the essay is to determine the status of Dilthey's thought in the context of hermeneutics. It aims to to determine, first, whether the hermeneutics by Dilthey would be philosophical or if it would still be classical (=traditional). The work also seeks to characterize the historical situation in which Dilthey's thoughts settles, and to present, through the project of foundation of human sciences, his assumptions and some fundamental concepts of his thought. The hypotheses to be validated are the following: a) there is a philosophical intuition in Dilthey's thought; b) the content of the philosophical thought of Dilthey shows itself in his critical purpose, in his ontognoseological concern and in the psychological perspective in the late work of the philosopher, c) in their mode of operation, the hermeneutics of Dilthey is still methodic and therefore classical (non-philosophical).<br>

Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: La critique phénoménologique de la métaphysique a opposé « l'intuition » à la « représentation », et le débat philosophique contemporain une phénoménologie « minimaliste » à une phénoménologie « maximaliste ». Face à ces alternatives, l'approfondissement weilien de l'expérience n'oppose ni la présence et l'absence, ni le fini et l'absolu, mais cherche à éprouver et penser le lien qui les unit, à partir de la structure trinitaire du don de l'être. À distance d'une médiation extériorisante comme d'une immanence pure, le processus de révélation n'est jamais négateur du mystère, mais en manifeste au contraire la profondeur. Ainsi, depuis la perception jusqu'à l'amour surnaturel, « évidence » et « mystère » vont toujours de pair, ce qui permet de ne rejeter aucun des niveaux de l'être et de l'expérience. The phenomenological critique of metaphysics opposed intuition and representation as contemporary debates in philosophy opposed minimalist and maximalist phenomenologies. Confronted with these alternatives the Weilean thought of experience neither opposes presence and absence, nor finite and absolute, but it tries to verify and think what unites them - based on the Trinitarian structure of the giving of being. Standing apart from exteriorizing mediation as from pure immanence, the revelation process never makes ineffective the mystery but expresses its depth. Thus, from perception to supernatural love, 'obviousness' and 'mystery' go together, which allows not to reject any levels of being and experience.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de son œuvre, Henri Bergson s'est penché sur le temps du vécu qu'il nomme «durée», une notion qu'il a, des années durant, cherché à cerner. Du point de vue de l'énonciation de sa pensée surgit une difficulté: comment mettre des mots sur une notion qui a pour caractéristique d'échapper aux schèmes de penser habituels, de se soustraire aux filets du logos ? Si, comme il le souligne, «[l] a pensée demeure incommensurable avec le langage», il se doit d'ouvrir une nouvelle voie pour formuler malgré tout sa pensée en faisant appel à des ressources langagières proprement inhabituelles, voire étrangères à la philosophie. Pour dire le temps, le philosophe se doit de briser les cadres de la pensée conceptuelle. Ainsi, l'emploi de la métaphore, habituellement ressource du langage poétique, devient sous la plume du philosophe français un outil privilégié du philosopher, transcendant les concepts pour atteindre qu'il nomme l'intuition de la durée immanente à chacun de nous. In all his writings, Henri Bergson sought to define worked the notion of time lived, which he called duration. In the enunciation of his thought, emerges a difficulty: how to put words to a notion which characteristically escapes habitual schemas of thought and logical traps? If, as he claims, «thought remains immeasurable by language», we need, nevertheless, a new way to formulate his thought by calling upon unusual or even un-philosophical linguistic resources. In order to speak of time, the philosopher must expand the framework of conceptual thought. Thus, the use of metaphor, normally a poetical resource, becomes in the writing of the French philosopher an excellent tool for philosophy, going beyond the concepts in order to reach what he calls the immanent intuition of duration which each one of us has.<br>

Abstract: This article elucidates the personalized, life-centered funeral by analyzing the development of specialized funeral functionaries and their construction of celebratory post-mortem rituals in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on participant observation and ethnographic interviews, this essay argues that secular celebrants accentuate the significance of individuality and narrative identity, but also link components of the life-centered funeral to memorialization and mourner identity. Celebrants emphasized a need to re-discover ritual in contemporary society and grounded this rediscovery in a late-modern context that not only amalgamated authenticity, intuition, and emotional empression, but incorporated central elements of Pakeha (non-Maori) New Zealand indentity.<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: Animés d'ambitions philosophiques opposées et armés de moyens conceptuels fort différents, Thomas d'Aquin et Martin Heidegger, selon une interprétation courante, n'en seraient pas moins parvenus à une même intuition fondamentale : celle de la différence ontologique, et de son caractère central en métaphysique, l'Aquinate n'étant par conséquent pas coupable d'avoir confondu l'être et l'étant, ainsi que le reproche lui en avait été fait par le philosophe allemand. On veut ici montrer à partir d'une analyse de textes heideggeriens appartenant essentiellement à la période 1930-1950 ainsi qu'un échantillon représentatif de textes thomistes que l'ontologie de l'Aquinate dont il apparaîtrait que Heidegger ne l'aurait pas comprise dans sa spécificité et son originalité, n'en appartient pas moins à l'histoire de la métaphysique telle que caractérisée par Heidegger et telle qu'il invite à la dépasser. According to a common interpretation, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Heidegger, though moved by opposing philosophical ambitions and having very different conceptual tools, arrived nonetheless at the same fundamental intuition: that of ontological difference, and of its importance in metaphysics. Aquinas is therefore not guilty of confusing esse with ens, for which the German philosopher had reproached him. By analyzing Heideggerian texts dating essentially from the years 1930-1950, together with a representative sampling of Thomist texts, the A. would like to show that Aquinas's ontology of which Heidegger had apparently not understood the specificity nor the originality, belongs just the same to the history of Metaphysics as characterized by Heidegger and such as he would have us go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: This theory of the legitimacy of the intuition or prima facie sense of our own unique individuality is supported by Brentano's ontological position on the I as substance and substance itself as the principle of individuation. In this matter of the individuation of the I-substance there is thus a serious tension. On the one hand, the preferred consideration for Brentano is that something is individuated properly through its ultimate distinguishing determination or feature, the infima species. On the other hand, Brentano is convinced that what distinguishes all our acts ultimately is that they are acts of this substance, this I. Here the third-personal thing-ontology and first-personal phenomenological ontology seem inextricably bound up with one another.<br>

Abstract: To the phenomenon that is most often characterized by a defect of intuition [ordinary objects of vision in which we intend more than we can see and Kant's rational ideas, for which no adequate experience can be given] … why would there not correspond the possibility of a phenomenon in which intuition would give
               more, indeed unmeasurably more, than intention ever would have intended or foreseen [e.g., Kant's aesthetic idea]? … [B]ut it is no longer a matter of the nonadequation of the (lacking) intuition that leaves a (given [metaphysical]) concept empty; it is a matter, conversely, of a failure of the (lacking) concept that leaves the (overabundantly given) intuition blind.

Article Title: Is a Hermeneutic Phenomenology Wide Enough? A Ricoeurian Reply to Janicaud's<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.28.3.issue-3<br>
Date: 7 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Davidson Scott<br>
Abstract: This suggestion about the vital role of interpretation in phenomenology, as Ricoeur notes, is not foreign to Husserl's own work, either. For Husserl himself employs a method of explication (
         Auslegung) of what is given to intuition in order to elucidate its deeper or hidden meanings.
               This indicates that hermeneutics is not simply a separate entity that is grafted onto phenomenology and takes up where phenomenology leaves off; instead it is already operative within the phenomenological constitution of meaning. Moreover, their connection is pushed even further when Ricoeur goes on to show later in the same essay that phenomenology, in turn, remains the “unsurpassable presupposition of hermeneutics.”16

Journal Title: Shaw<br>
Article Title: Bernard Shaw and Paul Ricoeur<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: shaw.34.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 10 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Einsohn Howard Ira<br>
Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46
