  Book Title: Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy-The Living Art of Michael C. Leff<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Henry David<br>
  Abstract: What distinguishes the study of rhetoric from other pursuits in the liberal arts? From what realms of human existence and expression, of human history, does such study draw its defining character? What, in the end, should be the purposes of rhetorical inquiry? And amid so many competing accounts of discourse, power, and judgment in the contemporary world, how might scholars achieve these purposes through the attitudes and strategies that animate their work?
      Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy: The Living Art of Michael C. Leffoffers answers to these questions by introducing the central insights of one of the most innovative and prolific rhetoricians of the twentieth century, Michael C. Leff. This volume charts Leff 's decades-long development as a scholar, revealing both the variety of topics and the approach that marked his oeuvre, as well as his long-standing critique of the disciplinary assumptions of classical, Hellenistic, renaissance, modern, and postmodern rhetoric.Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy includes a synoptic introduction to the evolution of Leff 's thought from his time as a graduate student in the late 1960s to his death in 2010, as well as specific commentary on twenty-four of his most illuminating essays and lectures.<br>

  Abstract: All men may be anxious; but it is commonly observed that some are more anxious than others, both individually and in groups. It is widely believed, for example, that our own age is a time of peculiar anxiety.¹ But though this impression may derive less from the considered views of professional historians than from the general distress of the later twentieth century, it is obviously a historical judgment; it implies that various moments in the past can be contrasted in terms of the degree of anxiety they exhibit.<br>

  Abstract: In his epics Milton attempts to portray decisive identity. By “decisive identity” I mean a conscious guiding of individuation wherein identity and character are created through moral decisions. Decisive identity does not imply creating what we initially are. Rather, it involves consciously deciding what we become, which requires a troublesome but indispensable element, freedom. Milton develops themes, character, and plot by showing the origins and consequences of identity-forming decisions. These decisions are the foci of moral judgment and meaning. In

  Book Title: Structures of Appearing: Allegory and the Work of Literature-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Machosky Brenda<br>
  Abstract: Taking a phenomenological approach to allegory, Structures of Appearing seeks to revise the history of aesthetics, identifying it as an ideology that has long subjugated art to philosophical criteria of judgment. Rather than being a mere signifying device, allegory is the structure by which something appears that cannot otherwise appear. It thus supports the appearance and necessary experience of philosophical ideas that are otherwise impossible to present or represent. Allegory is as central to philosophy as it is to literature. Following suggestions by Walter Benjamin, Machosky argues that allegory itself must appear allegorically and thus cannot be forced into a logos-centric metaphysical system. She builds on the work of Maurice Blanchot and Emmanuel Levinas to argue that the allegorical image is not a likeness to anything, not a subjective reflection, but an absolute otherness that becomes accessible by virtue of its unique structure. Allegory thus makes possible not merely the textual work of literature but the work that literature is. Machosky develops this insight in readings of Prudentius, Dante, Spenser, Hegel, Goethe, and Kafka.<br>

  Book Title: Thinking Through the Imagination: Aesthetics in Human Cognition-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Jones Jude<br>
  Abstract: Use your imagination! The demand is as important as it is confusing. What is the imagination? What is its value? Where does it come from? And where is it going in a time when even the obscene seems overdone and passe? This book takes up these questions and argues for the centrality of imagination in human cognition. It traces the development of the imagination in Kant's critical philosophy (particularly the Critique of Aesthetic Judgment) and claims that the insights of Kantian aesthetic theory, especially concerning the nature of creativity, common sense, and genius, influenced the development of nineteenth-century American philosophy. The book identifies the central role of the imagination in the philosophy of Peirce, a role often overlooked in analytic treatments of his thought. The final chapters pursue the observation made by Kant and Peirce that imaginative genius is a type of natural gift (ingenium) and must in some way be continuous with the creative force of nature. It makes this final turn by way of contemporary studies of metaphor, embodied cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.<br>

  Abstract: During the 1880s, Peirce employed the triadic nature of thought to ground his budding cosmology. As Karl-Otto Apel suggests, it was during this time (particularly in 1885) that Peirce developed a “metaphysics of evolution.”¹ Peirce’s attempt to expose a continuous relation among the three aspects of human thought becomes a desire to unify three realms of being. He comes to reassert the necessary connection between epistemology and ontology. Just as Kant’s discussion of imagination and reflective judgment in 1792 leads him to speculate on the topics of time and purposive nature, Peirce’s examination of the triadic character of logic and<br>

  Abstract: A minimum standard of justice would seem to require that all U.S. children have equal access to U.S. educational institutions, and that any school admissions policy that would exclude a candidate on the basis of race or ethnicity is in clear violation of this principle. Such a basic standard has certainly been upheld by the judgment of the Supreme Court in lawsuits where it was contravened.

  Book Title: Muscially Sublime: Indeterminacy, Infinity, Irresolvability-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Wurth Kiene Brillenburg<br>
  Abstract: Musically Sublime rewrites musically the history and philosophy of the sublime. Music enables us to reconsider the traditional course of sublime feeling on a track from pain to pleasure. Resisting the notion that there is a single format for sublime feeling, Wurth shows how, from the mid eighteenth century onward, sublime feeling is, instead, constantly rearticulated in a complex interaction with musicality. Wurth takes as her point of departure Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment and Jean-Francois Lyotard's aesthetic writings of the 1980s and 1990s. Kant framed the sublime narratively as an epic of self-transcendence. By contrast, Lyotard sought to substitute open immanence for Kantian transcendence, yet he failed to deconstruct the Kantian epic. The book performs this deconstruction by juxtaposing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of the infinite, Sehnsucht, the divided self, and unconscious drives with contemporary readings of instrumental music. Critically assessing Edmund Burke, James Usher, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Novalis, Friedrich Holderlin, Arthur Schopenhauer, Richard Wagner, and Friedrich Nietzsche, this book re-presents the sublime as a feeling that defers resolution and hangs suspended between pain and pleasure. Musically Sublime rewrites the mathematical sublime as differance, while it redresses the dynamical sublime as trauma: unending, undetermined, unresolved. Whereas most musicological studies in this area have focused on traces of the Kantian sublime in Handel, Haydn, and Beethoven, this book calls on the nineteenth-century theorist Arthur Seidl to analyze the sublime of, rather than in, music. It does so by invoking Seidl's concept of formwidrigkeit ("form-contrariness") in juxtaposition with Romantic piano music, (post)modernist musical minimalisms, and Lyotard's postmodern sublime. It presents a sublime of matter, rather than form-performative rather than representational. In doing so, Musically Sublime shows that the binary distinction ~<br>

  Abstract: The task of foundations is not to preempt doctrines, but at the same time, sound foundations provide heuristic anticipations of doctrines, especially as these foundations emerge out of dialectical conflicts of interpretations of the history of doctrinal development. Without actually coming to the point of making a judgment, one can argue for the congruence of foundational categories with key doctrines such as Trinity, Incarnation, and Church. Many of the questions about the reasonableness of central doctrines are taken up in traditional fundamental theology, but in the form of apologetics and emphasizing credibility.

  Abstract: John 21 may seem to be a surprising point of departure for a discussion about John and the historical Jesus.¹ Historical-critical scholarship, though challenged by conservative exegesis and/or by scholars using linguistic and narrative methods (e.g., Thyen 2005), still interprets John 21 as a later addition to the Gospel (e.g., Schnelle 2007a, 523–24). The judgment that John 21 has a secondary character is evident even in the more text-centered approaches of Francis Moloney (1998b, 545–47, 562–65) and Manfred Lang (1999, 294–95 n. 918).² So why take that chapter as a point of departure for raising the<br>

  Book Title: Into the Far Country-Karl Barth and the Modern Subject<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress<br>
  Author(s): Long D. Stephen<br>
  Abstract: Into the Far Country is an investigation of Karl Barth’s response to modernity as seen through the prism of the subject under judgment. By suggesting that Barth offers a form of theological resistance to the Enlightenment’s construal of human subjectivity as “absolute," this piece offers a way of talking about the formation of human persons as the process of being kenotically laid bare before the cross and resurrection of Christ. It does so by reevaluating the relationship between Barth and modernity, making the case that Barth understands Protestantism to have become the agent of its own demise by capitulating to modernity’s insistence on the axiomatic priority of the isolated Cartesian ego. Conversations are hosted with figures including Fyodor Dostoevsky, Rowan Williams, Gillian Rose and Donald MacKinnon in the service of elucidating an account of the human person liberated from captivity to what Barth names “self-judgment," and freed for creative participation in the super-abundant source of life that is the prayerful movement from the Son to the Father in the Spirit. Therefore, an account of Barth’s theology is offered that is deeply concerned with the triune God’s revelatory presence as that which drives the community into the crucible of difficulty that is the life of kenotic dispossession.<br>

A disconcerting and yet pivotal chapter in the story of Abraham, Gen 16 has traditionally been assumed to recount a failed human attempt to build a legacy. Many clues, however, indicate that more is happening than meets the eye. Not only are the patriarch and matriarch of the people of God, the models<br>

  Author(s) Berthrong John<br>
  Abstract: In the work of Aristotle, the central question is: “How should I live? or “How should one live?” Practical questions are invested with teleological significance. The question “what ought I to do?” or “what is right for me?” is subordinate to the question “what is the good life?” Aristotle speaks of the good and happy life in this regard. He views the ethos of the individual as embedded in the
                  poliscomprising the citizen body. Practical reason assumes the role of judgment illuminating the historical life-horizon of an ethos.¹ In the turn toward an ethics of the good, practical reason<br>

  Author(s) Noble T. A.<br>
  Abstract: The attention given thus far to the context of John Wesley’s use of the servant-son metaphor has been compelled in part by the need to lay the groundwork for understanding the soteriological affirmations he expected it to convey. But it has also been compelled by the need to account for his apparent confidence that the theological repertoire of his audience was such that he could draw upon the metaphor with little or no introduction. This judgment on Wesley’s part suggests that neither the metaphor nor the primary elements of its supporting theology were original to him. Yet, it is hardly<br>

  Book Title: Citizen Subject-Foundations for Philosophical Anthropology<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Steven<br>
  Abstract: What can the universals of political philosophy offer to those who experience the living paradox of an inegalitarian construction of egalitarian citizenship? Citizen Subject is the summation of +ëtienne BalibarGÇÖs career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as GÇ£weGÇ¥ (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot)._x000D_ After the GÇ£humanist controversyGÇ¥ that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a GÇ£right to have rightsGÇ¥ (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. HeGÇöor she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual differenceGÇöfigures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding GÇ£anthropological differencesGÇ¥ that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community._x000D_ The violence of GÇ£civilGÇ¥ bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness._x000D_ Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal ~<br>

  Abstract: In French and several other languages, the notion of judgment designates both a “faculty” or “capacity” and an action that takes place within the sphere of public or private relations. It can have a general neutral signification (that of an evaluation about the adequacy of means to ends or to the quality of the ends themselves). But more often it designates, in dissymmetrical fashion, the determination of a deserved or undeserved sanction upon the action of a subject, especially when the action in question is a “crime” or a “delict.”<br>

I was able to visit it in early June, and the following records a reflection that came to me at that time on one aspect of Giotto’s achievement. I have nothing particularly novel to say about Giotto himself, but seeing some of his works up close did reinforce the common judgment on how alive they are.¹<br>

  Abstract: A few commentators have noted in passing the similarity between Xunzi’s apparent teaching that “human nature is evil” and Augustine’s notions of original sin. H. H. Dubs inaugurated this line of thought in a 1956 article, in which he argued tendentiously that “like Augustine, [Xunzi] saw that the only safe foundation for authoritarianism is the belief that human nature is fundamentally evil, for then man cannot trust his own reasoning.”¹ More recently A. C. Graham and P. J. Ivanhoe have both rejected this judgment of similarity to Augustine and have argued that a more accurate translation of Xunzi’s slogan

  Abstract: In 1789 france was 85 percent rural. Twenty-two million out of 28 million French men and women lived in the countryside, the overwhelming majority engaged in agriculture and agriculture-related work. At least one-third of them were poor or destitute. Their households and communities were trapped in inertia and were untouched by the
                  lumiéres. Illiteracy was very much the norm. Peasant traditions and attitudes were inseparable from religious beliefs and practices in which magic at once reinforced and alleviated the fear of famine and plague, as well as of the Last Judgment.

Frequently associated with this belief is a judgment that antagonism toward Israel is rooted in Arab culture and, even more, in the doctrine and historical experience of Islam.

  Abstract: The history of the southern Colorado coalfields is a complex one involving social interactions among established residents, Anglo-Americans, Hispanos, African Americans, Asians, and newly arriving immigrants from Europe and Mexico. By studying the material culture of immigrants and “in-between peoples,” we can begin to examine their experiences in America and the cultural negotiations that occurred in their lives. The negotiation of culture through the use of the objects of daily life is of interest in this study. Analysis of the use of objects in “facilitating judgment, classification, and self-expression” provides insight into the construction of an individual’s cultural identity (Beaudry,<br>

Such beliefs may be held to be so because they regulate one’s life without being the result of a process of deliberation and decision. It is a matter of adopting a certain picture of how things are.

  Abstract: Aesthetics as a philosophical discipline arose in the middle of the 18th century, when art came to be defined as an autonomous field of rules, social practices, and institutions (like museums). For that historical reason, aesthetics is not just “art theory,” as it articulates both more general and more particular issues, for instance: perception through the senses, the definition of beauty, judgment of taste, the truth content of an artwork and its relationship to (physical, psychological, economic etc.) reality, the questions of originality and newness; eventually, the definition and the very possibility of “art” itself, which becomes a serious matter<br>

  Abstract: The trial makes possible different levels of normative judgment. Some are closely connected to factual accuracy, though not in the way that the Received View suggests. Other levels of judgment recognize that the trial is a public event, and that its task is not only to do justice but to preserve the conditions for the doing of justice. Thus the key task in most trials is to identify what is most

  Abstract: Freud’s concept—whereby “man lives with his unconscious, not by it” (Meissner 2003, 214)—has vexed critics since its inception. That humans possess a vast reservoir of memories, perceptions, and forms of judgment cannot be denied. Indeed, Freud has been credited with an important role in setting the research agenda for contemporary cognitive psychology (e.g., Pribram and Gill 1976; Erdelyi 1985; Modell 2006; Westen, Weinberger, and Bradley 2007) and many aspects of cognitive science (e.g., Bilder and Lefever 1998; Smith 1999a; Wilson 2002).

That is, designations of qualitative status (good, bad, indifferent, classic, or a waste of trees) are less simple descriptions of the facts of authorial achievement than they are evocations of the expectations and criteria of judgment the reader brings to bear upon a text. These constitute what, I shall call

  Abstract: As literature and theology were pervaded by historical standards of judgment from the eighteenth century onward, the possibilities of esthetic bonding were seen to narrow. This constriction occurred because human existence itself, and with it human knowledge, came to be seen as creatures of finite historical situations that could not recur. Human actions and feelings, confined to nonrecurring situations, could not teach by example; they were inimitable; they could not be reexperienced or performed by spectators.<br>

The work of mourning is demonstrated in Gallant’s stories to be a form of “narrative thinking,” which, according to John Robinson and Linda Hawpe, “consists of creating a fit between a situation and the story schema. Establishing a fit, that is, making a story out of experience, is a heuristic process,” they continue, “one which requires skill, judgment, and experience.”¹ The reader, too,<br>

For Habermas, emotion had no part to play in this idealized political process. Instead, he applauded “the critical judgment of the public making use of its reason.” From his contemporary eighteenth-century vantage point, Bolingbroke too saw little efficacy in emotion.

  Abstract: Alessandro Ferrara instead launches an entirely different strategy for transcending the particularity of context without contradicting our pluralistic intuitions: a strategy centered on the exemplary universalism of judgment. Whereas exemplarity has long been thought to belong to the domain of aesthetics, this book explores the

After defining exemplarity and describing how something unique can possess universal significance, Ferrara addresses the force exerted by exemplarity, the nature of the judgment that discloses exemplarity, and the way in which the force of the example can bridge the difference between various contexts.<br>

  Abstract: Political traditions and philosophical conceptions differ on the extent to which they allow the force of the example, and judgment, to play a role within their framework. Only the most extreme embed the ambition to filter out any and all possible role that judgment and exemplarity might play—game theoretical approaches to political choice are of this kind, for instance—but by and large all conceptions of normativity do attribute to judgment a role at least in discerning the correct and appropriate application of independently established principles of a more general nature.

  Abstract: Adorno claimed that, after Auschwitz, the moral imperative for the twentieth century was “never again.” It was through the use of a historical understanding of his experience that he arrived at this reflective judgment of what it meant to be alive after Auschwitz. His assessment pointed to a historical rupture between our traditions and modernity itself. Instead of founding the normative basis for morality on the positive use of reason, as Kant had done before, Adorno sought to recover the negative aspect of the categorical imperative through the notion that our experience of evil is the most significant historical knowledge<br>

  Abstract: Kant expresses himself in multiple ways—this is why current proposals to renew or “reappropriate”¹ the critical project do not all move in the same direction.

  Book Title: Mourning Happiness-Narrative and the Politics of Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Soni Vivasvan<br>
  Abstract: For Soni, the classical Greek idea of happiness-epitomized by Solon's proverb "Call no man happy until he is dead"-opens the way to imagining a properly secular conception of happiness, one that respects human finitude and mortality. By analyzing the story of Solon's encounter with Croesus, Attic funeral orations, Greek tragedy, and Aristotle's ethics, Soni explains what it means to think, rather than feel, a happiness available for public judgment, rooted in narrative, unimaginable without a relationship to community, and irreducible to an emotional state. Such an ideal, Soni concludes, would allow for a radical reenvisioning of a politics that takes happiness seriously and responds to our highest aspirations rather than merely keeping our basest motivations in check.<br>

  Abstract: The Solonian judgment of happiness need not be restricted to a particular social context or sedimented into a formalized social ritual. Any such formalization of the judgment of happiness into a habitual practice, not arising from the initiative of the community but from the obligation of social custom, always risks undermining the very responsibility it seeks to instill, because it requires the performance of an action that is responsible only insofar as it is not compelled. There is no institution that escapes this aporia. Nevertheless, the existence of an institution also testifies to the social currency of particular practices. It<br>

Thus, in order to demonstrate what he could not clearly posit in terms of pure sound, Hanslick employed a theory of musical perception as a more substantive criterion of judgment, drawing on various manifestations of listening to describe the effects of musical beauty. This approach led Hanslick to examine the incompetent musical listener as thoroughly as he did the competent listener, the true disciple of the beautiful. As Nicholas Cook<br>

Abstract: Maria Pia Lara’s
      Moral Textures: Feminist Narratives in the Public Spherefocuses on the relationship between morality, identity, and narrative. In particular, Lara is concerned to amend Jürgen Habermas’s discourse ethics by showing the way in which normative discourse on issues of justice is intertwined with aesthetic forms of communication and discussions of good. In his account of communicative rationality, Habermas distinguishes normative claims to validity from aesthetic ones. While discourse over moral norms appeals to reason and looks to a universal consensus, aesthetic discussions are devoted to making intelligible a certain sensibility and judgment of the good life. Rather than anticipating a universal consensus, aesthetic claims to validity depend upon a commonality in value and identity within groups and cultures for which a given judgment or life project can make sense.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Author(s): Vidal Fernando<br>
Abstract: Successive amputations of the body have been accompanied by an increasing precision concerning the part of flesh necessary for personal identity. Initially, there was an indeterminate portion of matter, which early on adopted the form of a seminal particle. Because embryology alone was incapable of accounting for identity, the seminal particle assumed some features of the brain. Endowed with a double function, the “germ” was entirely responsible for the postmortem development of resurrected persons as psychosomatic unities. But why bother with the body? All we need for Judgment Day is an accountable and conscious personality. To the extent that the brain is responsible for it, why not limit resurrection to the brain? And why not go a step further? If only part of the brain is necessary to be a
         person,shall we need it whole to enjoy the beatific vision?126Maybe just a fraction will suffice. This fraction will have to contain the information necessary for defining the self. A computer program might therefore be enough. The resurrectedIneed be nothing other than the computer equivalent of my brain. In this way, thanks to the progress of technology, to resurrect might eventually mean to be emulated by supercomputers; thus resurrected, we shall inhabit a hereafter whose technical name is cyberspace.127But how much can “we” disembody ourselves without becoming simulacra? Are we still “us” in a state of “postorganic” immortality?128<br>

Abstract: Neal‘s account of the origin and early history of the Quakers in
      The History of the Puritanssignals another set of boundaries within the ranks of eighteenth‐century Dssent. Fox’s father is described as a “poor weaver,” which he was not. It is implied that Fox abandoned his apprenticeship to a shoemaker, though in fact he completed it. The account of Fox’s subsequent actions makes no explicit judgment against him, but in its chill distance it adopts the perspective of the powers that be. “It cannot be expected that such an unsettled People should have an uniform System of rational Principles,” Neal haughtily pronounces, and represents the early Quakers as uneducated, devoid of coherent principles, antisocial in their public behavior, and inculcating no secure set of moral values.52Neal’s concluding remarks even endorse the punitive measures of the commonwealth authorities against his fellow Dissenters. He is also icily patronizing about contemporary Quakers: “the Disturbances they gave to the publick Religion for a Course of many Years was so insufferable, that the Magistrates could not avoid punishing them as Disturbers of the Peace; though of late Years they are become a more sober and inoffensive People; and by the Wisdom of their Managers, have formed themselves into a Sort of Body politick.”53<br>

Abstract: The actions of Camus’s schoolteacher were not circumscribed or constrained by geography: they were the political decisions made from an assent or acquiescence to “dogma, compliance, and cowardice.”
         124Because Braudel, always the schoolteacher, so emphasized his brief against biographical history, critics have often claimed that the delineation of limits and constraints inThe Mediterraneandevalues politics and events and leaves the book devoid of individual freedom.125Such misrepresentations distort the history that Braudel really presented: “The dangers of a social history are clear to us all, and in particular the danger of forgetting, in contemplation of the deep currents in the lives of men, each separate man grappling with his own life and his own destiny; the danger of forgetting, perhaps even of denying, the inimitable essence of each individual.”126For Braudel, the lessons of World War II demanded remembering both the forces acting upon each individual and individual acts freely chosen.127Braudel’sMéditerranéewas a call to arms: “The catastrophes and revolutions, dramas and surprises” of his time revealed “the social reality, the fundamental reality of man … in an entirely new light,” which in turn required a new history, a problem‐oriented and global, total history.128It was a new history slow to be understood, little to be appreciated, and rarely to be practiced in the Anglo‐American world remembering a different past and fighting different battles in the 1950s and 1960s. On the question of individual freedom, however, Braudel’s history of the sixteenth‐century Mediterranean is very similar to the work of its most brilliant contemporary political analyst, Machiavelli. We might recall the wily Florentine exile’s astute judgment when we reread the last words of Braudel’s penultimate paragraph in the second edition: “I would conclude with the paradox that the true man of action is he who can measure most nearly the constraints upon him, who chooses to~<br>

Abstract: On seeking for some clue to the law underlying these current maxims, we may see shadowed forth in many of them, the importance of economizing the reader’s or hearer’s attention. To so present ideas that they may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort, is the desideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point. When we condemn writing that is wordy, or confused, or intricate—when we praise this style as easy, and that as fatiguing, we consciously or unconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment.

Abstract: So long as the number of mutually transformative interreligious encounters remains below a certain critical threshold, the tradition as a whole will remain unaffected. Such was Paul Ricoeur’s assessment (in 1967) of the relationship between Western culture and the great cultural traditions of the East (
            The Symbolism of Evil[Boston: Beacon, 1967], 22–23). Ricoeur argues that East and West have not yet effectively encountered each other in such a way that the experiences of India and China have a place in the cultural memory of the West. Such encounters as have taken place for certain individuals and groups nevertheless “have remained episodic for our culture as a whole” (23). Of course, the unevenness (from a sociological point of view) of Christianity’s encounter with other religions complicates the judgment of whether religious pluralism has begun to transform radically the Christian tradition as a whole. The conception of comparative theology presupposes, however, that such mutually transformative encounters have indeed taken place, at least for significant portions of the Christian community.<br>

Abstract: According to Tesauro, the Son of God, the “sublime” writer of his own commentary, appears to the prophet as a scribe. His writing is first and foremost a sign of judgment and salvation (he marks the foreheads of those who do penance), but also of cleansing (he throws burning coal over the city). The linen cloth covering the body of the divine scribe will later become page and written text. Tesauro writes that, as a new Caesar, the divine scribe competes with himself, since he is at once supreme warrior and supreme historian of his own deeds. But as a written text, the divine scribe finds his literary model in Moses’s Decalogue.
      38If the two tablets contained the words that God dictated to Moses, in the two figures marked on both sides of the shroud God later revealed that the body of his Only‐Begotten Son brought his law to its fullness.<br>

Abstract: Frei highlights several crucial features of Phillips’s views: first, the meaning of religious language is grounded in the way of life and practice of the believer—the language therefore takes on a meaning incommensurable with the ways that a philosopher (or a believer in a different faith tradition) would understand it. Second, because of this incommensurability, the work of philosophy can only be to clarify the distinction between different uses of language; it is only from within the terms and practices of a community that one can judge one use of language to be “better” than another, and this judgment is made solely through practice. In Frei’s view, Phillips effectively effaces the possibility of Christian self‐description that would explain why one formulation of doctrine is better than another, by “absolutizing and rigidifying the warranted, indeed essential, distinction between religious statements and statements about religion.”
         32This effaces the possibility of self‐description because the best way to understand—perhaps, really, the only way to understand—is through deeper practice. It is, in a sense, as if upon expressing incomprehension regarding the incarnation, one were told to simply pray harder. The hard and fast distinction between religious utterances and statements about religion leads, on Frei’s view, to the collapse of the distinction between second‐order and first‐order religious statements. There is no logic that could explain the statements—not even to the community itself. Theology is reduced to “parroting” traditional statements: “I wanted to raise the question whether this procedure and this conviction didn’t mean that the theologian could do no more than repeat without conceptually redescribing the words of doctrines or scriptural statements that had doctrinal overtones and aftereffects.”33Frei’s fear is not that explanations come to an end, but rather that Phillips’s radically Wittgensteinian position means that explanations never~<br>

Abstract: Thus the process of judgment entails, in the first stage, a participant self‐perspective and other perspective, in the second an observer perspective, and in the third a dual perspective exchange—one between the participant self‐perspective and other perspective and one between the participant and observer perspectives. This vividly illustrates the importance of maintaining a distinction between the two sets of paired contrasts. As noted already, the observer and participant perspectives fall in the sociospatial category of distance and proximity, while the two participant perspectives, self‐perspective and other perspective, fall under interpersonal dialogue aimed at interpersonal participation.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question ~<br>

Abstract: The most systematic exploration of this ethical reading of the image of God is found in the twelfth‐century Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides. While Maimonides shares with Thomas, as above, the effort to synthesize biblical religion with the ethics of Aristotle, he does not accept Aristotle’s separation of ethics from imitative poetics. Instead, Maimonides argues for an
         imitatio Deior imitation of God as humanity’s highest moral perfection. As he puts it, “The perfection, in which man can truly glory, is attained by him when he has acquired—as far as this is possible for man—the knowledge of God, the knowledge of His Providence, and of the manner in which it influences His creatures in their production and continued existence. Having acquired this knowledge he will then be determined always to seek loving‐kindness, judgment, and righteousness, and thus to imitate the ways of God.”20Imitation clearly does not here mean only the mimesis of the visible world (as for Aristotle). It means, in a more mythic register, acting in the likeness of a God who is prior and primordial, a God who is this visible world’s underlying invisible Creator. Both individuals and the people of God collectively may be defined in part by their primal capability for imitating their Creator’s perfect rest and goodness, for imitating what is deepest within humanity itself as God’s image rather than what is corrupted in historical actuality.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur drives his investigation with his characteristic hermeneutical analysis of both canonical and unanticipated authors. The first chapter covers the field of “Recognition as Identification” with texts of Descartes, Kant, and Marcel Proust. Knowledge theories have indeed treated “recognition as identification” under the heading of judgment: that of judging an object as “the same” through an identification process. Ricoeur traces in the
      Meditationsof Descartes the occurrences of the verb “to recognize” at moments following expression of doubts and hesitations. As is the case in the subsequent discussion of Kant, Ricoeur does not directly engage the issues here. His goal is instead to show that these canonical theories of knowledge miss an important lesson of recognition.<br>

Abstract: Foucault, however, is articulating the historical situation of what is taken to be true, especially within the context of the power that perceived truth commands and the uses to which it may be put. His is an important observation, but it does not obviate any ethical imperative aimed at seeking truth (in a weak and fallibilist sense). That ethical imperative demands that advocacy also be based in truth and that accuracy and advocacy be contingent upon the quest for truth. Further, an advocacy stance necessitates some conception of “right” and the acceptance that one particular way of looking at an issue is right (or at least closer to right than the alternatives). The stance itself includes a measure of accuracy if it is to be based in some version of truth. The choice of a position of advocacy is one of judgment, and that judgment has to have some foundation. Michael Lynch warns that “if there is no such thing as being right, wrong, or in‐between, then we can’t really disagree in opinion. We may of course still differ in all sorts of ways—in our hopes, fears, and desires. But we aren’t disagreeing over who is right and who isn’t” [
         19, p. 161]. The opinion, then, that “accuracy” is biased and not a sufficient value when placed next to advocacy is itself a claim to accuracy (in the sense of being “right”).<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: So, before turning to Derrida’s reading of Patočka, let us first remind ourselves, however briefly, of what this Platonic motif is. The notion of the care of the soul is a fundamental and elementary notion in Plato’s earliest dialogues, around which all of Socrates’s concerns are gathered. Although this theme is to be found primarily in the
      Apology,Phaedo, andAlcibiades I, it is, according to Patočka, the central issue not only of all Plato’s thought but of Greek philosophy as a whole. Let us recall that for the Greeks the soul—that is, the mover and user of the body—is the human being’s true self. As Socrates argues inAlcibiades I, “there is nothing which may be called more properly ourselves than the soul.”8For the Greek philosopher, the body is only an instrument, or a tool, for a good life. But the prerequisite for a good life is then that the soul be in command of the body. The philosopher’s first duty, or responsibility, is, therefore, to get to know himself in order to be able to look to that which is most properly himself, rather than tending to what does not expressly belong to him: money, reputation, honor, as well as anything bodily. The soul achieves not only self‐control (sophron) but also purity and transparency within itself by shunning everything corporeal. It is guided in this by the knowledge of what is and emulates the eternal, the unchangeable order of the cosmos, the Divine, or the Good. As is made clear in thePhaedo, such severing of all ties to the body culminates in the care of death, which, as this dialogue shows, is an intrinsic part of the care of the soul. By caring for death—that is, by learning how to face death easily—the soul, having freed itself from any contamination with the body, becomes able “to collect and concentrate itself by itself, trusting nothing but its own independent judgment.”9Thus, within his lifetime, the philosopher’s soul will achieve a state that resembles the one that only the gods should enjoy and will thu~<br>

Abstract: Joseph Smith, as quoted by Lorenzo Brown in “Sayings of Joseph, by Those Who Heard Him at Different Times,” Joseph Smith Jr. Papers, Church Archives, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐day Saints, Salt Lake City, UT. Brown’s statement is based on his recollection in 1880 of a conversation that occurred in 1832. For questions concerning the reliability of this account, see Matthews,
            Plainer Translation, 25–26, n. 12. Referred to in Exod. 28:30 and Lev. 8:8 as an object placed in “the breastplate of judgment,”urimandthummimare the transliterations of the Hebrew words for “light” and “perfection.” For the only major study of the subject since 1824, see Cornelis Van Dam,The Urim and Thummim: A Means of Revelation in Ancient Israel(Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1997). Van Dam (Urim and Thummim, 232) rejects the traditional view that the urim and thummim was a type of lot oracle and argues that it was a single gem, “a miraculous authenticating light,” that shone to verify divine revelation to the high priest. Joseph Smith described his apparatus as “two transparent stones set in the rim of a [silver] bow fastened to a breast plate” that came into his possession with the golden plates for the purpose of translating the Book of Mormon; seeTimes and Seasons3, no. 9 (1842): 707. See alsoEncyclopedia of Mormonism, s.v. “Urim and Thummim” (by Paul Y. Hoskisson). For a discussion of the role of divining instruments in Smith’s production of the Book of Mormon, see D. Michael Quinn,Mormonism and the Magic World View(Salt Lake City, UT: Signature Books, 1998), 169–75. Later, Smith would say that, as he became more experienced at the process of translating, he no longer needed mechanical aids; see Matthews,Plainer Translation, 25, 40.<br>

Abstract: 4.
         Philosophy brings clarity to general guiding practices and principles of an individual or group. Philosophy facilitates the exploration of, as well as alignment with, the distinctive cultures of an organization. In this sense, philosophy provides a lens through which to view workplace mission and purpose, traditions of power and authority, organizational governance (how decisions are made), and organizational form (how the process of governance is structured) [19]. It encourages and reinforces collective behaviors and value systems that are essential for successful fulfillment of collective purpose. In a personal context, philosophy not only informs concepts of ethical judgment, values, and reflection, as described above, but also facilitates personal journeys of understanding with regards to moral action, personal responsibility and accountability, and principled reasoning in relation to others and in relation to the organization as a whole.<br>

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: In modern democracies, the
         ars memoriaehave been placed in the hands of the people, dispersed across various roles, ceremonies, institutions, and commemorative practices.85Understood self‐reflexively, just‐war morality can work in such contexts to ensure that war is remembered for the right reasons or, put more accurately, that what is remembered about war is right. In that way citizens can assess war and public history with habits and norms that enable us to resist the twin perils of self‐aggrandizement and self‐deception. That is no small need given how memories of past wars shape how subsequent wars are conceived, authorized, and fought. Viewed as an exercise of ascesis, just‐war morality can discipline passions and actions that risk imposing on fellow citizens and others the ultimate sacrifice. In the process, it enables us to address Anscombe’s anxious premonition: “The death of men, the curtailment of liberty, the destruction of property, the diminution of culture, the obscuring of judgment by passion and interest, the neglect of truth and charity, the decrease in belief and in the practice of religion—all these are the normal accompaniments of a war.”86<br>

Abstract: In this revised dissertation, W. David Hall argues that Paul Ricoeur’s religious writings can offer an important context for interpreting his philosophical project—that, in fact, Ricoeur’s philosophical writings take on more of a theological tenor over time, especially if one focuses on their growing emphasis on ethics. This development, Hall argues, culminates in a creative tension between love and justice that finds its peak in a confrontation between the ideas of autonomy and theonomy. “The love command lends an imperative structure to the ideal of love that opens it to moral judgment in general and ideals of justice in particular” (2), yet without turning into something reducible to the Kantian notion of a moral categorical imperative. Rather, what is at issue is a “poetic” use of the imperative in Ricoeur’s thought.<br>

Abstract: Today it is clear that during the 1980s, amid the cacophony of small arms fire, two big guns would dominate the field:
         The Classical Hollywood Cinema, wheeled out in 1984 by Bordwell, Kristen Thompson, and Janet Staiger; and Gilles Deleuze's double‐barreled cinema books,L'Image‐MouvementandL'Image‐Temps, which boomed in 1983 and 1985 respectively and were translated into English in 1986 and 1989.44Nothing else in the 1980s was nearly as prominent as those explosive projects that reconfigured the field of battle; their aftershocks still echo across film studies today, setting off allegiances and allergies even in the era of new media. Each mowed down the excesses of both interpretation and cultural studies, yet they are anything but allies.The Classical Hollywood Cinemawould dispense with lofty theory altogether, building a historical poetics based on a notion of image processing that Bordwell would soon ground in the universals of cognitive psychology. Deleuze, on the other hand, was resolutely antihistorical. What he and Bordwell shared in the 1980s was an attention to the specific and systematic character of the medium. Both denigrate interpretation, for it takes flight from films into airy speculations that deploy humanist concepts and vocabularies available elsewhere. And cultural studies spreads horizontally away from the field of cinema like spores blown by the winds of fad or by social agendas. Bordwell, who at the end of the decade explicitly demanded a research program that dispensed with interpretation, builtThe Classical Hollywood Cinemaaround a set of films chosen not by taste and judgment but by an algorithm. This was meant to guarantee that the book's description of the Hollywood system would itself be systematic and immune to bias and fashion.<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: However, Dupré's statements about individualism, which are informed by twentieth-century critics of subjectivity such as Paul Ricoeur and Michel Foucault, overlook certain contingent factors in the formation of modern personhood. As Jerrold Seigel has recently argued, such pronouncements on the sweeping powers supposedly claimed by the Cartesian subject misrepresent its rather modest origins. While Descartes had originally sought to redraw the contours of nature along mechanistic lines, after the condemnation of Galileo he was forced to retreat from an all-encompassing demonstration of Copernicanism to the less ambitious task of establishing how the mind could arrive at even the most rudimentary knowledge.
         42Descartes evaded Dupré's conundrum precisely because the recognition of God as the guarantor of the self's clear and distinct ideas fell back on the support of a transcendent divine. It was not for humans to pass judgment on the legitimacy of the cosmos in which they find themselves, since they lacked complete access to God's rationale of creation.<br>

Abstract: As for the promise of meeting the creator on judgment day, a repeating theme in Quranic war injunctions is the contrast between heaven and earthly life. Although this earth and human life are created good—indeed, Islam denies the doctrine of original sin—the prospects of judgment day and the reward of paradise frequently are held up as the end goal, creating an imbalance of sanctity.
            65This life has less of it, at least in the battle books where, for instance, believing in God and the last day and striving in the cause of God is held up over going on pilgrimage to the sacred mosque (9:19). “Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful” (9:20).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: The decisive question remains: what is promised? What offered gift can we take as the token‐as‐promise among the wealth of signs and givens that wash through the world? Owing to his view of prophetic criticism, Tillich claimed that yesterday’s prophetic act may be in need of revision and criticism today. This means that few or no signs may be taken as offered tokens. However, it would not be the case, he thinks, that Protestantism simply would carry out a sort of semiotic iconoclasm, wringing its hands, worried that every sign in the world is always a failing. Interestingly, at the end of his essay he turns to the congregation, and there we may find some ways to construe the prophetic as sign of the cross. Tillich does not develop what he calls the protestant form of grace, a chastened form that would dissent in his view from the objectification of what he calls Catholicism. Of course, this is a severely limited judgment on Tillich’s part, since there are many vibrant accounts of the Eucharist—Catholic and Protestant—together with their practical and political significance that are deeply marked by the same engagements and imperatives that Tillich raised.
         46These senses of Eucharist still would benefit from reflection on promise, and its local form in the congregation makes better sense when it is framed by the Eucharist as site of promise, gift, exchange, and free reciprocity. Eucharist, briefly, invokes the character of promise as the offering of Jesus’s testament as well as a mutual action that is both communion as exchange between God and creation as well as in and amid creation. It would not take much to think through the Eucharist as the liturgical action and embodiment of promise, to reconsider it and its practice toward being otherwise than sovereign, as I have written here. Suffice it to note that the Eucharist is a meal of betrayal, as theVerbaalways announce: “On the night in which he was betrayed.”<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: Blanchot suggests here that there is something about Judaism that reverses that logic. Proximity to Judaism would seem to undermine the dignity that accompanies self-avowal, the confession of belonging. Does this tell us something about Blanchot or about Judaism? It is striking that in the last three sentences of the passage the language becomes impersonal. There is an absence of personal pronouns to the point of awkwardness. It is as though Blanchot has subtly shifted from speaking about himself to offering general propositions about the relation of
         anyspeaker to Judaism. A note follows. It clearly turns our attention away from Blanchot and toward Judaism. He quotes Lévinas: “Judaism is an essential modality of every human being.” Lévinas makes such a statement in various contexts. He insists that Judasim—beyond its manifestation as the historical tradition of a particular people—is in fact also universalizable. Such statements would seem to enable Blanchot to make known his proximity to it, a proximity, given the halakhic definition of Judaism, that Blanchot, as an unconverted Catholic, would not be able to claim. But Blanchot responds to Lévinas: “an essential modality but most often unrecognized, buried or worse perverted and finally recused.”5Blanchot's reply to Lévinas does not discount Judaism's universality; rather it discounts only its ability to appear as recognizable. He suggests that Judaism is universalizable only insofar as it cannot be taken up, claimed, or inhabited as an identity. Thus we begin to get a sense of Blanchot's critique, although it may not appear as a critique just yet. For, of course, Blanchot's comment that Judaism is most often unrecognized, attacked, or buried appears first and foremost as a judgment on a world that responds to the prophetic Jewish voice by suppressing it. But this explanation does not explain why the comment is a note to Blanchot's statement about Judaism's proximity and unspeakablity. For this statement s~<br>

Abstract: Whether or not the poets themselves agreed, for classical rhetoricians simile and metaphor function almost exclusively as forms of ornamentation. In the Aristotelian, Ciceronian, or Quintilian rhetorical tradition, metaphor is mere “substitution,” a way to see likeness between two distinct phenomena, a language trick, and a graceful addition to the poem.
         54According to the rhetoricians, metaphor, simile, and neologism in this tradition function primarily to increase aesthetic appeal. Despite this position, as one scholar of ancient rhetoric has highlighted, in fact, metaphor had more functions in ancient poetry. Among these we might include (a) to clarify, (b) to render sensual immediacy, and (c) to link the vehicle with unexpected associations.55Still, as Auerbach highlighted about classicalfigura, these features keep the image within a tropological function because none are associated with semantics. But a number of Dante's nonhuman creature images are different. The examples of a few that he has adapted from his Latin sources can suffice here. Dante's snake and serpent images inInferno25.69–141, derived from Lucan'sPharsaliaand Ovid'sMetamorphoses, do much more than characterize the terrain, as in Lucan.56Ovid's serpent image shares a moral valence with Dante, for the image characterizes the entanglement of passion as Hermaphroditus falls to the lure of Salmacis: “But she wrapped herself around him, as a serpent / Caught by an eagle, borne aloft, entangles / Coils around head and talons, or as ivy / Winds round great oaks, or an octopus extends / Its prey within its tentacles.”57In this instance, the melding into the other presents itself as a distortion and an aberration, as a devolution, both in Ovid and in Dante. But Dante appropriates this classical textual legacy with its moral judgment, however, to support his law ofcontrapasso, moving the imagery far beyond the two dimensions of ornamentation and moral censure. Dante's analogy between the thieves ~<br>

Author(s): Guenther Genevieve<br>
Abstract: It is utterly clear that Faustus's inner life is tortured. The longing and the sense of exile invoked by his cries (“see, see where Christ's blood streams…one drop would save my soul…ah my Christ”) are utterly palpable yet horribly answered by sharp internal pain, as if an invisible claw slashed at Faustus's heart for its very longing (“Ah, rend not my heart for naming of Christ”). And by this rending sharpness Faustus becomes all the more alienated from mercy, as if he were confronted with the hallucination of Christ's blood disappearing (“Where is it now? ’Tis gone”), or as if God himself looked down in the sternest, most unforgiving judgment (“see where God / Stretcheth out his arm, and bends his ireful brows!”). But what makes God seem entirely confounding is not merely that he seems to all too ready to squash Faustus, as if Marlowe's hero were nothing more than a scurrying, terrified bug, but also that Faustus himself finally seems horrified by damnation yet remains utterly exiled and bereft of any chance for his soul to find rest because he manifests the very same habit of mind he displayed in his opening soliloquy. He still feels that he can live only in his body, addressing the earth as if it could hide him from God by hiding his body (“Then will I headlong run into the earth: Earth gape! O no, it will not harbor me” [5.2.87]). He still feels like salvation is an annihilation worse than death, and for that very reason he cannot help but prefer either to be in endless pain in hell or to have no soul at all (“O no end is limited to damned souls! / Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul?” [5.2.104–5]). And he still thinks that his soul is flesh and that his flesh will endure forever in hell (“Now body, turn to air, / Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell / O soul, be changed into little water drops, / And fall into the ocean, ne'er to be found” [5.2.116–19]). Thus he can do nothing but call on God in a gasping panic (“My God, My God!” he cries, just before~<br>

Abstract: Although this account is promising, I see three problems or issues needing clarification in it. First, while insisting that their function is not cognitive, Larmore describes such avowals as “an exercise of practical reflection” (128). This suggests that it is by a kind of thought that someone deliberately commits herself or takes “responsibility for what she is doing” (63). It would be clearer to say that this is a process of will that sets new final ends or shores up motivation to follow intentions already formed. Luther may have performed an act of practical reflection in “expressing his resolution to pursue the path on which he had set out” (63), but the resolution in which he took his stand and set his personal policies was not itself constituted by the reflective expression of them. Larmore’s account misses what I have called the “projective motivation” function of willing that Ricoeur at least implicitly recognizes. He does such a good job of arguing that the constitutive self-relation is not a “cognitive” or knowledge-aimed relationship (131) that he does not draw key distinctions between different practical or “performative” operations of mind (134). However, perhaps the problem is simply that Larmore’s terminology reflects his aversion to any “acts of will” distinct from beliefs and desires, as we saw above. For, in arguing that the object of practical reflecting is “in no way cognitive,” he briefly distinguishes it from
      practical reasoningin which we “conclude that certain actions are obligatory, permissible, or prudent” (70). While practical reasoning is cognitive and aims at objective correctness in judgment, practical reflection instead aims at “an explicit intention to do this or that” (71)—which sounds like Aristotle’s concept ofprohairesis(usually translated as rational “choice”). Why not then recognize that such an intention-forming process normally mediates between belief-desire sets and the intentions that express them?<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Abstract: To summarize, consideration of evil is necessary if an anthropological approach to morality is to be complete and comprehensive; arraying evil along dimensions of internal/external and passive/active may provide a more systematic way for it to operate as an analytic category; and approaching morality in terms of symbolic oppositions such as those between good and evil may provide a framework for cross-cultural analysis. None of this, however, obligates us to treat morality as a cultural system in Geertz’s sense, as a coherent system of symbols that can potentially sustain an institutional order. In this respect we ought to be wary insofar as treating morality as a noun creates a semantic milieu that rhetorically moves us toward thinking of it as an entified cultural system or domain to be placed alongside religion, ideology, law, or politics. The move to pluralize the noun as “moralities” is a valuable hedge that helps guarantee pluralism across cultures and internal diversity within, keeping the issues of relativism and variation before us. However, this move does not invite us to analyze morality as a modality of being in the way we might by instead emphasizing how we use “moral” as an adjective that can precede and modify any number of terms: obligation, challenge, sensibility, emotion, crisis, failing, code, system, education, community, judgment, order, actor. In the adjectival rather than its nominal sense it may be easier to recognize that the moral can enter into—spontaneously or by conscious evocation—virtually any corner of human concern.<br>

Abstract: While Bradley’s discomfort in the theater may obstruct the interpretive work needed to comprehend those “tragic feelings,” his judgment artificially divorces the sense from the significance in the play’s world of pain. The horrifying, unbearable, excessive moments of bodily pain that Bradley cannot tolerate are the same events that stun Gloucester, Albany, and the other characters into their pessimistic perspectives of the world. The reaction to the physical pain portrayed on stage brings Bradley to the same stunned state as the characters. In particular, the blinding of Gloucester is a moment that, for Bradley, can only succeed for reading audiences. In the theater, “the mere physical horror of such a spectacle” overwhelms the “purely tragic emotions” with revulsion and shock. Reading, however, allows the “mere imagination [of] the physical horror” to be “so far deadened that it can do its duty as a stimulus to pity, and to that appalled dismay at the extremity of human cruelty which it is the essence of the tragedy to excite.”
      
            Bradley’s affective response exhibits the same effects of reason overwhelmed as other critics see in Gloucester and Caruth sees in victims of trauma. As horrible as scenes like his blinding may be, as much as we may want to keep that horror in check in our imaginations as Bradley does, these moments serve a vital purpose in bringing the audience to the same affective state as the characters with whom they empathize. To borrow the language of42
         Roman Actor, our “sinews shrink” when Gloucester is tortured, and we understand his pessimistic theology because the play has deliberately brought us along with him. To judge by Bradley’s reaction, it has tortured us in a way, too.

Abstract: Children, who are composers of meaning rather than merely handlers of art materials, proceed by strategies of generative praxis that include fictive play and autobiography and involve judgment that is critically reflective and imagination that is productive. The view of things that leads an art teacher to believe that a child is making meaningful art is one in which a child's judgment is a sign, or even a criterion of thoughtful involvement. When this reflective judgment is manifested, you see that a child is guided by an inner critic of their work, and the claim that "Michael is making art" says it all. As I interpreted the long self-sustained efforts of children composing artist books, I became most aware of the way in which children's desire to represent their stories merged with drawing and a developing schema in the same way lived experience and metaphor interchange and generate each other. This interchange is the living ground of the inner critic in children's meaningful art.<br>

Author(s): Youniss James<br>
Abstract: This paper offers a discussion of contemporary theories of moral development. At present, these theories are at odds regarding the origins of morality. One camp has proposed a cognitive basis, while the other claims that morality consists in affectivity. Both these positions are discussed, and a third alternative is proposed for their resolution, based upon the model of the subject within communicative relations, whose life involves constructing reality through social procedures with others. This model is described and contrasted with the model of the self-reflecting individual which seems to underlie most current theories. In addition, a number of studies are reviewed in order to show more clearly how this third alternative provides insight into the social basis of moral judgment. Throughout the paper, two themes remain central: (a) that rationality can be considered to result from consensual validation which is obtained through communication; and (b) that sense of community, the grounds for moral action, is not incompatible with establishing or maintaining one's own individual identity.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Dédeyan Daniel<br>
Abstract: Departing from the disconcerting tact that the only passage where Kant mentions court practice is in a chapter on art, the essay undertakes a reconstruction of Kant's esthetics. As to beauty, the judgment of taste appears as a judgment on the ability to judge, and it is universally valid not because it is true, but because it is communicable. Kant's notion of art turns out to be the autonomous discourse of taste as his notion of morality stands for autonomy of man and his notion of law for autonomy of civil society. However, Kant's esthetical experience of the sublime as appearance of what neither mind nor senses grasp breaks up harmony and autonomy and unjudges judgment. At this point, the essay uncovers an intrinsically destabilizing force of Kant's ‚reason‘, traces the consequences for the judicial judgment and gives a perspective to philosophy of law within a differentiated society.<br>

Abstract: Within the papal eneyelieals (exhortations) ranging from Leo XIII (1878) to Pope Francis (2013), concern for authority in general and for obedience and duty, in particular, is in decline. This longterm trend signals intra-ecclesial secularization at the elite level. A second negative trend supports this finding: textual indicators for Catholic uniqueness such as: Catholic, Doctrine and Pope have steadily lost prominence. Upwardly directed, the textual indicators for God, Jesus, Gospel, Spirituality and Love follow positive long-term trends. The traditional eschatological code, with its keywords sin, death, final judgment, heaven or hell, reaches only low levels of attention. Overall, there is an eschatological loss, where Heaven, due to a slower decline, wins over Hell. Christ the Inexorable Judge is retreating in favor of the loving Jesus and God as Love. The millennia-old process of civilizing God persists. Technically, the quantitative content analysis was carried out mainly with TEXTPACK.<br>

Abstract: Cf. Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative (1985), translated by Kathleen Blamey and David
Pellauer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988) 3:184-85, 310 η.3· 1 am uncertain as
to precisely what Ricoeur implies with his statement: "What is surprising is that this inter-
lacing of fiction and history in no way undercuts the project of standing-for belonging to
history, but instead helps to realize it; 0:186). Giambattista Vico's fanciful division of
universal history into four periods, associated with the tropes of metaphor, synecdoche,
metonymy, and irony (in Scienze Nuova (1744, third édition), par. 400-411), is the
apparent source of this peculiar categorial framework adopted by Kenneth Burke and
(altered) Northrop Frye. Hayden White claims these tropes are the 'transformational
system built into Foucault's conception of the succession of forms of the human sciences,
even though Foucault appears not to know that it is there.'! Cf. Hayden V. White, 'Foucault
Decoded: Notes from Underground', in History and Theory 12 (1973): 45. This judgment
may apply to Hayden White himself.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Blosser Philip<br>
Abstract: Indeed, Dooyeweerd in some contexts seems to suggest this, which would conflict
fundamentally with the implications of his belief in the resurrection of the body. Reporting
on a conversation with Dooyeweerd in Amsterdam in June, 1964, Steen says that he asked
Dooyeweerd "whether he thought that the fact that Paul speaks of faith abiding in I Cor. 13
after the judgment day, had any bearing on whether the function of faith would abide after
judgment. Dooyeweerd gave an interesting reply. First he said, 'faith turns into sight and
therefore faith passes away.' When I mentioned the fact that Paul emphasizes that faith
abides, he stressed the fact that we really know nothing about the future after the judgment.
When I then asked how it would be possible to conceive of a resurrected man without all the
functions and the law spheres holding, he seemed to reconsider his previous statement and
agree that I was laying my finger on an important point." (Steen, Structure, p. 85)<br>

this Christ, the Christ who commanded Lazarus to return from death. This faith is inviolable to
the extent that not only illness, decay, violence and betrayal have no power over it; it is
unassailable even in death and at the Last Judgment.<br>

Article Title: The New Annalistic: A Sketch of a Theory of History<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342990<br>
Date: 10 1, 1976<br>
Author(s): Nipperdey Lucian<br>
Abstract: This article argues for the establishment of a new, "annalistic" model of history and historical investigation. This implies a new concept of historical event: instead of being seen as an element within a historical narrative, the historical event is defined as the common reference point of many narratives that can be told about it. The annalistic model also implies a new concept of historical change: instead of being defined as the change of an "object" within a set of given historical parameters, historical change has to be perceived as the change of parameters related to a given historical object. A new concept of history follows from the annalistic model: instead of history being a metaphysical unity of space and time (the destiny of mankind, the positivist's world of facts), in which everything is linked to everything, it is instead the product of historical judgment carried out by those who design stories about their own past, present, and future. To the "annalist" a world is imaginable in which no history has existed, exists, or will exist. The article analyzes three aspects of the concept of historical time: it demonstrates the huge variety of temporal structures in history; it argues for the foundation of the representation of historical time in linguistic concepts; and it discusses the relationship of fictionality and reality in historical discourse. Finally, the annalistic model is compared to the traditional concept of history established by historicism in the nineteenth century.<br>

Article Title: Border Crossings: History, Fiction, and Dead Certainties<br>
Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Author(s): Flynn Maureen<br>
Abstract: In this semiotic analysis of the Spanish auto defe, we begin to understand for the first time the meaning of religious rituals that have appeared completely incomprehensible in traditional accounts. The morning processions of penitents through city streets, the formal denunciations of heretics on public scaffolds, and the final burning at the stake of unrepentant sinners are placed within the context of medieval penitential practices and eschatological beliefs. The ceremony of the auto defe unveiled in time the Judgment Day awaiting all humankind at the end of time. For this reason, the spectacle aroused the interest of spectators all over Christendom, filling them with apprehension of their own final judgment.<br>

Publisher: Northeastern Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i362399<br>
Date: 12 1, 1994<br>
Author(s): Levinas Robb A.<br>
Abstract: Over the last decade theorists have begun to examine the political implications of Emmanuel Levinas's ethical phenomenology. Looking at Levinas's work as a whole, but with special emphasis on his major works, Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being, I argue that Levinas revives a Lockean state of nature politics, although with a novel and more compatible epistemology. Levinas's liberalism manifests itself most clearly in his concern for human rights, his fear of tyranny, and his use of a Lockean temporal scheme for political judgment. Both thinkers locate the source of ethical revolt in an abstracted apolitical past that represents the authoritative history of the moral individual. Levinas's "pluralism" is a return to a moral and metaphysical brand of liberalism partly at odds with deconstruction and other radical currents in contemporary social theory.<br>

Issue: i40001434<br>

Author(s): Ogletree Thomas W.<br>
Abstract: Three approaches to bio-medical ethics are identified: one weighs the values/disvalues of the probable "total" outcome of contemplated actions (value-dominant); the second gives privileged consideration to the likely impact of actions on the "rights" of human subjects involved (obligation-dominant); the third gives pre-eminence to the discretionary judgment of moral actors for the concrete resolution of moral problems (virtue-dominant). The three approaches are clarified through a commentary on the recommendations regarding fetal experimentation of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects. The recommendations are read as virtue-dominant; the essay in contrast argues for an obligation-dominant perspective.<br>

Abstract: On essaie dans ces pages d'appliquer à la philosophie de Kant et de Dilthey certains concepts en vue d'une perspective critique de l'histoire. La distinction diltheyenne entre explication et compréhension est mise en rapport avec celle qu'opère Kant entre jugement déterminant et jugement réfléchissant. Puisque la majeure partie de la complexité historique ne peut trouver son explication dans des lois générales, on propose une compréhension réfléchissante du récit historique. Mettre en relation le jugement réfléchissant et la compréhension revient à souligner la dimension normative de l'interprétation historique. La perspective anthropologique de Kant fait également place aux jugements préréflexifs, préliminaires sur l'histoire, tandis que l'approche diltheyenne par les Geisteswissenschaften ramène à une conscience reflexive ou autoréférée qui replace l'individu en son temps et en son lieu. D'autres aspects peuvent encore conduire à notre rapport critique à l'histoire : le modèle kantien d'une orientation réfléchissante de la communauté humaine, les limites qu'ilpose à l'interprétation authentique, la conception heideggerienne de l'authenticité historique, l'analyse diltheyenne des systèmes d'influence réciproque comme cadre de l'idée d'une imputation causale singulière chez Paul Ricœur. This essay is an attempt at applying certain concepts to the philosophy of Kant and Dilthey, so as to develop a critical perspective on history. Dilthey's explanation-understanding distinction is related to Kant's distinction between determinant and reflective judgment. Since much of the complexity of history cannot be determinantly explained by general laws, a reflective understanding of the meaning of historical narrative is suggested. To relate judgment and understanding is to highlight the evaluative dimension of historical interpretation. Kant's anthropological perpective also makes room for pre-reflective, preliminary judgments about history, whereas Dilthey's human science app~<br>

Author(s): Dodier Nicolas<br>
Abstract: L'extension des prérogatives des victimes au procès pénal suscite depuis de nombreuses années de vifs débats, aussi bien en France qu'aux États-Unis. À partir de l'examen du travail doctrinal entrepris par les juristes dans ces deux pays, depuis les années 1980, l'article met en évidence le « répertoire normatif » avec lequel ceux-ci envisagent la place des victimes au procès. Ce répertoire est structuré autour d'une série d'attentes concernant tant le déroulement du procès pénal (l'objectivité du jugement, l'équité du procès, le juste dosage des souffrances) que ses finalités. L'article montre comment le débat autour des victimes contribue à retravailler ces attentes et comment se dessinent, sur la base de ce répertoire commun, les lignes de fracture et de rapprochement entre juristes. Il esquisse de nouvelles perspectives sur la façon dont ce travail doctrinal s'articule avec des politiques pénales marquées traditionnellement par l'opposition entre des positions répressives et libérales. The extension of victims' prerogatives in criminal proceedings rises many years of heated debate, both in France and the United States. By studying the doctrinal work undertaken by lawyers in both countries since the 1980s, the article highlights the "normative repertoire" with which they consider the role of victims in a trial. This repertoire is structured around a series of expectations for both the conduct of criminal proceedings (objectivity of judgment, fair trial, and reasonable amount of suffering) and its purposes. The article shows how the debate around victims helps reshape those expectations and how the lines of division and rapprochement between lawyers are drawn. It points how this doctrinal work articulates with penal policies traditionally marked by the opposition between repressive and liberal stances.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: La pensée de Gabriel Marcel se présente essentiellement comme une ontologie de la relation intersubjective. Par la relecture des textes publiés dans Les hommes contre l'humain, cette étude vise à situer les enjeux éthiques de cette pensée lorsqu'elle exerce sa clairvoyance sur le terrain de la critique des idéologies, du jugement politique et de l'évaluation des formes «désenchantées» de notre culture. The thought of Gabriel Marcel presents itself as essentially an ontology of intersubjective relations. Through the rereading of texts published in Les hommes contre l'humain, this study aims to show what is at stake ethically when these ideas are used to clarify the critique of ideologies, of political judgment, and of the evaluation of various forms of cultural "disillusionment".<br>

Abstract: La relation entre spiritualisme et philosophie réflexive peut donner lieu à deux lectures inverses : ou bien la méthode reflexive trouve son fondement dans la reconnaissance de la réalité de l'esprit, ou bien c'est la pratique réflexive qui autorise et au besoin contrôle la portée des affirmations spiritualistes. L'article se situe dans cette seconde lignée. La précession de l'être par l'être qui définit la condition de la conscience ne légitime aucune intuition de l'Absolu, mais bien une affirmation ontologique originaire. L'âme, c'est la passion d'intériorité de cette auto-affirmation manifestante. Quant à l'Esprit, troisième dimension de l'être, c'est un Advenir éthique qui n'est en acte qu'à travers le monde des êtres, dans la rencontre réflexive multilatérale des consciences. The relationship between spiritualism and philosophical reflexivity can be seen in one of two ways: either a recognition of the reality of the spirit gave rise to the reflexive concept, or the practice of reflexivity came first and widened the scope of spiritual affirmations, controlling them when necessary. The article favours the latter view. The ability of a being to form a judgment about itself, and thus create a conscience, does not justify any conclusion about an Absolute, being on the contrary one of the basic statements of ontology. The soul is the result of this active self-judgment emerging from its seclusion. As for the spirit, the third component of the being, this is an ethical by-product which only comes into play through the world of beings, in the multilateral reflexive meeting of consciences.<br>

Abstract: Le jugement de valeur est étudié par Nabert dans les Éléments pour une éthique. Il se situe à l'articulation de la compréhension de soi, de l'affirmation originaire et de la régénération. Pensé comme expression d'un acte originaire et non comme participation à l'être, il permet de lier réflexion, création et pluralité. Cette perspective métaphysique, soutenue par une philosophie réflexive de la conscience, suscite une perspective critique par rapport aux théories substantialistes (Scheler, Spaemann) ou procédurales (Habermas, Renaut) de la valeur. Si la valeur est promotion d'existence, les prédicats négatifs donnent forme à l'acte de protestation contre le mal, l'injustifiable. Jean Nabert studies the judgment of value in his Éléments pour une éthique. He himself is situated at the crossroads of the comprehension of self, original affirmation, and regeneration. Seen as the expression of an originating act and not as a participation in being, it can tie together reflexion, creation and plurality. This metaphysical perspective sustained by a reflexive philosophy of conscience invites a critical perspective in relation to substantialist (Scheler, Spaemann) or procedural (Habermas, Renaut) theories of value. If value is promotion of existence, then negative predicates give form to the act of protest against evil, the unjustifiable.<br>

Author(s): Watkins John<br>
Abstract: Milton scholarship has long regarded chaos in Paradise Lost as hostile to God and creation. This judgment identifies Milton with traditional Western attitudes toward matter and material disorder-evident as early as the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma elish. In contrast to such attitudes, modern science conceives of chaos as dynamically productive of order, and postmodern cultural studies sees chaos as a relevant principle of ironic indeterminacy. Milton anticipates the postmodern endorsement of chaos in his theology of matter and in the symbolic reflections and allegorical representations of chaos in Paradise Lost. Appreciation of chaotic disorder and of indeterminacy and disapproval of the tyrannical suppression of these qualities distinguish Milton's idiosyncratic theology, political theory, and aesthetics. Even Milton's God contains the potency of chaotic matter, a womblike virtue essential to God's creative power.<br>

Abstract: According to the arguments put forward by Perloff, Dworkin, Goldsmith, and Reed, the recontextualization of language is a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment, and therefore a sign of genius. Perloff writes, “
      According to taste: it is important to remember that the citational or appropriative text, however unoriginal its actual words and phrases, is always the product of choice—and hence of individual taste.”
            In this interpretation, the appropriation of language becomes the reassertion of individuality and authority. Goldsmith terms this “self-expression,” “emotion,” and “authorship” in24
         Uncreative Writing. Perloff argues, “If the new ‘conceptual’ poetry makes no claim to originality—at least not originality in the usual sense—this is not to say thatgeniusisn't in play. It just takes different forms.”
            The rhetoric of Perloff and Goldsmith's claims is fascinating. Viewing the recontextualization of language as a marker of “taste” or aesthetic judgment is a hoary basis for authority. Attributing the act of recontextualizing to “genius” reinforces the fetish of authenticity that reigns in late capitalist society25
         
            and is a clear manifestation of the metaphysics of origin.26
         
            By “metaphysics of origin,” I refer to the central epistemic issue that creates a theology of “the new, the creative, the true” in the West, following Françoise Meltzer's analysis in27
         Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality. Meltzer shows that the idea of literary originality functions within an economy of displacement: that is, the idea of “origin” itself is continually displaced so as “to clothe its status as invention, or myth.”
            Said has identified a similar phenomenon that he calls the “imperative connection” between the idea of a beginning and the “aboriginal human need to point to or locate a beginning.”28

Abstract: Is SPEP the city of God? This would be going too far. Not even the theological turn in French Phenomenology would make this claim. Dick Howard already threw in a troubling question: “diversification that perhaps gives more breadth than depth?” he asked. And there are plenty more troubling questions. SPEP is now a big operation. It has committees and subcommittees, multiple simultaneous sessions, blind review. All these developments are signs, perhaps inevitable ones, of its success, but all have familiar downsides: bureaucratization, diversification for its own sake, what Habermas would call
   Unübersichtlichkeit. This is what happens when outsiders become insiders, the antis become their own sort of establishment. You can't blame some of us for feeling nostalgic for our long-lost innocence, even though we all know—you don't have to be a philosopher of history to know this—that we can't go there. History has rendered a judgment, but Dick Howard said, “Historywilljudge.” That's one problem with history: It's always rendering judgments, but they are never final. You'd have to be at the end of history for that, and despite the claim of some philosophers, we aren't there yet. The slaughter bench of history looks very different today from the early 1960s, but it's still in some ways a slaughter bench. So how will the SPEP of the early twenty-first century look to the philosopher-historians of 2061—or is it 2062?<br>

Abstract: The third development that I regard as Habermas's most brilliant attempt was his foray into law and politics in the book
            Facts and Norms. I reviewed it as Habermas's most brilliant attempt, and I still stand by that judgment. Allow me to quote from the first and last sentences of my review of that work:
                  We have been debating the book since the day it came out. And it is not insignificant that the famous debate between Rawls and Habermas was anticipated in that book. Beyond that, not only does the book serve as a reconstruction of the path of critical theory, it also provides a revision of Habermas's earlier work. In this sense the discourse on law at the end ofFrom the introduction: “German culture has produced two great theoretical discourses on law represented in the work of Hegel and Weber respectively; now, with the publication of Habermas's
                  Faktizität und Geltung, it may lay claim to a third.”And from the conclusion: “The book promises to play a central role in the future debate on the role of law, not merely because of its theoretical contribution, which is monumental, but because its author has generated a new framework, a new architectonic, from which the phenomenon of law in a democratic society can be perceived. In that sense, this book which was written in the shadow of the great German discourses on law authored by Hegel and Weber will cast its own light.”

Abstract: Scott's texts, therefore, are not primarily informative. Like Lingis's texts, they are effective.
         The Time of Memoryseeks to “re-membermemory,” “to reconnect it to its own loss” (Scott1999, 21). This reconnection occurs not so muchinthe book asbetweenbook and reader. Scott's prose acts like a more or less gentle crowbar prying the lids off carefully packaged conceptual crates and barrels. As one reads and the crowbar pries, one's thoughts—often coming as involuntary memories—fly loose; they will not stay pinned down. Scott's books thus displace one's skill as reader, one's educated judgment, one's mastery of canon and methodology, as in their midst one confronts how little one understands, how much one cannot recall, and how tiny a measure of even what one calls “I” is really within one's grasp. Scott's work effects the impact of the not-I that happens with the I, the meaninglessnesses along with meaning.Imight be humbled in this impact, but pushed beyond one's ego, onefeelsno humiliation, only a lightening. In reading Scott's work I am, as Foucault might say, freed of myself.<br>

Abstract: But Levinas is no Kant redivivus. Unlike Kant, he does not try to derive specific, concrete duties from these principles. They provide no aid and comfort to casuistry (in the nonpejorative sense). Especially in his analyses of the third party, he emphasizes that the move to concrete specificity involves comparison and calculation.
            
                  This takes us to the realm of risky judgment, away from the immediacy, clarity, and certainty of first principles. Already in the experience of the face to face, “the free adherence to truth, an activity of knowledge … seeks a reason which does not coincide with the radiance of this clear and distinct idea itself” (TI 303). How much further from the ideals of Platonic, Cartesian, and even Kantian intuition is the comparative, calculative wisdom of politics (for with the third-party ethics becomes politics with all its ambiguity)?7<br>

Article Title: Recovering Hyperbole:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Approaching hyperbole is a difficult task, since it is and was so often dismissed as an obvious, offensive, and simplistic trope offering little to no theoretical insights. To use one of Quintilian's examples, “As he [Antony] vomited, he filled his lap and the whole platform with gobbets of food” (2001, 8.6.68). For many, there is no more to hyperbole than this type of obvious exaggeration, which is confirmed by its contentious history. Aristotle, for example, considers hyperbole “adolescent,” describing it as an aspect of metaphor in
         On Rhetoric, and he offers a significant critique of various types of excess in theNicomachean Ethics. Demetrius regards it as being oftentimes “frigid,” that is, indecorous (1995, 427), though he does highlight its utility for expressing the impossible. Although Pseudo-Longinus favors hyperbole—he places it in the elevated style, characterizing it as a useful trope for putting a “strain on the facts” and transporting one's audience to the sublime through intensepathos—he asserts that it may easily be “ruined by overshooting the mark” (1995, 285, 281). Hyperbole was often considered bombastic, associated only with epideictic rhetoric (where it functions quite well), and was aligned with excessive stylistic vices of the sophists.
               Indeed, hyperbole was often accused of1
            cacozelia, or “perverse affectation,” which results from insincerity or poor judgment and is “the worst faults of all eloquence” (Quintilian 8.3.56).<br>

Abstract: This framework also enhances our ability to answer two other questions. First, how is it that human action both imitates the past and mobilizes it as a resource for innovation? I follow Ricoeur and others in working to open what has often been thought of as a closed hermeneutic circle. Although they labored to unpack it, thinkers as formidable as Martin Heidegger and later Hans-Georg Gadamer nevertheless expressed concern that this circle was in fact the philosophical equivalent of a death spiral (Gadamer
         1998, 190–92, 265–66, 293–94; Heidegger1996, 142–43). Ricoeur hopefully proposed that the hermeneutic circle be considered “not a vicious but a healthy circle” (1984, 1:3). Ricoeur perceived the many latent possibilities in humanity's abilities to create and deploy news stories about an old past. But his work needs to be infused with a rhetorical sensibility in order to make this a convincing view. I believe that rhetorical scholars would be well served by returning to Ricoeur to explore how the rhetorical interest in judgment and action might contribute to our understanding of this “healthy” spiral.<br>

            Beguiling a Victorian public obsessed with the pursuit of fitness, the International Health Exhibition opened in South Kensington in May 1884. Its expressed intent, to educate the public on a broad range of wellness topics, was greatly overshadowed by its dazzling display of proprietary medical commodities, salutary appliances, and faddish cures. While there were legitimate exhibits that dealt sincerely with issues of sanitation, hygiene, food, drink, and even child care, the event illuminated the extent to which personal and systemic therapeutic remedy and indeed health itself had become a lucrative industry. Less than three weeks before he joined the Fabian Society, the fledgling novelist Bernard Shaw visited one of the exhibition's prominent attractions, Francis Galton's Anthropometric Laboratory, to be quantified and measured. Chart 3655, created on 16 August 1884, contains the following collected data:His essential healthy-mindedness and peculiar buoyancy never allowed him to sink into [the fin de siècle writers'] bogs of glorified decay, [and] the very mention of his name seems to clear the poisoned air a little.

Abstract: Second, like Ricoeur, Shaw posits the poetic imagination, as it reveals itself in religious and other kinds of narrative texts, as the capability best suited for mending the ailing soul and resurrecting the frangible will. The human heart may be deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, as the prophet laments, but for Shaw (and Ricoeur) it is corrigible. Things can and do change; this is the first law of Shavian evolution. And, in Shaw's judgment, there is no more effective catalyst for provoking restorative transformation, for ridding the world of the ignorance that fuels evil, than the making of imaginative art that is aesthetically pleasing. Why is this the case? Because storytelling can break the infernal spell that enthralls the will. Telling stories, Shaw maintains, can deliver the imbecilic will from slavery, thereby restoring enlightened individual autonomy and the untrammeled capacity to act in accordance with higher rather than lower passions.
      
               “Fine art,” he muses, as exemplified for example in his own dramatic works, by implication, “is the only teacher except torture.”50
            
               In this regard, Shaw is very much like the “artist” and “Bohemian” Jesus he commemorates: the sage and commiserative guide who, “when reproached for resorting to the art of fiction when teaching in parables,” justified “himself on the ground that art is the only way in which the people can be taught.”51
            
               Consider the biblical Testaments, once more. Shaw believes they are unreliable historical documents yet nonetheless finds “in their readable parts”—that is, in their tales, fables, and legends—a treasure trove of tropes vital to the species' wellness (the same is true for Ricoeur).52
            
               However, and this is critical, he cautions that “you cannot read the Bible if you have no sense of literary art.”53

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: The story here is not of an ideal apostle converting multitudes through his divine persuasive gift but, rather, an ideal rhetorical critic with the practical and moral judgment of God himself, who suggests that emotionally driven rhetorical techniques would fail to steer an audience to higher truths. The implication is that if only the apostle spoke and people listened to the word of God through him, their very human nature would be altered. This would occur not by transient emotions, or even through mere rational persuasion like that of the Serpent in the tree, but by infusion with the Truth or the Ideal itself. The ideal preacher offers a return to a golden age before the Fall.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Setting aside for a moment the tendency of relativism (or extreme subjectivity) to enervate leaps toward the possible-impossible (of Henri Lefebvre's Utopia in the positive), in contemporary social and political thought (identified by David Harvey as leading—by way of its uncertainty—to a nonproductive “both/and” cul-de-sac),
         Utopiaanddystopiareally cannot be interchangeable, as their aims are diametrically opposed. Even when the sense thatdystopiais the opposite ofUtopiapersists in definitions of the two terms, common usage tends to muddy the affair. In common parlance, the move is from difference to a conception of dystopia as “inverted Utopia” and from there to a kind of interchangeability between them: “a strand of utopianism or dystopianism,” as one writer put it, suggesting their indivisibility.
               Conjoining the two terms establishes a “both/and” condition and at best promises only confusion or at worst presupposes failure. If the first drains Utopia of its oppositional (or critical) dimension, the second asserts that Utopia is always already dystopia, no matter how initially attractive its proposition. In contrast, it would be more productive to maintain the “either/or” divide (arrived at dialectically) argued for by Harvey in19
            Spaces of Hope(2000). Only by making a deliberate decision between alternatives, that is, only when one option is cut off, can life be promised to the other. It is no wonder, then, that the verbto decidecarries within its very meaning a sense of necessary certainty, and judgment as well.<br>
