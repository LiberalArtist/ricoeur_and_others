  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) MCARTHUR JO-ANNE<br>
  Abstract: The question of whether or not humans mourn animals is present in all of my photographic work. This theme emerged in my art when I began looking closely at dead animals and making images of roadkill animals, photographing flower and stone memorials I built around their bodies. My recent project, “Another Death,” portrays museum taxidermic animals that have suffered another kind of death after their initial demise. Frozen in time, they are presented either in the throes of death at another creature’s hand or in a limp resting pose, having just passed. Moments like these appear frequently in natural history<br>

  Abstract: I need to begin on two rather different notes—conventionally but sincerely with some words of gratitude and then somewhat unconventionally (and perhaps a bit less sincerely) with an apology. First, I want to express thanks to Tony Blair and his colleagues for their invitation to visit here and their kind hospitality over the past several days. It is real pleasure to meet and talk with members of the Centre for Research in Reasoning, Argumentation and Rhetoric and to make another pilgrimage to this mecca for the study of informal logic.

  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the previous chapter, we saw that for Girard the Gospels are not mythical texts, but the greatest form of demystification of mimetic victimage. In the Gospels there is no kind of confrontation with philosophy, understood as a discipline based on rational investigation. That confrontation rather takes place in the Pauline texts, where “knowledge of God” (σοφίᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ) is contrasted with “worldly knowledge” (σοφία τοῦ κόσμου) (1 Corinthians 1:20). The former is the knowledge of God that was revealed first in the Old Testament and then by means of Christ; this must be the object of

Diagnosis in the kind of cases we have been talking about must first of all include assuring ourselves that the members of the couple are of good will, that is, that they wish to get out of their predicament, that they are willing to consider new ideas, and that they have decided to view the therapist as an ally rather than as an adversary or rival whose worthlessness, at best, or whose toxicity, at worst, has to be demonstrated.

  Abstract: The 1996 Israeli election reflected the stasis that characterized Israeli politics for the fifteen years following the war in Lebanon. Labor and Likud existed in a kind of symbolic balance. The pragmatic Labor approach gave the party the advantage on “peace,” while Likud’s ideology and myth gave it the advantage on “security” and commitment to Eretz Israel. In this period, the stasis was broken only once, by the election of Yitzhak Rabin, whose personal credibility and gruff style reassured many Israelis that they could have both peace and security.

Ameslan (American Sign Language) represents, literally, a poetry without sound and, for its practitioners, a poetry without access to that experience of sound as voice that weʹve so often taken as the bedrock of all poetics and all language.

  Abstract: We can gain a sharper sense of the peculiar nature of the cultural order that Sanskrit helped to create, and the kind of political order for which it was cultivated, if we consider both from an explicitly comparative perspective. There is a natural tendency, exhibited even (or especially) in social and cultural theory, to generalize familiar forms of life and experience as universal tendencies and common sense. Comparison offers an antidote to this by demonstrating the actual particularity of these apparent universalisms.

  Book Title: A Usable Past-Essays in European Cultural History<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): BOUWSMA WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: The essays assembled here represent forty years of reflection about the European cultural past by an eminent historian. The volume concentrates on the Renaissance and Reformation, while providing a lens through which to view problems of perennial interest.
      A Usable Pastis a book of unusual scope, touching on such topics as political thought and historiography, metaphysical and practical conceptions of order, the relevance of Renaissance humanism to Protestant thought, the secularization of European culture, the contributions of particular professional groups to European civilization, and the teaching of history. The essays inA Usable Pastare unified by a set of common concerns. William Bouwsma has always resisted the pretensions to science that have shaped much recent historical scholarship and made the work of historians increasingly specialized and inaccessible to lay readers. Following Friedrich Nietzsche, he argues that since history is a kind of public utility, historical research should contribute to the self-understanding of society.<br>

  Abstract: Recent emphasis, stemming primarily from the work of P. O. Kristeller, on the central importance of rhetoric for Renaissance humanism, has enabled us to understand the underlying unity of a singularly complex movement; and it has proved singularly fruitful for Renaissance scholarship. At the same time, since this approach depends on the identification of a kind of lowest common denominator for humanism, it may also have the unintended effect of reducing our perception of its rich variety and thus of limiting our grasp of its historical significance. I should like, accordingly, to begin with Kristeller’s fundamental insight, but then to<br>

Like similar movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America during the age of decolonization, it hoped to forge an authentic and sovereign subject who was liberated from the mental habits of people under colonial domination. Therefore, above all, Nasserism was a quest for a kind of dignity that formed the inner meaning of the word

  Book Title: Fighting Words-Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Renard John<br>
  Abstract: One of the critical issues in interreligious relations today is the connection, both actual and perceived, between sacred sources and the justification of violent acts as divinely mandated.
      Fighting Wordsmakes solid text-based scholarship accessible to the general public, beginning with the premise that a balanced approach to religious pluralism in our world must build on a measured, well-informed response to the increasingly publicized and sensationalized association of terrorism and large-scale violence with religion. In his introduction, Renard provides background on the major scriptures of seven religious traditions-Jewish, Christian (including both the Old and New Testaments), Islamic, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Hindu, and Sikh. Eight chapters then explore the interpretation of select facets of these scriptures, focusing on those texts so often claimed, both historically and more recently, as inspiration and justification for every kind of violence, from individual assassination to mass murder. With its nuanced consideration of a complex topic, this book is not merely about the religious sanctioning of violence but also about diverse ways of reading sacred textual sources.<br>

  Author(s) Poiana Peter<br>
  Abstract: Georges Bataille and Maurice Blanchot's mutual interest in the Lascaux cave paintings signals their common concern to construct a discourse of origin in relation to art. Both writers consider origin in terms of the anxiety-filled questioning surrounding the ontological and historical aporias that have plagued Western thought, including those that appear under the banner of the Modern and the Postmodern. Both ask: what kind of discourse presides over the disconcerting doubling of reality performed by the first artists? For Bataille, origin is bound up with the ritual significance of eroticism and death as these underpin all forms of artistic endeavour;<br>

  Book Title: In Defense of Doctrine-Evangelicalism, Theology, and Scripture<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Putman Rhyne R.<br>
  Abstract: Questions surrounding the relationship of Scripture and doctrine are legion within the Protestant tradition. How can doctrine develop over time and maintain fidelity to the sacred text, especially for communities who cling to the Reformation principle of sola scriptura? Does not an appeal to contemporary, constructive theology belie commonly held Protestant and Evangelical convictions about the sufficiency of Scripture? Does admission and acceptance of doctrinal development result in a kind of reality-denying theological relativism? And in what way can a growing, postcanonical tradition maintain a sense of continuity with the faith of the New Testament? This study is an apologetic for the ongoing, constructive theological task in Protestant and Evangelical traditions. It suggests that doctrinal development can be explained as a hermeneutical phenomenon and that insights from hermeneutical philosophy and the philosophy of language can aid theologians in constructing explanatory theses for particular theological problems associated with the facts of doctrinal development, namely, questions related to textual authority, reality depiction, and theological identity. Joining the recent call to theological interpretation of Scripture, Putman provides a constructive model that forwards a descriptive and normative pattern for reading Scripture and theological tradition together.<br>

  Book Title: Sin Boldly!-Justifying Faith for Fragile and Broken Souls<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): MARTY MARTIN E.<br>
  Abstract: Can faith as trusting God make a difference? Absolutely—by relieving our anxiety over self-justification and the need to scapegoat others. When we discover we don't justify ourselves because God has justified us, we become free. What Sin Boldly! points to is the presence of the crucified and living Christ in the human soul, placed there by the Holy Spirit. And this becomes transformative. Sin Boldly! provides an experiential analysis of the contrast between self-justification and justification by God. Those among us with fragile souls are anxious, and we shore up our anxiety with walls of self-justification that victimize those whom we scapegoat. Those among us with broken souls have lost the very moral universe that makes any kind of justification possible, and this usually leads to anomie and suicide. We must pose the question: how can the gospel of grace provide transformation for both fragile and broken souls? After an exposition of the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, this book proposes the following answer: trusting in the God of grace relieves anxiety and provides a divine vocation that transcends our moral universe with the promise of forgiveness, renewal, and resurrection.<br>

  Book Title: Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): SLAUGHTER JOSEPH R.<br>
  Abstract: In this timely study of the historical, ideological, and formal interdependencies of the novel and human rights, Joseph Slaughter demonstrates that the twentieth-century rise of world literatureand international human rights law are related phenomena. Slaughter argues that international law shares with the modern novel a particular conception of the human individual. The Bildungsroman, the novel of coming of age, fills out this image, offering a conceptual vocabulary, a humanist social vision, and a narrative grammar for what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and early literary theorists both call the free and full development of the human personality. Revising our received understanding of the relationship between law and literature, Slaughter suggests that this narrative form has acted as a cultural surrogate for the weak executive authority of international law, naturalizing the assumptions and conditions that make human rights appear commonsensical. As a kind of novelistic correlative to human rights law, the Bildungsroman has thus been doing some of the sociocultural work of enforcement that the law cannot do for itself. This analysis of the cultural work of law and of the social work of literature challenges traditional Eurocentric histories of both international law and the dissemination of the novel. Taking his point of departure in Goethe's Wilhelm Meister, Slaughter focuses on recent postcolonial versions of the coming-of-age story to show how the promise of human rights becomes legible in narrative and how the novel and the law are complicit in contemporary projects of globalization: in colonialism, neoimperalism, humanitarianism, and the spread of multinational consumer capitalism.Slaughter raises important practical and ethical questions that we must confront in advocating for human rights and reading world literature-imperatives that, today more than ever, are intertwined.<br>

The industrialised nations must help the poorest ones.”¹ Appealing to the children’s “generosity,” “courage [gallantry],” and “sense of solidarity,” Mamadou’s teacher proceeds to recreate that world in microcosm within the classroom and to reenact the moment<br>

  Book Title: The Architecture of Concepts: The Historical Formation of Human Rights-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): de Bolla Peter<br>
  Abstract: The Architecture of Concepts proposes a radically new way of understanding the history of ideas. Taking as its example human rights, it develops a distinctive kind of conceptual analysis that enables us to see with precision how the concept of human rights was formed in the eighteenth century. The first chapter outlines an innovative account of concepts as cultural entities. The second develops an original methodology for recovering the historical formation of the concept of human rights based on data extracted from digital archives. This enables us to track the construction of conceptual architectures over time. Having established the architecture of the concept of human rights, the book then examines two key moments in its historical formation: the First Continental Congress in 1775 and the publication of Tom Paine's Rights of Man in 1792. Arguing that we have yet to fully understand or appreciate the consequences of the eighteenth-century invention of the concept "rights of man," the final chapter addresses our problematic contemporary attempts to leverage human rights as the most efficacious way of achieving universal equality<br>

  Book Title: Committing the Future to Memory: History, Experience, Trauma-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Clift Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Whereas historical determinacy conceives the past as a complex and unstable network of causalities, this book asks how history can be related to a more radical future. To pose that question, it does not reject determinacy outright but rather seeks to explore how it works. In examining what it means to be "determined" by history, it also asks what kind of openings there might be in our encounters with history for interruptions, re-readings, and re-writings. Engaging texts spanning multiple genres and several centuries from John Locke to Maurice Blanchot, from Hegel to Benjamin Clift looks at experiences of time that exceed the historical narration of experiences said to have occurred in time. She focuses on the co-existence of multiple temporalities and opens up the quintessentially modern notion of historical succession to other possibilities. The alternatives she draws out include the mediations of language and narration, temporal leaps, oscillations and blockages, and the role played by contingency in representation. She argues that such alternatives compel us to reassess the ways we understand history and identity in a traumatic, or indeed in a post-traumatic, age.<br>

In history, the figure of the hero is a cultural construct of idealized masculinity that arises within the context of a struggle over the gendered order. Since the meaning of gender is, as Judith Butler argues, always deferred as a kind of imitation for which there is no original, the maintenance of masculine values requires the relentless production of ideologies of gender to reinforce the subordination of women and the dominant<br>

  Book Title: The structure of modern cultural theory-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Osborne Thomas<br>
  Abstract: This book is about the claims of Cultural Theory as a particular kind of intellectual ethos or discipline. The book argues that Cultural Theory is best seen, at least in its ‘modern’ form, as an ethical discipline. As such, it should be seen as a form of inquiry governed by the guiding idea of the cultivation of critical autonomy and, as such, is designed as much to change what we are in our relations to ourselves as to describe the world as it is in particular ‘positive’ ways. The content of the book develops this argument through critical readings of three canonical writers, namely Theodor Adorno, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu. A final chapter contrasts the ethical idea of modern Cultural Theory developed here with its postmodern derivations, which, it is argued, have taken both a more positivist and even more moralistic form.<br>

  Abstract: Much has been made in this book of the idea of modern cultural theory being ultimately ethical in its aims and outlook. Or at least, our principles of reading in relation to Adorno, Bourdieu and Foucault have been, in effect, ethico-critical ones; emphasising that these thinkers are best read not simply in ‘positive’ or epistemic terms but as contributing to a kind of ethically minded reconfiguration of ourselves as critical beings, something that has been shorthanded in terms of the ethics of autonomy.<br>

  Abstract: A word about this paper¹ —not only its subject and approach, but also its kind—to avoid false expectations. In considering Redcross Knight and Edgar as chivalric knights, I explore Spenser’s and Shakespeare’s respective uses of materials from the tradition of chivalric romance. So I rule out source or influence study. Shakespeare knew Spenser’s version, among many versions, of the Lear story, but I neither trace the untraceable—exact and exclusive similarities between the two versions—nor appraise the authors’ use of this story. Likewise, I rule out critical judgments about their better or worse use of the materials from<br>

  Abstract: To latter-day readers and critics, the early works of any established writer undoubtedly hold a special kind of attraction. Do their first forays into fiction ‘reveal’, as Kuno Schuhmann (2001: 75) puts it, ‘a personality that may be more carefully hidden in later texts? Does the first shaping of themes throw additional light on the later novels?’ In relation to A. S. Byatt’s early work, Kathleen Coyne Kelly (1996: 14), in her monograph on the author, provides at least a partial answer to these questions when she remarks that ‘[w]hile Byatt’s art has certainly matured over the past thirty years,<br>

  Abstract: Amnesia is a kind of immobility. To obliterate connections between past and present is to preclude the possibility of movement or change in the future, to condemn oneself to the anaesthetised drudgery of the endless present. It is appropriate, then, that Jonathan Lethem so often employs spatial metaphors in his interrogations of the condition of American amnesia. In

  Abstract: The prehistoric stone circle complex at Avebury on the Wiltshire chalkland of southern England is the largest of its kind in Europe (figure 5.1). A 420-metre-diameter earthwork encloses a ring of huge standing stones, which in turn encloses two other roughly circular configurations of megaliths with further stone settings at their centres. Radiating out to the south and west are linear avenues of megaliths that snake out across 3.5 kilometres of the surrounding chalk landscape to link the Avebury structures to other prehistoric earth and stone monuments. The henge earthwork and the stone settings all belong to the third millennium<br>

Implicit in these questions is an underlying concern that there is a normative dimension to this ethical subject.

  Abstract: Reckoning with the fossil remains of unfamiliar creatures, naturalists in the eighteenth century began to historicize nature. The era’s preeminent naturalist, Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon, articulated the program for this new kind of history by conceptualizing the earth itself as an archive: “As in civil history, one consults titles, one researches medals, one deciphers antique inscriptions to determine the epochs of human revolutions and discover the dates of moral events; similarly, in natural history, one must search the archives of the world, draw old monuments from the bowels of the earth, collect their debris, and assemble in a body<br>

Although one will discover it gradually in this chapter, one already detects that the principal criterion of this ambiguity could not reside exclusively in the division between the partisans and the opponents of that thought: that would be to confuse the scope of a philosophy with the kind of influence associated with an ideology or a political party. Of course, I will have to make room for the reservations or attacks. But one has to take other disagreements into account, and<br>

While Cavell’s engagement with religion is not of a straightforwardly affirmative kind, we can’t call it straightforwardly dismissive, either. Rather, we could perhaps speak about a transformation, a “transfiguration” (to use his own vocabulary) of religion taking place in his work.<br>

  Book Title: On the Anarchy of Poetry and Philosophy-A Guide for the Unruly<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): BRUNS GERALD L.<br>
  Abstract: Marcel Duchamp once asked whether it is possible to make something that is not a work of art. This question returns over and over in modernist culture, where there are no longer any authoritative criteria for what can be identified (or excluded) as a work of art. As William Carlos Williams says, A poem can be made of anything,even newspaper clippings.At this point, art turns into philosophy, all art is now conceptual art, and the manifesto becomes the distinctive genre of modernism. This book takes seriously this transformation of art into philosophy, focusing upon the systematic interest that so many European philosophers take in modernism. Among the philosophers Gerald Bruns discusses are Theodor W. Adorno, Maurice Blanchot, Arthur Danto, Stanley Cavell, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Franois Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy, Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, and Emmanuel Levinas.As Bruns demonstrates, the difficulty of much modern and contemporary poetry can be summarized in the idea that a poem is made of words, not of any of the things that we use words to produce: meanings, concepts, propositions, narratives, or expressions of feeling. Many modernist poets have argued that in poetry language is no longer a form of mediation but a reality to be explored and experienced in its own right. But what sort of experience, philosophically, might this be? The problem of the materiality or hermetic character of poetic language inevitably leads to questions of how philosophy itself is to be written and what sort of communitydefines the work of art-or, for that matter, the work of philosophy.In this provocative study, Bruns answers that the culture of modernism is a kind of anarchist community, where the work of art is apt to be as much an event or experience-or, indeed, an alternative form of life-as a formal object. In modern writing, philosophy and poetry fold into one another. In this book, Bruns helps us to see how.<br>

  Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas’s writings are rich in comments and reflections on art, poetry, and the relations between poetry and ethical theory.¹ Of particular importance is the question of language, because there appears to be a kind of symmetry between language as an ethical relation and the language of poetry, both of which expose us to regions of subjectivity or existence on the hither (anarchic) side of cognition and being. The ethical and the poetic are evidently species of saying (
                  le Dire) in contrast to the propositional character of the said (le Dit), yet neither one is translatable into the other, and<br>

  Abstract: The word ‘atheism’ is derived from the Greek: a meaning ‘not’ is conjoined with theos meaning ‘god’. So atheism may be defined as follows: it is the belief that there is no God.

By the dawn of 2008, the world population had exceeded 6.6 billion people. Nearly a third of these identified with Christianity. Roughly 900 million were evangelicals. A century ago, Christians of any kind were much fewer in number, and the vast majority lived in Europe and North America. But the twentieth century witnessed a major explosion of evangelicalism, a blast that rocked the two-thirds world more powerfully than the West. By the early 1970s, most Christians lived outside<br>

  Abstract: In one of Shakespeare’s famous plays there is a scene in which some of Hamlet’s former schoolfellows flatter him about his breadth of mind. Hamlet’s response shows that he is well aware of the dark political subtext to this flattery, but his response also demonstrates precisely the kind of conceptual expansiveness he ironically denies. Refusing the compliment that Denmark is “too narrow for [his] mind” Hamlet says, “O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space.”¹<br>

  Abstract: The belief in the persistence of life after death is not a goal in itself. People who believe in immortality of the soul and in resurrection of the dead do not do so just to state that personal identity will endure. They do so in order to state that the personal identity will endure in a different world, in a different kind of life. The belief in life beyond death is therefore meant to affirm that there is a new world waiting for us, and that life on Earth is not the definitive, final reality.<br>

Thus it is that we speak of miraculous escapes, miraculous footballers, miraculous recoveries, miraculous skin creams and so on. For the believer, however, ‘miracle’ has a much more specific meaning. It refers to an occurrence so astounding that only God as its agent can explain it. Here a miracle stands as an external evidence of divine revelation, as<br>

  Abstract: The current economic crisis stems from a deeper crisis of cultural imagination and civilisational ethics: here is the starting point of this collection of essays which draw a new political economy facing the crisis of Western civilization. This book gathers together a range of audacious and provocative readings of Caritas in Veritate, the first papal encyclical that addresses issues immediately relevant for politic, economic, and social theory. These readings embody the kind of fruitful dialogue Pope Benedict XVI wanted to generate with his radical discourse for an alternative political economy.<br>

This chapter considers five discourses that are not conventionally consulted for input on theological hope: nihilism, lament, disability, feminist theory, and feminist theology. The philosophical and critical theory conversation of nihilism and its relative, indeterminism or undecidability, suggests a kind of hope without over-confident claims of knowable hopes for the future. Scriptural and extra-scriptural lament demonstrates a persistent and apparently futile hope that continues into and through death with no sign of God’s response or rescue.

  Abstract: Theological discourse, whether implicitly or explicitly, is in search of some kind of justification. It was because of its contamination by various intellectual heresies, old and new, that often this justificatory practice rather than letting the discourse flow beyond itself, tended to lead it into the fortress of a regulatory concept, practice or institution or a contingent or illusory foundation. But as history so often witnesses, it is precisely when discourse guards itself most securely that it must face the most formidable objection because it loses its ecstatic character, ceasing thus to reflect the overriding feature of its source.<br>

  Abstract: Based on a decade's work in Ginzburg's archives, the book discusses previously unknown manuscripts and uncovers a wealth of new information about the author's life, focusing on Ginzburg's quest for a new kind of writing adequate to her times. She writes of universal experiences-frustrated love, professional failures, remorse, aging-and explores the modern fragmentation of identity in the context of war, terror, and an oppressive state. Searching for a new concept of the self, and deeming the psychological novel (a beloved academic specialty) inadequate to express this concept, Ginzburg turned to fragmentary narratives that blur the lines between history, autobiography, and fiction.<br>

What are the reasons for this popularity, structurally and ‘socially’ speaking? Is there a certain novelistic genre or structure related to popularity? What is the social status of that kind of novel?<br>

  Abstract: As I have suggested elsewhere (Gandesha 2017), there are two models that understand the problem of reification as a kind of “forgetting”(Horkheimer, Adorno 1988, p. 230). The first stems from the Idealist tradition and, via a detour through Feuerbach’s “transformative critique” of religion, forms the basis for Marx’s analysis of the commodity form in the famous fourth section of the first chapter of

  Abstract: If the slogan ‘make love, not war’ became a constantly evoked symbol of the kind of protest generated in the ‘long sixties’ (Jameson 1984; Marwick 1998, 16–20), the fact is that the attitudes and discourses that originated in this period have not always corresponded to this pacifist image, at times understood retrospectively as parodic, individualistic and carefree.

  Abstract: The form of tragedy and the traditional mode of expressing man’s tragic condition in the theatre were, as is well known, some of Bertolt Brecht’s most controversial targets.¹ There are two sets of reasons for this. The first is technical, because classical tragedy and the drama that derives from it belong, as Brecht saw it, to a kind of theatre that does not arouse the critical spirit and the dialectical attitude. The second is philosophical, because they are founded on an idea of destiny and the immutability or universality of human thought, in conflict with Brecht’s Marxian principles.²<br>

  Abstract: Clifford Geertz (1926–2006) was one of the main figures to build a new kind of anthropology, beginning in the 1960s. In doing so, he borrowed many ideas from philosophy. Although some of his works have been read by philosophers too, the influence of his anthropology on philosophy is negligible. The reception of his thoughts does not conform to the generally accepted significance of his writings, appropriate to their philosophical content. Most often, Geertz is read only superficially and the reading is confined to his two most famous texts – ‘Thick Description’ (1973) and ‘Deep Play: Notes on Balinese Cockfight’ (1972).<br>

  Abstract: Separated by centuries, but united by their faith, and a certain kind of idiosyncratic genius, both Evagrius of Pontus and Søren Kierkegaard developed the traditional concept of “the soul” within anthropologies grounded in their dynamic metaphysics. Each posited a tripartite composition of the human being, consisting of body, mind/soul, and soul/spirit. Despite the variable terminology used by the thinkers (and their translators), both employed a “third term” to designate the relation between the person’s corporeal and incorporeal aspects: a relation that is, itself, constitutive of the character of one’s being and a litmus test for one’s moral and spiritual health.<br>

  Abstract: Love and Christian Ethicsaddresses significant authors, texts, and topics dealing with the interlaced meanings of divine love, love for God, neighbor love, and love for oneself. A recurring question is whether and how the Christian moral life amounts to a kind of eudaimonism. The book also offers insights and arguments that develop alternative accounts of the normative content of the command to love the neighbor as oneself. Beyond these concerns, the collection practically reframes an ethic of agape regarding (and this is a partial list) love’s motivational effectiveness, sexual life, the moral repair of communities, and interreligious exchange.<br>

  Abstract: Literary critics have long acknowledged that form is (a kind of) content and, as such, socially meaningful. Even scholars whose focus is hermeneutic rather than poetic cannot wholly escape attending to the formal elements that shape—and arguably

Yet the relationship between narratology and studies of the novel—to take one example—still remains something of a standoff, and nowhere more vividly than on the turf of history.

  Book Title: New Romantic Cyborgs-Romanticism, Information Technology, and the End of the Machine<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Coeckelbergh Mark<br>
  Abstract: Romanticism and technology are widely assumed to be opposed to each other. Romanticism -- understood as a reaction against rationalism and objectivity -- is perhaps the last thing users and developers of information and communication technology (ICT) think about when they engage with computer programs and electronic devices. And yet, as Mark Coeckelbergh argues in this book, this way of thinking about technology is itself shaped by romanticism and obscures a better and deeper understanding of our relationship to technology. Coeckelbergh describes the complex relationship between technology and romanticism that links nineteenth-century monsters, automata, and mesmerism with twenty-first-century technology's magic devices and romantic cyborgs.Coeckelbergh argues that current uses of ICT can be interpreted as attempting a marriage of Enlightenment rationalism and romanticism. He describes the "romantic dialectic," when this new kind of material romanticism, particularly in the form of the cyborg as romantic figure, seems to turn into its opposite. He shows that both material romanticism and the objections to it are still part of modern thinking, and part of the romantic dialectic. Reflecting on what he calls "the end of the machine," Coeckelbergh argues that to achieve a more profound critique of contemporary technologies and culture, we need to explore not only different ways of thinking but also different technologies -- and that to accomplish the former we require the latter.<br>

Skillfully blending intellectual, political, and cultural history, Jan-Werner Müller elucidates the ideas that shaped the period of ideological extremes before 1945 and the liberalization of West European politics after the Second World War. He also offers vivid portraits of famous as well as unjustly forgotten political thinkers and the movements and institutions they inspired.Müller pays particular attention to ideas advanced to justify fascism and how they relate to the special kind of liberal democracy that was created in postwar Western Europe. He also explains the impact of the 1960s and neoliberalism, ending with a critical assessment of today's self-consciously post-ideological age.<br>

Some modern scholars have performed the same surgery. More often, commentators have treated Paul’s discourse about the status of Israel in chapters 9–11 as a kind of personal excursus, interesting for insights into Paul’s problems but not of much relevance to ours.

  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

  Book Title: Becoming Human Again-The Theological Life of Gustaf Wingren<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Olson Daniel M.<br>
  Abstract: One of the most influential Swedish theologians of the twentieth century, Gustaf Wingren’s career spanned more than forty years of upheaval both in his field and around the globe. Provocative and challenging, Wingren revelled in a good argument and this attitude set the tone for much of his scholarship. A Swedish Lutheran, he made his name through his research into the theology of Martin Luther, breaking away from both traditional interpretations of Luther and the theology of his famous teachers, Karl Barth and Anders Nygren, before shifting his focus onto systematic theology. In a fresh take, Bengt Kristensson Uggla delves into the influence of Wingren’s second wife, Greta Hofsten, on the direction of his theology. Hofsten, a left-wing political activist who was searching for a new language of faith, wove Wingren’s work together with her own political philosophy to create an unusual kind of Christian socialism. Her thinking had a profound effect on Wingren, causing him to recontextualise his older work entirely. In Becoming Human Again, Uggla examines how Wingren’s combative nature often served him well as a theologian, driving him to engage with innovations in the field and re-examine his older views.<br>

Although the growing free church movement that had begun in the mid-1800s had given rise to the beginnings of religious pluralism in Sweden, it had done so within the framework of Christianity in general and Protestantism in particular.

  Book Title: The Vision of the Soul-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson James Matthew<br>
  Abstract: Ours is an age full of desires but impoverished in its understanding of where those desires lead-an age that claims mastery over the world but also claims to find the world as a whole absurd or unintelligible. In
      The Vision of the Soul, James Matthew Wilson seeks to conserve the great insights of the western tradition by giving us a new account of them responsive to modern discontents. The western- or Christian Platonist-tradition, he argues, tells us that man is an intellectual animal, born to pursue the good, to know the true, and to contemplate all things in beauty. Wilson begins by reconceiving the intellectual conservatism born of Edmund Burke's jeremiad against the French Revolution as an eff­ort to preserve the West's vision of man and the cosmos as ordered by and to beauty. After defining the achievement of that vision and its tradition, Wilson off­ers an extended study of the nature of beauty and the role of the fine arts in shaping a culture but above all in opening the human intellect to the perception of the form of reality. Through close studies of Theodor W. Adorno and Jacques Maritain, he recovers the classical vision of beauty as a revelation of truth and being. Finally, he revisits the ancient distinction between reason and story-telling, between mythos and logos, in order to rejoin the two.Story-telling is foundational to the forms of the fine arts, but it is no less foundational to human reason. Human life in turn constitutes a specific kind of form-a story form. The ancient conception of human life as a pilgrimage to beauty itself is one that we can fully embrace only if we see the essential correlation between reason and story and the essential convertibility of truth, goodness and beauty in beauty. By turns a study in fundamental ontology, aesthetics, and political philosophy, Wilson's book invites its readers to a renewal of the West's intellectual tradition.<br>

It asks whether neighbourhood planning can be said to devolve some kind of ‘power to the people’.

  Abstract: The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

On the one hand, popular novels are simply the novels read and appreciated by a very large number of readers, as opposed to those that are canonised by critics and by literary histories but actually read by a relatively small élite. On the other hand, the ‘popular’ novel conjures up – if somewhat vaguely – a particular kind of fiction, raising the question of the aesthetic and philosophical specificity of the popular: do ‘popular’ novels conform to particular models of narrative?

Objectivity, on the other hand, is a category that discloses a certain kind of historical knowledge, gained through the methodically-ruled procedures of research and that has furnished it with a solid validity jutting over the field of arbitrary meaning.<br>

  Book Title: Norms of Rhetorical Culture-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Farrell Thomas B.<br>
  Abstract: Rhetoric is widely regarded by both its detractors and advocates as a kind of antithesis to reason. In this book Thomas B. Farrell restores rhetoric as an art of practical reason and enlightened civic participation, grounding it in its classical tradition-particularly in the rhetoric of Aristotle. And, because prevailing modernist world views bear principal responsibility for the disparagement of rhetorical tradition, Farrell also offers a critique of the dominant currents of modern humanist thought.Farrell argues that rhetoric is not antithetical to reason but is a manner of posing and answering questions that is distinct from the approaches of analytic and dialectical reason. He develops this position in a number of ways: through a series of bold reinterpretations of Aristotle's
      Rhetoric; through a detailed appraisal of traditional rhetorical concepts as seen in modern texts from the Army-McCarthy hearings to Edward Kennedy's memorial for his brother, Mario Cuomo's address on abortion, Betty Friedan'sFeminine Mystique, and Vaclav Havel's inaugural address; and through a fresh appraisal of theories on the character of language and discourse found in contemporary philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, deconstructionism, Marxism, and especially in Habermas's critical theory of communicative action.<br>

As a result, it is—like the narrative level itself—a deductive taxonomy determined by the general principles of musical narrative and superimposed upon the musical domain. Narrative phases thus enable a greater degree of interpretive subtlety: with expansion of the four basic archetypes according to secondary criteria that vary by degree (instead of by kind), more precise comparisons can be made within the larger categorical frames.<br>

  Abstract: FROM WHAT WE have seen so far, Arendt’s theory of judgment sketches out a novel conception of a kind of mental activity that she holds Kant to have unwittingly discovered when he came across the judgment of taste. This kind of judgment, which lies behind the reflective judgment of taste and is not identical with it, concerns appearances. What Arendt calls appearances can be retraced to Kant’s transcendental aesthetics, in which he elaborated on the a priori forms constitutive of phenomena of nature that are to be subsequently subsumed by the determinant judgment under the discursive conditions of cognition, that<br>

Hence, something needs to be added to capture the kind of novelty involved. To pinpoint this innovation, modernity is also referred to as the “age of reason” or the age of enlightenment and science—in order to demarcate the period from a prior age presumably characterized by unreason, metaphysical speculation, and intellectual obscurantism or darkness.<br>

  Abstract: Scholarly analyses of violence, including this study, also constitute a type of mediation and a genre with its own rules, expectations, and pitfalls. Many scholars who have taken violence as their subject of study have been keenly aware that violence is an especially challenging, perhaps even distinctive subject matter (see Nordstrom and Robben 1995; Donham 2006; Lubkemann 2008). Thus Donald Donham argues in his essay “Staring at Suffering”: “violence is a different kind of representational object than market systems or kinship. . . . Violence is red. There is a kind of excess, an ambivalence of both attraction and repulsion<br>

What might a designation of “alien,” “sojourner,” or “foreigner” have meant to various audiences or readers in this context? In the second century C.E., Lucian of Samosata (or whoever the author of this epigraph may be) could offer a straightforward remark about the reproach of alien status with no need for further argument or explanation, confident that his readers would understand and agree. But what sort of reproach? Was the category of the alien a relatively neutral civic descriptor—in which case<br>

  Book Title: Detecting Texts-The Metaphysical Detective Story from Poe to Postmodernism<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Sweeney Susan Elizabeth<br>
  Abstract: Although readers of detective fiction ordinarily expect to learn the mystery's solution at the end, there is another kind of detective story-the history of which encompasses writers as diverse as Poe, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Auster, and Stephen King-that ends with a question rather than an answer. The detective not only fails to solve the crime, but also confronts insoluble mysteries of interpretation and identity. As the contributors to
      Detecting Textscontend, such stories belong to a distinct genre, the "metaphysical detective story," in which the detective hero's inability to interpret the mystery inevitably casts doubt on the reader's similar attempt to make sense of the text and the world.Detecting Textsincludes an introduction by the editors that defines the metaphysical detective story and traces its history from Poe's classic tales to today's postmodernist experiments. In addition to the editors, contributors include Stephen Bernstein, Joel Black, John T. Irwin, Jeffrey T. Nealon, and others.<br>

  Abstract: As an art working with time and addressing the ear, music, like poetry, requires and challenges memory. As early as the fourth century, Augustine used the example of music to illustrate his meditations on time and memory, describing the process of understanding a melody that unfolds in time,¹ and Edmund Husserl, in his
                  Untersuchungen zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewußtseins, used music as the most obvious example of how memory and expectation or, in his terminology, retention and protention, cooperate in the perceptive construction of a melody.² Perceiving and understanding a melody requires memory, the same kind of short-term memory which<br>

As we ask ourselves this question, it is important to also ask what kind of bioregional literary criticism particular texts can offer. How does the bioregional imagination of one writer differ from the next? How does the place-based aesthetic of one bioregion differ from the next? In this paper I’m particularly interested in considering what contribution postcolonial literatures can make to our growing understanding of bioregional literary criticism.

  Abstract: So far in my attempt to construct an affirmative genealogy of human rights I have placed great emphasis on the importance of subjective certainty, the sense of self-evidence and affective intensity of the kind characteristic of the sacred. I have portrayed the genesis and development of human rights as a history of the relocating of such self-evidence, a process that straddles the spheres of practices, values, and institutions. So experiences are an important driving force in this history—everyday experiences, but above all experiences that transcend the everyday, that fill actors with enthusiasm or affect them profoundly as their horror<br>

The dialectic nature of these links is played out daily in our movement choices and bodymind awareness. Judith Butler asks what kind of performances will destabilize received and rehearsed categories. The possibilities of transformation may be found in a “failure to repeat, a de-formity.”¹ Dance forms are repeated daily, hourly, in rehearsal rooms around the world.

  Book Title: Black Intersectionalities-A Critique for the 21st Century<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): Rocchi Jean-Paul<br>
  Abstract: Black Intersectionalities: A Critique for the 21st Century explores the complex interrelationships between race, gender, and sex as these are conceptualised within contemporary thought. Markers of identity are too often isolated and presented as definitive, then examined and theorised, a process that further naturalises their absoluteness; thus socially generated constructs become socialising categories that assume coercive power. The resulting set of oppositions isolate and delimit: male or female, black or white, straight or gay. A new kind of intervention is needed, an intervention that recognises the validity of the researcher’s own self-reflexivity. Focusing on the way identity is both constructed and constructive, the collection examines the frameworks and practices that deny transgressive possibilities. It seeks to engage in a consciousness raising exercise that documents the damaging nature of assigned social positions and either/or identity constructions. It seeks to progress beyond the socially prescribed categories of race, gender and sex, recognising the need to combine intellectualization and feeling, rationality and affectivity, abstraction and emotion, consciousness and desire. It seeks to develop new types of transdisciplinary frameworks where subjective and political spaces can be universalized while remaining particular, leaving texts open so that identity remains imagined, plural, and continuously shifting. Such an approach restores the complexity of what it means to be human.<br>

If Donne’s ‘Lecture on the Shadow’ or ‘A Nocturnall upon S.

Assuming that world-making possibly means that a society must be framed, then this frame entails rules – i.e., rules can be the frame. This call for rules answers Nancy Fraser’s call (in Chapter 10) for a frame. But the frame she suggests should be of a special kind.

Instead, it is the antisemite who constructs the notion of the "Jew" and "Semitism" in a contingent manner (Virchow 162). The standard understanding of the notion is that of "being against Jews."

  Book Title: The Subject in Crisis in Contemporary Chinese Literature-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Cai Rong<br>
  Abstract: Post-Mao China produced two parallel discourses on the human subject in the New Era (1976–1989). One was an autonomous, Enlightenment humanist self aimed at replacing the revolutionary paragon that had dominated under Mao. The other was a more problematic subject suffering from either a symbolic physical deformity or some kind of spiritual paralysis that undermines its apparent normalcy. How do we explain the stubborn presence, in the literature of the 1980s and 1990s, of this crippled agent who fails to realize the humanist autonomy envisioned by post-Mao theorists? What are the anxieties and tensions embedded in this incongruity and what do they reveal? This illuminating and original critical study of the crippled subject in post-Mao literature offers a detailed textual analysis of the work of five well-known contemporary writers: Han Shaogong, Can Xue, Yu Hua, Mo Yan, and Jia Pingwa. The author investigates not only the literary characters within the texts, but also their creators—real subjects in history, Chinese writers whose own agency was being tested and established in the search for a new subjectivity. She argues that, reenacting the Maoist legacy, the literary search failed to provide a viable model for a postrevolutionary China. In addition, the deficiency and inadequacy of the subject cannot always be contained in the Communist past—a history to be transcended in the design of modernity after Mao. The representation of the problematic subject thus punctured post-Mao optimism and foreshadowed the eventual abandonment of the move to rethink subjectivity in the 1990s. By diving beneath the euphoria of the 1980s and the confusion and frustration of the 1990s, these critical readings offer a unique perspective with which to gauge the complexity of China’s quest for modernity and a fuller understanding of the self’s multifaceted experience in the post-Mao era.<br>

  POSTMODERN DEMOCRACY IN A MODE OF INFORMATION from:

  Author(s) Dallmayr Fred<br>
  Abstract: The great integrative processes characterizing the twentieth century lead some people to forecast radical quantitative changes in the life of the world community, up to and including the emergence of a single planetary civilization with a new system of human values. Others, whose projections strike me as more probable, forecast the rise of a metacivilization that will become a kind of a cultural “common denominator,” and which, instead of absorbing or pushing aside national, regional civilizations, will rather stand above all of them. Under any scenario of future developments, it is quite evident that the expansion of contacts and cultural<br>

  Book Title: Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries-  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): MATSUMOTO STACIE<br>
  Abstract: The first three centuries of the Heian period (794–1086) saw some of its most fertile innovations and epochal achievements in Japanese literature and the arts. It was also a time of important transitions in the spheres of religion and politics, as aristocratic authority was consolidated in Kyoto, powerful court factions and religious institutions emerged, and adjustments were made in the Chinese-style system of ruler-ship. At the same time, the era’s leaders faced serious challenges from the provinces that called into question the primacy and efficiency of the governmental system and tested the social/cultural status quo. Heian Japan, Centers and Peripheries, the first book of its kind to examine the early Heian from a wide variety of multidisciplinary perspectives, offers a fresh look at these seemingly contradictory trends. Essays by fourteen leading American, European, and Japanese scholars of art history, history, literature, and religions take up core texts and iconic images, cultural achievements and social crises, and the ever-fascinating patterns and puzzles of the time. The authors tackle some of Heian Japan’s most enduring paradigms as well as hitherto unexplored problems in search of new ways of understanding the currents of change as well as the processes of institutionalization that shaped the Heian scene, defined the contours of its legacies, and make it one of the most intensely studied periods of the Japanese past.<br>

  Abstract: Niccolò Machiavelli writes: “[O]ne can say this generally of men: that they are ungrateful, fickle, pretenders and dissemblers, evaders of danger, eager for gain.”¹ To deal with this kind of human nature, he argues that a political ruler needs to know how to use force as well as laws, all according to necessity. He also advises that it is important for the ruler to appear merciful to win the hearts and minds of people, while the ruler should remain feared by people.² Such a seemingly dark assessment of human nature finds echoes in the political thought of many thinkers in<br>

For instance, Edward Casey’s comprehensive study of the philosophical history of place,The Fate of Place, gives precedence to place over space, suggesting that “to be at all—to exist in any way—is to be somewhere, and to be somewhere is to be in some kind of place” (ix). Because it is so central to our existence, place is often taken for granted and subsumed by the more dominant categories of space and time. The notion of space, Casey argues, is traditionally described as universal, infinite, and ubiquitous. Place,<br>

This is a different kind of symbol from that described by Peirce; for the American semiologist, symbol is opposed to icon and index in a trichotomy of signs. But for the aesthetic idealists, the symbol has a transcendent resonance which gives it a master-function in music and makes it a determinant of moral force and aesthetic value. In this kind of symbol, the relation of signifier and signified is asymmetric; what is signified is a radical idealism, an overcoming of the antinomy of thought and object. The imagination<br>

Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. "Some of the humor throughout," Welsh notes, "can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance." Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.<br>

  Book Title: Touching the World-Reference in Autobiography<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): EAKIN PAUL JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Paul John Eakin's earlier work Fictions in Autobiography is a key text in autobiography studies. In it he proposed that the self that finds expression in autobiography is in fundamental ways a kind of fictive construct, a fiction articulated in a fiction. In this new book Eakin turns his attention to what he sees as the defining assumption of autobiography: that the story of the self does refer to a world of biographical and historical fact. Here he shows that people write autobiography not in some private realm of the autonomous self but rather in strenuous engagement with the pressures that life in culture entails. In so demonstrating, he offers fresh readings of autobiographies by Roland Barthes, Nathalie Sarraute, William Maxwell, Henry James, Ronald Fraser, Richard Rodriguez, Henry Adams, Patricia Hampl, John Updike, James McConkey, and Lillian Hellman. In the introduction Eakin makes a case for reopening the file on reference in autobiography, and in the first chapter he establishes the complexity of the referential aesthetic of the genre, the intricate interplay of fact and fiction in such texts. In subsequent chapters he explores some of the major contexts of reference in autobiography: the biographical, the social and cultural, the historical, and finally, underlying all the rest, the somatic and temporal dimensions of the lived experience of identity. In his discussion of contemporary theories of the self, Eakin draws especially on cultural anthropology and developmental psychology.<br>

Wartime propaganda promotes this identification between the individual and society: to enlist is to enlist in history, to participate in a global movement of some kind.

  Book Title: Politics and the Imagination-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Geuss Raymond<br>
  Abstract: In politics, utopians do not have a monopoly on imagination. Even the most conservative defenses of the status quo, Raymond Geuss argues, require imaginative acts of some kind. In this collection of recent essays, including his most overtly political writing yet, Geuss explores the role of imagination in politics, particularly how imaginative constructs interact with political reality. He uses decisions about the war in Iraq to explore the peculiar ways in which politicians can be deluded and citizens can misunderstand their leaders. He also examines critically what he sees as one of the most serious delusions of western political thinking--the idea that a human society is always best conceived as a closed system obeying fixed rules. And, in essays on
      Don Quixote, museums, Celan's poetry, Heidegger's brother Fritz, Richard Rorty, and bourgeois philosophy, Geuss reflects on how cultural artifacts can lead us to embrace or reject conventional assumptions about the world. While paying particular attention to the relative political roles played by rule-following, utilitarian calculations of interest, and aspirations to lead a collective life of a certain kind, Geuss discusses a wide range of related issues, including the distance critics need from their political systems, the extent to which history can enlighten politics, and the possibility of utopian thinking in a world in which action retains its urgency.<br>

  Abstract: The Skeptic Dispositionwas written in the early eighties during the heyday of deconstruction and reader-centered criticism. The scene has changed, but the critical orientation represented by these “movements” has not disappeared. Rather it has been sublimated and to an extent transformed in the “ideology critique” that dominates literary studies at this moment. The most enduring effect of deconstruction has been the subversion of all universalist or foundationalist claims to truth. In the Marxist canon, ideology has as one of its principal meanings “false consciousness,” which is a kind of universalizing thought that conceals the particular, self-interested (class) motives that<br>

As a start, I shall provide a rough outline of the kind of framework in which we talk about postmodernism. Secondly, I shall try to show<br>

  Abstract: Since the topic of changing cultural epochs, ends and beginnings, is in the fin de siècle air, it might be worth asking whether the one we may conceivably be experiencing is of a kind that will permit the survival of literary studies, a term I use in a sense that the sequel should make clear, or indeed of literature, a term I use in a sense that will still seem innocent to some, though condemned by many others as tainted by nostalgia for the aesthetic, redolent of a hateful elitism, an instrument of ideological oppression.<br>

  Abstract: The contemplative tradition in Western art was an erotic tradition. Violent and exalted, eroticism took many forms, but it was always present in that moment when the contemplator took to his heart the object of his desire. When this kind of absorption occurred in the asymmetry of viewer and painting, it generally hinged on invention, that is, on the subject portrayed. When it occurred in the asymmetry of artist and painting, it hinged on the manifold experience of previsualization, that is, on the instant of choosing the subject. The pathetic and affective fallacies played a role in both asymmetries.<br>

They are only suggestions, not rules. The architect and his client are free to accept or reject them. However, if they do accept them, they increase their chances of obtaining the kind of architecture to which they aspire. My argument is this: as these archetypes are inspired by places that are elegant and successful, they are likely to produce an elegant architecture.<br>

  Abstract: The existence of an increased level of environmental consciousness, of the kind experienced in the 1980s, will create new opportunities for change. However, this situation in itself does not prefigure what the outcomes of that change will look like. Relations with our environment will not be set once and for all or encapsulated in one big “action plan,” but will arise out of much trial and error, changed individual behaviour, political dispute and compromise, and diverse policy initiatives developed over time and unique to specific circumstances.<br>

Unlike Humpty Dumpty, we shall never completely restrain the words’ plurality of meanings; the words will always evoke much more than what we want them to say – or much less. Because language is polysemic, there is an ambiguity that cannot be resolved. A language is a system.

On the other hand, the Heideggerian efforts on behalf of ontology merged into the universe of hermeneutic interpretation.

If a death is thought to have been needless—or worse, politically motivated—mourning may well take on the trappings of public protest. Along with the official rituals of church and state, we often see, as the editors of this volume suggest, a kind of “grassroots memorialization,” in which individuals are mourned as a form of social action. When the causes of death are objectionable, foreseeable, or avoidable, people often mourn publicly in protest (Margry<br>

  Book Title: Academic Anthropology and the Museum-Back to the Future<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Bouquet Mary<br>
  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicization of culture, finds its counterpart in the growing interest by social scientists in material culture, much of which is to be found in museums. Not surprisingly, anthropologists in particular are turning their attention again to museums, after decades of neglect, during which fieldwork became the hallmark of modern anthropology - so much so that the "social" and the "material" parted company so radically as to produce a kind of knowledge gap between historical collections and the intellectuals who might have benefitted from working on these material representations of culture. Moreover it was forgotten that museums do not only present the "pastness" of things. A great deal of what goes on in contemporary museums is literally about planning the shape of the future: making culture materialize involves mixing things from the past, taking into account current visions, and knowing that the scenes constructed will shape the perspectives of future generations. However, the (re-)invention of museum anthropology presents a series of challenges for academic teaching and research, as well as for the work of cultural production in contemporary museums - issues that are explored in this volume.<br>

  Abstract: At least since Plato, critical thinkers have been aware of a key problem at the heart of Western civilization. Although knowledge is revered and given centrality as the keystone of all that is good and true, there is no agreement on how to define it, and knowledge comes in many guises. Michael Polanyi, for example, famously pointed out that “we know more than we can tell.” He called this kind of knowledge “tacit knowledge”—the kind of acquired, taken-for-granted skills that are essential to using computers, for example (Polanyi 1958). But precisely because tacit knowledge is acquired almost unconsciously and<br>

  Abstract: When we are bored, we allow ourselves a certain liberty that can take the form of a kind of self-conscious pause. This is a moment of loneliness that sometimes leads us to deep reflections concerning the human condition. Such an experience is democratically available to anyone who is willing and able to move past the distractions offered up as the fruits of the social contract, to resist the way our commodities come to establish themselves as the conditional terms through which we live together. The most democratic claim we may make in this regard is that we might all be<br>

  Abstract: For the environmentalist and literary critic alike, “nature” has multiple meanings. The zoologist Colin Tudge (2005) observes that “
                  alldefinitions of nature are simply for convenience, helping us to focus on the particular aspect that we happen to be thinking about at the time.” Of the General Prologue to Chaucer’sCanterbury Tales(1387), the literary critic John F. Danby (1961) notes that for Chaucer, the word has three dimensions: Nature is a kind of goddess, the collective force of animate life; it is the material world of organic growth and change; and it is the responsive disposition in the hearts<br>

Each type of question requires its own type of model; it defines the empirical criteria that a model should meet and thereby instructs how the model should be constructed.

To do so, these questions will be compared with other types of scientific questions, labeled as why-questions and how much-questions.

  Abstract: Recent scholarship on Catalan culture has tended to focus on space, urban geography and memory in relation to place. The city of Barcelona has been the obvious case study, not just because of its international projection, but also because of its position as a site of symbolic struggles with regards to Catalan identity (see Epps, 2004; Johnson, 2006; Resina, 2008a).

Put simply, according to the designative view, a word is a sign that ‘stands in for’ by serving as a substitute, or kind of proxy, for the object or idea it represents.¹ It is predicated on the long-held belief in the hierarchical dependence of language on the prior existence of thought, a position known in philosophy as ‘internalism.’ Herder rejects the very possibility of non-symbolic thought and instead develops a view of language<br>

The intertextuality¹ in question is of a very special kind since no texts by other writers are concerned.

  Abstract: In an extraordinary recent encounter, the French thinkers Alain Badiou and Jean-Claude Milner divide strenuously over the sense of contemporary political action. For Milner, we must now recognise that ‘the heart of the question of politics’ is ‘the issue of bodies and their survival’.² Accepting this ‘hard kernel’ of the political entails that we adopt a sceptical position vis-à-vis political action, in which a certain kind of pragmatism should order our actions. For Badiou, by contrast, such a position is tantamount to an abandonment of political militancy as such. As is well known, he instead proposes a reconstruction of ‘the<br>

There is of course also a kind of irony involved when poststructuralism is chided as ‘bourgeois’ by the vanguards of Marxist orthodoxy, who over the last decades have condemned every genuine insurrection against bourgeois order, from May ’68 to December 2008 in Greece.

It is apparent that in the Westernised world, the working class seldom vote for political parties or pursue political matters representative of their real interests.

  Abstract: Being able to analyse different types of text is an essential skill for students of literature. Texts is a new kind of book which shows students how to use literary theory to approach a wide range of literary, cultural and media texts of the kind studied on today’s courses. These texts range from short stories, autobiographies, political speeches, websites and lyrics to films such as The Matrix and Harry Potter and from television’s Big Brother to shopping malls, celebrities, and rock videos.Each chapter combines an introduction to the text and aspects of its critical reception with an analysis using one of sixteen key approaches, from established angles like feminism, postcolonial studies and deconstruction to newer areas such as ecocriticism, trauma theory, and ethical criticism. Each chapter also indicates alternative ways of reading the text by drawing on other critical approaches. Texts:*is the first student guide to examine visual, virtual and performance texts alongside written texts reflecting the broadening range of the contemporary literature syllabus*demonstrates clearly how students can analyse a familiar text in different ways, a core skill which many find difficult*provides a student introduction to contemporary culture via well known popular texts and literary theories.<br>

His most scathing commentary on this tendency is that those who engage in this kind of defection from the duties of friendship assume that their behaviour will not be open to serious criticism; such men take it that others will assume that only an extremely important reason could have led them to cast friendship aside. Cicero presents power, influence, manipulation and weakness as factors both intimately related and antithetical to the practice of friendship.<br>

Such in-depth changes, however, are at best demanding and at worst painful processes.

  Abstract: In the previous two chapters we have encountered, in Mallarmé and Badiou, but also in Nietzsche and Grosz, a thematisation of action as a kind of wager or bet upon what will have happened. The idea of the future as a wager suggests probability as a more obvious mathematics of the future perfect than set theory. There can be no question that our cognitive control of the future must involve us in an assessment of the probability of events that we foresee, and it seems likely that the events that we do not foresee are the lowest probability events.

  Abstract: For Deleuze, all thinking begins in a kind of pathos. This is because thinking must be distinguished from knowledge or mental activity in general: remembering, sensing, imagining and so on. These modes of cognition remain at the purely empirical level of recognisable objects. Thought, however, goes beyond the limits of the recognisable and thus needs to be grasped in a way which distinguishes it from our day-to-day cognition of the world.¹ In other words, thought goes beyond the given differences which allow us to recognise the objects of our experience, and in turn leads towards a realm in which differences<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding chapters, I tried to show how psychoanalysis emerged as an antiphilosophy and, in this emergence, came to establish certain routines as its own: the diagnosis of slavery as the consequence of the encounter between the body and language, a concomitant intrication of sexual protest, the ambivalence of love as at once mediating, obscuring and transforming this relation between slavery and sex, and, finally, the development of an ethics of poetic invention. This chapter, by contrast, turns its attentions to a different kind of thinker: one who begins as a self-nominated ‘philosopher’, but who, in covertly drawing from<br>

From the sociological standpoint of Elizabeth Burns the “theatrical metaphor” generated conventions that served as constitutive agreements for knowledge.¹ Yet this metaphor is also, for her, a “mode of perception,” a basic phenomenological category like those described by Ernst Cassirer or Susanne K. Langer, which produces the social concepts that make theater—and any other concomitant forms of analogical “theatricality” in other contexts—possible.² Theater for Burns, then, is not a kind of knowledge<br>

It began, most likely, with the coming of nineteenth-century Protestant missionaries to China, men and women who, shocked at the seeming impassivity of the Chinese they encountered, attributed their lack of affect to a kind of racial impermeability to pain and suffering.

Cinema engages us across a wider range of our embodied mental capacities than any other medium of representation, extending from low-level reflexes to abstract reflection. Cinema engages not only our visual and auditory senses, in a direct fashion, but also our senses of touch and balance and, perhaps, even those of taste and smell, in an indirect fashion.

  Abstract: “There’s my hometown!” I shout. I catch a murder mystery set in Portland, Oregon. It’s about a pretty woman, a handsome man, and a villain hell-bent on harming her. Also, her outdoor furniture, it happens, is the kind I’d bought a month before. “Look!” I announce to the room, “There’s Sellwood Bridge! I rode across it every day going to college.” These insights are pleasurable to me alone. Others, no matter how kindly disposed, do not find scenes of a bridge and rainy streets interesting. My fascination with Portland defines sentimentality. Like other people’s photos of their grandkids, my recollections<br>

  Abstract: Let us now turn from memory to its alter ego, heritage, while asking the same question as before: how are we to understand, in terms of time and the order of time, the proliferation and universalization of heritage that we have witnessed over the last quarter of a century? More precisely, what regime of historicity is implied by the phenomenon that some have described as the “meteoric rise of the heritage industry” in the 1990s? Did this taste for the past, for everything old, emerge suddenly as a kind of nostalgia for an older regime of historicity that had in<br>

  Book Title: Reimagining the Sacred-Richard Kearney Debates God with James Wood, Catherine Keller, Charles Taylor, Julia Kristeva, Gianni Vattimo, Simon Critchley, Jean-Luc Marion, John Caputo, David Tracey, Jens Zimmermann, and Merold Westphal<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Zimmermann Jens<br>
  Abstract: Contemporary conversations about religion and culture are framed by two reductive definitions of secularity. In one, multiple faiths and nonfaiths coexist free from a dominant belief in God. In the other, we deny the sacred altogether and exclude religion from rational thought and behavior. But is there a third way for those who wish to rediscover the sacred in a skeptical society? What kind of faith, if any, can be proclaimed after the ravages of the Holocaust and the many religion-based terrors since?<br>

  Book Title: Narrating Evil-A Postmetaphysical Theory of Reflective Judgment<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Allen Amy<br>
  Abstract: Drawing on Immanuel Kant's and Hannah Arendt's ideas about reflective judgment, Lara argues that narrative plays a key role in helping societies acknowledge their pasts. Particular stories haunt our consciousness and lead to a kind of examination and dialogue that shape notions of morality. A powerful description of a crime can act as a filter, helping us to draw conclusions about what constitutes a moral wrong, and public debates over these narratives allow us to construct a more accurate picture of historical truth, leading to a better understanding of why such actions are possible.<br>

  Abstract: To me lucid dreaming is the most interesting of the contemporary Euro-American obsessions with dreams, providing a kind of escape from the world of everyday reality into the dream realm. Several lucid dreamers experience what one might reasonably label dream-visions that provide insights into a transcendental reality, not based on any known religion but rather on an intuitive personal insight into such an imagined reality. In that sense they constitute another form of “secular spirituality” for those who have been disenchanted with traditional religion.<br>

  Book Title: Reading the-The Literary Aims of a Theravada Buddhist History<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Scheible Kristin<br>
  Abstract: Reading the Mahavamsaadvocates a new, literary approach to this text by revealing its embedded reading advice (to experiencesamvegaandpasada) and affective work of metaphors (the Buddha's dharma as light) and salient characters (nagas). Kristin Scheible argues that theMahavamsarequires a particular kind of reading. In the text's proem, special instructions draw readers to the metaphor of light and thenagas, or salient snake-beings, of the first chapter.Nagasare both model worshippers and unworthy hoarders of Buddha's relics. As nonhuman agents, they challenge political and historicist readings of the text. Scheible sees these slippery characters and the narrative's potent and playful metaphors as techniques for refocusing the reader's attention on the text's emotional aims. Her work explains theMahavamsa's central motivational role in contemporary Sri Lankan Buddhist and nationalist circles. It also speaks broadly to strategies of reading religious texts and to the internal and external cues that give such works lives beyond the page.<br>

  Abstract: The twentieth century, particularly on its analytic side, was undeniably marked by what Jocelyn Benoist does not hesitate to call the “race to reference.”¹ Interest in the problem of reference would be a kind of reaction against Kantian idealism and, in general, against any form of representationalism. With Bernard Bolzano and Gottlob Frege, later with the early Husserl and of course Bertrand Russell, a desire was expressed to return to the object, against a too-exclusive concern for our representations of the object. In a word, the thematization of reference was presented as an offensive against the transcendental—which, by means<br>

What is more, because it served as a beginner's guide for its author as well, allowing him to undertake an initial survey of problems that would preoccupy him for the remainder of his life, it has the additional advantage that it can offer us a glimpse into what might be called the 'genesis of the Blumenbergian world.'"-from the Afterword by Robert Savage<br>

On closer examination, one finds that the town contains three largely separate social groups: Alternatives, Main Streeters, and Regulars. These categories are not based on race or ethnic origins. Rather, social distinctions in Viroqua are based ultimately on residents' ideas about what a community is and why it matters.<br>

  Book Title: Becoming John Updike-Critical Reception, 1958-2010<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Mazzeno Laurence W.<br>
  Abstract: When John Updike died in 2009, tributes from the literary establishment were immediate and fulsome. However, no one reading reviews of Updike's work in the late 1960s would have predicted that kind of praise for a man who was known then as a brilliant stylist who had nothing to say. What changed? Why? And what is likely to be his legacy? These are the questions that "Becoming John Updike" pursues by examining the journalistic and academic response to his writings. Several things about Updike's career make a reception study appropriate. First, he was prolific: he began publishing fiction and essays in 1956, published his first book in 1958, and from then on, brought out at least one new book each year. Second, his books were reviewed widely - usually in major American newspapers and magazines, and often in foreign ones as well. Third, Updike quickly became a darling of academics; the first book about his work was published in 1967, less than a decade after his own first book. More than three dozen books and hundreds of articles of academic criticism have been devoted to Updike. The present volume will appeal to the continuing interest in Updike's writing among academics and general readers alike. Laurence W. Mazzeno is President Emeritus of Alvernia University. Among other books, he has written volumes on Austen, Dickens, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold for Camden House's Literary Criticism in Perspective series.<br>

  Book Title: Representing the "Good German" in Literature and Culture after 1945-Altruism and Moral Ambiguity<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Schönfeld Christiane<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of the Second World War, both the allied occupying powers and the nascent German authorities sought Germans whose record during the war and the Nazi period could serve as a counterpoint to the notion of Germans as evil. That search has never really stopped. In the past few years, we have witnessed a burgeoning of cultural representations of this "other" kind of Third Reich citizen - the "good German" - as opposed to the committed Nazi or genocidal maniac. Such representations have highlighted individuals' choices in favor of dissenting behavior, moral truth, or at the very least civil disobedience. The "good German's" counterhegemonic practice cannot negate or contradict the barbaric reality of Hitler's Germany, but reflects a value system based on humanity and an "other" ideal community. This volume of new essays explores postwar and recent representations of "good Germans" during the Third Reich, analyzing the logic of moral behavior, cultural and moral relativism, and social conformity found in them. It thus draws together discussions of the function and reception of "Good Germans" in Germany and abroad.

  Book Title: Modern German Thought from Kant to Habermas-An Annotated German-Language Reader<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Large Duncan<br>
  Abstract: German-language thinkers such as Kant, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud are central to modernity. Yet their reception in the English-speaking world has largely depended on translations, a situation that has often hampered full engagement with the rhetorical and philosophical complexity of the German history of ideas. The present volume, the first of its kind, is a response to this situation. After an introduction charting the remarkable flowering of German-language thought since the eighteenth century, it offers extracts -- in the original German -- from sixteen major philosophical texts, with extensive introductions and annotations in English. All extracts are carefully chosen to introduce the individual thinkers while allowing the reader to pursue broader themes such as the fate of reason or the history of modern selfhood. The book offers students and scholars of German a complement to linguistic, historical, and literary study by giving them access to the wealth of German-language philosophy. It represents a new way into the work of a succession of thinkers who have defined modern philosophy and thus remain of crucial relevance today. The philosophers: Immanuel Kant, G. W. F. Hegel, Ludwig Feuerbach, Karl Marx, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Georg Lukács, Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, Jürgen Habermas.

  Abstract: Pacheco is regarded by some as the foremost Mexican poet after Paz, as well as being an important prose writer. From the outset, however, we may feel a certain surprise at finding him categorized alongside poets like Cardenal, Fernández Retamar and Dalton. The kind of adjectives commonly used to describe his poetry: “meditative”, “introspective”, “philosophical”, “sceptical” and “ironic” seem to set him apart. Indeed, if we perceive, with Alemany Bey, colloquial poetry to be closely associated with overt political commitment and protest (1977, 85–6), Pacheco does stand apart. Though such elements are present in some of his poems, his<br>

  Abstract: Western culture is dominated by representation—however, in 1993 in a series of essays, Jean-Luc Nancy counters this paradigm of all signification processes from a culturally critical perspective with a new paradigm, and proclaims “the birth to presence.”¹ In the course of this paradigm shift from representation to presence and as a consequence of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht’s work, contemporary literary criticism has also taken an interest in “what meaning cannot convey.”² Yet, to speak of a “new” paradigm implies a kind of mastery, since presence basically represents an outdated paradigm in two respects.

  Book Title: A Companion to Friedrich Nietzsche-Life and Works<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Bishop Paul<br>
  Abstract: Nietzsche looms over modern literature and thought; according to Gottfried Benn, "everything my generation discussed, thought through innerly; one could say: suffered; or one could even say: took to the point of exhaustion - all of it had already been said . . . by Nietzsche; all the rest was just exegesis." Nietzsche's influence on intellectual life today is arguably as great; witness the various societies, journals, and websites and the steady stream of papers, collections, and monographs. This ‘Companion’ offers new essays from the best Nietzsche scholars, emphasizing the interrelatedness of his life and thought, eschewing a superficial biographical method but taking seriously his claim that great philosophy is “the self-confession of its author and a kind of unintended and unremarked ‘memoir’.” Each essay examines a major work by Nietzsche; together, they offer an advanced introduction for students of German Studies, philosophy, and comparative literature as well as for the lay reader. Re-establishing the links between Nietzsche's philosophical texts and their biographical background, the volume alerts Nietzsche scholars and intellectual historians to the internal development of his thought and the aesthetic construction of his identity as a philosopher.

  Abstract: This chapter explores some of the ways in which art museums speak with and about their own pasts through focusing historically on events at the National Gallery in the 1980s and 1990s. The ongoing revalorisation of Victorian interiors within museums which commenced in those decades has led to a spate of restoration projects. These ostensibly reverse the modernist project of stripping away (or, more accurately, overlaying) Victorian features. Such restorations re-inscribe a heritage of Victorian museology into the modern-day art museum as a building and as an institution.

Abstract: Ziba Mir‐Hosseini’s study focuses, as the title indicates, on gender or, more particularly, on the status of women in Islam. To say only that is to say far too little, however. Mir‐Hosseini’s remarkable contribution rests on her willingness to focus on modes of argument current among scholars of Islamic religious law in Iran. In this, she presents herself neither as a reformist interpreter of Islam nor as a Muslim apologist. Rather, Mir‐Hosseini is a kind of interested rapporteur, whose willingness to take seriously the reflections of recognized religious specialists enables her to present readers with the variety of authoritative opinion regarding women’s roles in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Extensive interviews are joined with close readings of scholarly texts to illustrate the approaches Mir‐Hosseini classifies as traditionalist, neotraditionalist, and modernist. Everyone interested in Islam, contemporary debates about gender roles, or styles of argument in ethics will benefit from reading Mir‐Hosseini’s book. Indeed, portions of the volume might be used in courses that introduce students to ethics through an examination of arguments about moral problems or gender roles.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur, Paul<br>
Abstract: What about the last dimension of the constitution of moral action, the dimension of practical reason? Ricoeur agrees with Hans‐Georg Gadamer that judgment and interpretation cannot be removed from the application of laws and principles to particular cases. Hence, he also accepts Ronald Dworkin’s argument against legal positivism. Because legal positivism identifies the meaning of a law with its original intent, it is left no recourse in hard cases that seem to be outside the purview of this intent except to appeal to the discretionary power of the judge. In contrast, Ricoeur emphasizes a criterion of validity that looks to the narrative coherence of a legal judgment in view of the history of the legal enterprise. Yet, Ricoeur thinks that Dworkin misses the opportunity to coordinate his “narrativist notion of fit” (p. 114) with a theory of argumentation borrowed from Habermas and the Erlangen School. Just as Rawls’s theory of justice lends formalism to the selection of principles of justice within a community of shared understandings and aspirations, Habermas’s discourse theory lends formalism to Dworkin’s interpretive judgments insofar as interpreters must argue for their interpretations under a set of discourse rules. Indeed, Ricoeur sees the ideal endpoint of a trial as a kind of ideal speech situation in which both winner and loser recognize each other as subjects of rights whose causes should have been heard, who made plausible arguments, and whose arguments were heard (p. 131).<br>

Abstract: These questions date from the very beginning of Christianity. Thus replied Paul to those who denied the resurrection:
         
               Here we encounter the crucial metaphor of the seed, which affirms the necessity and redeeming significance of death and immediately directs resurrection discourses toward issues of decay, fertility, developmental processes, continuity, and identity. To each kind of seed its own body. Then, Paul continues,But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. [1 Cor. 15:35–38]
            
               The resurrection body will be a new body, imperishable, glorious, powerful, and spiritual. Yet it will be somehow identical to the terrestrial one.so also with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. [1 Cor. 15:42–44]

Abstract: Second, we would ask where he assumes it is
         appropriate to speakabout his interpretation. Does he assume that it is somehow his duty to talk about his interpretation of the news or that it is impolite to entertain that kind of conversation, or that talk does not matter? Finally, we would askwhat image of the wider world, and his relation to it, does he have in mind when offering his interpretation of the news? Studies of resistance (Hall1973; Morley1980; Scott1990; Lancaster1988; Willis 1981; Kelley1996) describe long‐standing communities resisting clear, structural domination: Working‐class listeners relating to mainstream news, peasants or slaves relating to official pronunciamentos, or African‐American or working‐class students relating to white, middle‐class teachers. But not all modes of interpreting dominant culture are only either “resisting” or “complying with” elites or powerful institutions; they do not just say “yes” or “no,” but articulate whole new meanings. Second, resistance studies show situations in which members actively perceive oppression as coming directly from an employer, schoolteacher, or political ruler who is immediately present or to whom members can speak directly. But our studies show situations in which the source of oppression is not very clear to members. Oppression may be coming from diffuse sources, in which there is no clearly embodied oppressor against whom to rebel (Hayward2000).<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: “What interests us here … is how art functions as communication,” Luhmann says (p. 39), and that is the crux of his conception of art: it is the medium and not the message that is important. The work of art is produced
      exclusivelyfor the purpose of communication and that it accomplishes this goal or fails to do so by facing the usual, and perhaps increased, risks involved in all communication. Art communicatesby using perceptions contrary to their primary purpose. … Art seeks a different kind of relationship between perception and communication—one that is irritating and defies normality—and just this is communicated” (pp. 22–23; author’s emphasis). Thus, what is most interesting about Luhmann’s view of art is also what is most interesting about his general theory: its sophisticated and elaborate explorations in the evolutionary development of the media of communication, which are perhaps unparalleled in contemporary theory. But due to his bracketing of the cultural dimension of art, he views the message or meaning that the artwork itself claims to convey as wholly residual. And what is art without meaning? Not only is this a problem for art, it is a problem for Luhmann’s theory; he cannot clearly define the source of art’s “irritating” character nor the “normality” it seeks to defy because he brackets the ideas and ideals that constitute the meaning (read: message) of any conceivable artwork. This gives the 300‐plus pages of Luhmann’s book a rather repetitive and tiring quality; it constantly seems as if he is writingaroundart rather thanaboutit. This is the price he pays for a theory in which the criterion is systems complexity rather than cultural meaning.<br>

Abstract: Let us return to Hegel’s interpretation of Adam’s privilege in the book of Genesis. There, man has the power to name, to understand, and thus to dominate; but Adam exercises this privilege only upon the animals, never upon God or upon himself. Why do these two escape naming and thus escape the comprehension and, finally, the domination of man? That God would escape is conceived without any difficulty: the Creator is not easily understood, and thus named, by his creature. But why is it that man does not name himself? No interdict is brought to bear here. Nothing more than the second commandment is necessary, which forbids making “for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above” (Exod. 20:4)—anything, therefore, that would claim to represent God through comprehension. But is man, too, “in heaven above”? Most certainly—for this is the decisive paradox—because that which is fitting for God (of whom no name, no image, and no concept can claim comprehension) is also fitting for man: man, and he alone among all the living, was created not “according to [his] kind” but “in [the] image … [and] likeness” of God (Gen. 1:24, 26). This paradox receives a precise commentary from Saint Augustine: “
         be renewed in the newness of your mind. That is not a makingaccording to kind[secundum genus], as if renewal were achieved by imitating a neighbour’s example or by living under the authority of a human superior. For you did not say ‘Let man be made according to his kind’ [secundum genus], but ‘Let us make man according to our image and likeness,’ so we may prove what your will is.”24Man remains unimaginable, because he is formed in the image of the One who admits no image whatsoever. By right, man resembles nothing, because he resembles nothing other than the One who is properly characterized by incomprehensibility, the One who David Tracy has named “the Incomprehensible‐Comprehensible God.”25Or again, if God remains incomprehensible, man, who r~<br>

Abstract: Just as North Africa provided a defining perspective that turned his thinking upside down, teaching in Brazil and captivity in German prisoner‐of‐war camps also gave Braudel important reflective distance. Brazil provided a different kind of colonial perspective to look across the ocean at the Mediterranean as through a distant mirror. For Braudel, Brazil’s stark class divisions resembled an earlier stage of European economic development and a way to look back in time at the origins of modern capitalism in the Mediterranean. “Brazil is the same civilization [as ours], but not at the same age. It is true that Brazil allowed me to arrive at a certain conception of history that I would not have had if I had remained round about the Mediterranean.”
         115Prison camp, in contrast, brought enforced solitude to contemplate the whole, away from the jumble of details in Braudel’s notes. Prison was a “long time of testing … a good school. It teaches patience, tolerance.” The Mediterranean “distracted me in the true etymological meaning of the word,” and Braudel wrote his book. “Only my memory permitted this tour de force. Had it not been for my imprisonment, I would surely have written quite a different book.… Far removed from our persons and our daily misery, history was being made, shifting slowly, as slowly as the ancient life of the Mediterranean, whose perdurability and majestic immobility has so often moved me. So it was that I consciously set forth in search of a historical language—the most profound I could grasp or invent—in order to present unchanging (or at least very slowly changing) conditions which stubbornly assert themselves over and over again.”116Braudel’s memory juxtaposed the repetition of the routines of daily life amid a sea of imperceptible change with the retelling of the same events during the reign of Philip II from different frames of reference in the three parts of his book, so that the temporal linkage between structure‐conjuncture‐event woul~<br>

Abstract: It seems likely, as Yates notes (Yates, “Genres of Organizational Communication,” p. 314), that tab stops made indentation easier and therefore the typing of lists (and, later, bullets?). It should also be remembered that the spatial organization of the document provided the model for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or computer desktop. It is not an accident that the commercial/bureaucratic scene and not, say, the laboratory, left this crucial imprint on computer design. This point should deter us from lapsing into technodeterminist styles of argument when we are dealing with a mutual interaction of social forms and technology. For an unapologetically technodeterminist argument on the relation between the typewriter and writing, see Friedrich Kittler,
               Gramophone, Film, Typewriter,trans. Geoffrey Winthrop‐Young and Michael Wutz (Stanford, Calif., 1999). Kittler is interested in Nietzsche’s use of the typewriter as a consequence of his failing vision and by extrapolation in the determination of the most rarified philosophical discourse by media. He is also interested in the emergence of a corps of women writers (typists), but uninterested in the kind of writing that was actually typed by women in large organizations.<br>

Author(s): McNay Lois <br>
Abstract: McNay’s
      Gender and Agency, while differing fromGender in the Mirrorin focus, shares in Meyers’s vexation with existing approaches to agency. McNay is particularly suspicious of theorists of cultural studies who “impute to certain everyday practices a kind of inherently subversive status” (4). She argues that the widely deployed idea of everyday resistance has no impact when the interplay between individual behavior and social norms is ignored: “This, in turn, indicates the necessity of contextualizing agencywithin power relationsin order to understand how acts deemed as resistant may transcend their immediate sphere in order to transform collective behavior and norms” (4, emphasis added). One can see that McNay is explicitly conscious of the tension that lurks in Meyers’s work, and the point is repeated throughout the book: “Analysis of the way in which certain subversive practices may get taken up and collectivized is important if resistance is to mean anything other than the truism that individuals do not reproduce social norms in a straightforward fashion” (129). Yet even more than Meyers’s, McNay’s argument glides from the language of mandate in her proposals (analogous to Meyers’s “musts”) to the language of possibility and potential in the results: a new theory of contextualized feminist agency could, may, might lead to collective action and greater freedom for women.<br>

Abstract: While Gare acknowledges that there are complexities and anomalies not adequately accounted for by this brief characterization of modern thought, nevertheless he contends that the history of modern philosophy and science becomes properly intelligible only when construed in this way [
         5]. He argues that this sketch of a revisionist history of philosophy could be the basis of a more coherent history than we have seen to date. So, building on the kind of account that we also see in Budd [3], Gare goes considerably further [5]; he contextualizes certain philosophical traditions from the viewpoint of today’s world and the conditions we now face, wherein a “whole of knowledge” approach is not only called for but also viable; he retrieves from current thinking a position that offers possibilities; and he suggests that we review the work of certain thinkers, such as Schelling, given these moves. Whereas Budd concludes that the categories central to LIS theory should be essence, being, interpretation, perception, self and other, and intentionality [3], Gare offers us a broader theory [11]. Calling for development of more adequate categories to define the nature of the cosmos, he argues that matter, space, time, and motion should be replaced by activity; order and potentiality; process, structure, and event; cause; and spatiotemporal position. From Gare we have a sense of the organically integrated, self‐sustaining whole that is human knowledge in motion, and beyond this we have nature as the force that shapes human endeavor [11].<br>

Abstract: We are now in a position to understand the relationship between the cyborg and women of color. At one level there is no relationship, only oneness. Since in the informatics of domination we all cannot help being cyborgs, women of color are cyborgs. But the ultimate relationship is again analogical. Just as the cyborg is a fusion of human and machine, a monstrous and illegitimate fusion, so, the argument goes, is the constituency of women of color, forged as it is without identity. Thus is it not surprising that race sometimes figures in Haraway’s essay in a similar fashion as it does in Rubin’s: “race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts” (Haraway
         1991, 181); “the causes of various women‐headed households are a function of race, class, or sexuality” (167); and “some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high‐tech‐facilitated social relations can make socialist‐feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics” (165). Cyborg identities, mediated through the politics of women of color, help defuse—or to use Wilkerson’s terminology, deny the responsibility of working with—whiteness and white feminist social location. Haraway’s stated reasons for turning to women of color make this clear. Haraway writes: “For me—and for many who share a similar historical location in white, professional middle‐class, female, radical, North American, mid‐adult bodies—the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the US left and US feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition—affinity, not identity” (1991, 155). I argued earlier that analogy functions like a colonial fetish enabling the white feminist theorist to displace racial difference onto a safer notion of similarity. We can now add the following: racial analogy within (white) fem~<br>

Abstract: For the notion of strategic essentialism, see Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography,” in her
            The Spivak Reader, 214–21. Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Frei’s discussion of Midrash contrasts with his criticism of Phillips’s position. He describes Midrash as a practice of reading that is primarily responsible to the community, but in such a way that it enables second‐order discourse to emerge. Indeed, the description above is very close to the type 4 of Barth’s theology. Midrash avoids “parroting” because of its recognition that there are gaps, or problems, within the biblical text—issues that arise within the practice of reading by the community.
         Derasharises from withinpeshat,which, as Loewe describes, always already has a latent dynamism. The priority of the literal sense emerges in how the problems raised by such gaps are resolved—namely, through intratextual reading that relates the words and phrasings of the texts to other scriptural passages. The juxtaposition and interplay of diverse, often “surprising” passages opens the world of understanding for Midrash, without appeal to a general logical framework that would be imported and imposed onto the text. This practice of reading then becomes authoritative for the community—in Frei’s words, “a kind of instruction that has continuity of form.” It is, then, an interpretive practice that is primarily directed toward the community’s self‐understanding—but that can, to some degree, be understood by outsiders, and may make use of alternative logics to help clarify a particular case.<br>

Abstract: In 1977, Lawrence Lipking argued in
      Critical Inquirythat, because the division between text and footnote is never stable, even within the footnote itself—a position we agree with—footnotes should be dispensed with in favor of the marginal note. He wrote, “Fewer and fewer literary critics, these days, would accept the philosophical model of discourse on which the relation between text and note was founded: the clear division between certain knowledge, brought to light in the text, and conjectural or historical evidence, cited below.” Lipking, who wryly noted that “footnotes… stand for a scholarly community, assembled by the author specifically so that he can join it,” hoped to see a revolution in both essayistic form and professionalism. He hoped for a new kind of critic “who considers that community [of footnote‐building scholars] an illusion, fabricated for self‐serving ulterior purposes” and who will “choose another [professional] allegiance” and “scorn the footnote” in favor of “the marginal gloss.”12<br>

Abstract: The large percentage of Americans
         21who identify as fundamentalist or evangelical Christians and who worship at churches like the one associated with Eternal Grace carry with them a kind of theological certainty that both endows them with humility in the face of God’s greatness but also promotes a kind of hubris in the presumption of knowing God’s plan. This certainty also engenders complacency, a troubling aspect of this religious collective memory.22What, after all, does it mean when a large percentage of the American populace adheres to a worldview that negates the importance of intervening in history? As Barbara Rossing writes in her (2004) book,The Rapture Exposed, this kind of faith “leads to ‘appalling ethics’ … because the faithful are relieved of concern for the environment, violence, and everything else except their personal salvation” (as quoted in Moyers2005). Most of the students in Mrs. Barrett’s classroom certainly seemed caught in this theological pitfall, being unwilling as they were to even consider saving Jews when asked to imagine living during the Holocaust.<br>

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Abstract: Paul Ricoeur, in contrast, is one of a few philosophers who offer, however briefly, a phenomenology of forgetting, although he too voices skepticism about an
         ars oblivionalison par with thears memoriae.He distinguishes between three levels or approaches to memory and forgetting. These are obstructed memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire empêchée,on the level of the psychopathological), manipulated memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire manipulée,on the practical or instrumental level), and controlled memory and forgetting (l'oubli et la mémoire commandée/obligée,on the ethical‐political level).110In the last context, forgetting and pardoning are intrinsically linked through the problematic of the past: forgetting, to memory and fidelity to the past; pardoning, to culpability and reconciliation with the past. “Indeed, a happy forgetting is the horizon of the pacified memory.”111Ricoeur further differentiates between forgetting through deletion and a more measured, reserved kind of forgetting, closely connected to the opposition between amnesia and amnesty. In considering amnesty as institutional forgetting, Ricoeur notes that it aims at reconciliation and civil peace.112In this sense one can hypothesize by analogy that persecution, punishment, and eradication, even if explicitly articulated as forgetting, may serve as institutional reminders but can also (sometimes consciously) exacerbate societal tensions.<br>

Abstract: My own interpretation of the significance of childhood for theological ethics—in all of children’s empirical, religious, and social dimensions—reflects normatively the kind of postmodern hermeneutical perspective I have been advancing. That is, childhood calls society to be “fruitful and multiply” in a circular, self‐disruptive, asymmetrical, and ongoing self‐transforming sense. From a child‐centered point of view, human moral responsibility includes responding to the vulnerabilities of others—such as their poverty, incapacity, or powerlessness—in a self‐creative and socially creative way. What must be disrupted or recreated most of all is the world of those who hold social opportunities and power. Marginalized members of society such as children are not only “other” in the negative sense of demanding not to be oppressed but also “other” in the positive sense of requiring a different and new response from those who influence their lives.<br>

Abstract: In this case, the moral imitation of Creation must inevitably remain both hopeful and problematic. At the center of moral creativity lies the ambiguity of human social tension. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his jail cell in Birmingham, Alabama: “I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ‘tension.’ I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a kind of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. … [We need] to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.”
         36Moral intentionality does not find peace and rest—its desired ethical Sabbath—by fixed values and orders alone, however necessary these may be for limiting violence and oppression, but by embracing as far as possible human tension in its possibility for narrating ever more inclusive moral worlds. The negative prohibitions that “separate” or “part” violent persons and groups should ultimately serve the positive possibility for the “participation” of all in creating community between rather than in spite of human difference.<br>

Date: 07 2006<br>
Author(s): Budd John M.<br>
Abstract: Over time, statements such as the LBR have been discussed and alternatives weighed, but librarianship’s discursive practice has, in recent years, largely constituted an orthodoxy that may not be sensitive or responsive to disputation. One voice of this orthodoxy is Robert Hauptman, who writes, “We are free to articulate anything we imagine” [
         30, p. 18], and “If there are more fundamental rights than freedom of thought, then anyone, naturally, can cite those rights when attempting to control what students may read in a class, what libraries may collect, and what Americans may access on the Internet” [30, p. 138]. His first idea is incorrect; there are, in fact, laws that limit what a person can say. Paradoxically, Hauptman also argues against research misconduct on the grounds of responsibility and public interest, but if we are indeed free to say anything we can imagine, we can lie and falsify with impunity. The positive ethos of research integrity is indisputable; violation of the ethos can cause harm. That positive ethos does, however, come into conflict with Hauptman’s first maxim. His second claim is puzzling; if there are more fundamental rights, then those rights probably should supersede a right to access to information. For example, a right to privacy trumps another’s “right” to certain of an individual’s personal information. A right to freedom from harm trumps a person’s “right” to libel another intentionally and with malice. Hauptman also proposes that, in combating censorship, the minority cannot dictate to the majority. However, Paul Ricoeur, arguing for the kind of normative ethics suggested here, says, “Whoever might be a victim must not be sacrificed to the benefit of some common good. This is the anti‐utilitarian point of the Rawlsian theory of justice” [31, p. 65]. It is obvious that the whims of the minority should not hold sway simply because they wish it to be so, but, likewise, the majority should not be able to cause harm to others o~<br>

Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>

Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: As we have seen, there is no place for secrecy or mystery in the Platonic paradigm of responsibility. The Platonic model is a democratic model based on responsibility as universally accessible knowledge and on a demand of transparency. Returning to the memory of Europe, Derrida remarks that as long as Europe pays homage to its Platonic heritage and keeps that memory alive, it “either neglects, represses, or excludes from itself every essential possibility of secrecy and every link between responsibility and the keeping of a secret; everything that allows responsibility to be dedicated to secrecy” (
      GD,p. 34). But apart from seeking to secure the democratic demand of full transparency and generalized accountability, the fact that this heritage seeks to achieve this demand by neglecting, repressing, or excluding the possibility of secrecy clearly suggests some kind of irresponsibility that is inseparable from the demand in question. As Patočka’s analyses of the decadence of modern Europe seek to show, it takes very little for such a democratic model of responsibility and of rendering reason to become totalitarian. Indeed, the legitimate demand intrinsic to the concept of responsibility to publicly account for oneself and one’s deeds can easily turn into a means of oppression—as has amply been demonstrated under Stalinism and Zhdanovism in the former Soviet Union, but examples of which can also be found in the U.S. with its obsession with public confession; thus this conception of responsibility based on the demand for knowledge must also, to quote Derrida, “call for respecting whatever refuses a certain responsibility, for example, the responsibility to respond before any and every instituted tribunal” (OH,p. 79).16This right not to respond and to keep a secret is the necessary antidote to a conception of responsibility that, based on knowledge, can always become a tool for the benefit of the worst. But the Christian paradigm of responsibility, which rests on th~<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 509555<br>
Date: 10 2007<br>
Author(s): Flake Kathleen<br>
Abstract: This is not to argue against the kind of verification fundamental to scientific history, though it does side with Warnock’s observation that a positivist approach can miss the role of human imagination in not merely perceiving but also constructing reality. Rather, it is to argue for something besides the power of description at work in certain narratives, especially those that rise to the level of mythos and make a claim to religious authority. Smith’s narratives do not display fact to be assented to but draw the reader into a malleable reality by means of the malleable plots that traditionally provided the basis for Jewish and Christian ethos and ethic. It can be said that Smith was translating time, not text. Specifically, he translated biblical time in service to, he said, an “ushering in of the dispensation of the fullness of times … a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers … from the days of Adam even to the present time.”
         97Whatever his intention, the effect was to deploy the biblical text in a manner that radically subverted centuries of theologizing on who God is and how humans are to worship God.<br>

Abstract: Obviously, the vogue for shopping for alternative pasts has direct consequences for the ways in which rewriting affects cultural memory. Transforming our relationship to the past, to tradition, and to the founding myths of culture, it equally undermines the possibility of projecting the future—of representing the future as project.
         16Whereas rewriting has long been a powerful political and ideological tool in the shaping and reshaping of collective memory, its critical effectiveness in a literary marketplace that increasingly works according to the logics of consumption is transformed. Today, memory and shopping are linked, not only because consumerism is an integral part of contemporary commemorative practices but also because memories and memorability are central to a society of consumption that has embraced experience as its key marketing concept. In their handbook of business strategy and innovation,The Experience Economy: Work Is Theatre and Every Business a Stage(1999), Joseph Pine and James Gilmore argue that “Experiences represent an existing but previously unarticulatedgenre of economic output” (ix). Attempting to convince companies that they ought to “script and stage compelling experiences,” as the blurb on the book’s front flap reads, they write: “In the emerging Experience Economy, companies must realize that they make memories, not goods” (Pine and Gilmore1999, 100). An economy that is geared toward producing memories should certainly make us wary of the kind of memory into which we are buying. Producing competing memories as consumer goods, it is also an economy that puts re‐vision at the heart of economic culture and consumerism at the center of rewriting as a memory‐practice.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Abstract: Airy theoretical statements like these begin to sound downright saccharine when the subject turns to religion. Consider the following statement: “Presence [oddly, this term is sometimes capitalized by Reynolds, sometimes not] is an inescapable existential presupposition, a kind of eschatological affirmation built into the praxis of availability. … When we encounter the presence of the other, we cannot help but say ‘it is good’” (147). One wants to know how these sentences would be received by a Palestinian attempting to negotiate an Israeli checkpoint or by a student at one of the stricter jihadist‐leaning madrassas in Pakistan. For approximately two pages (150–52), Reynolds dwells on the darker realities of pluralism and difference: violence, mistrust, fear, imperialism, and domination. Undeterred, however, he moves swiftly to “the recovery of trust,” arguing that despite all appearances to the contrary, “religious faith [is] a ‘saving’ performance” that “places us … in a trustworthy and gratuitous ultimate environment, one that resists falsification by the conditions of finitude” (158). One senses that reality is not receiving due attention.<br>

Abstract: The chapter “Nobody's Weakness” closes with Arthur ruminating gloomily (and rather opaquely) about how “it might be better to flow away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility to happiness with its insensibility to pain” (
            LD,p. 200). Though “flow away” seems at first only a metaphor, so abstract and disembodied is the reverie that there is a kind of phantasmal grammatical alternative trickling into the melancholic drift of the prose. In this way that second infinitive of compensation or complementation may also faintly evoke a sense that Arthur indeed wishes to mix materially with the lethal waters, literally (and more idiomatically) to “compound … with” them.<br>

Abstract: At first Marcel neglects his grandmother’s death; in “deny[ing]” her, he “died to himself” by adopting an identity discordant with the amorous self that existed in “mutual predestination” with her soul.
         30When involuntary memory strikes him with the recollection of his grandmother’s solicitous gesture kneeling at his feet, and this vision returns to him his previous amorous self, he appreciates this old self’s superiority and would like to get it permanently back; this self is superior to the other selves, “which have succeeded one another in [him] since a while ago,” because it brings back to him his “veritable grandmother”31—neither an incidental simulacrum of remembrance, nor the “kind of beast”32turning and tossing in the bed of her agony (which “had only her name” and he “regretted so little”), but rather her “living reality.”33This is perhaps the most emblematic instance in Proust’s novel when involuntary memory acts “the same way as love does.”34The dream following this shock of recollection reveals to Marcel that he literally embodies that mutual predestination with his grandmother, which death seemed to have “effaced” forever.35<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Just‐war morality calls forth the virtue of self‐restraint in that it requires citizens, policy makers, and military personnel to situate the use of force within a wider set of moral (and global) goods. The practice of war is not an intrinsic good but should be ordered to the ends of peace and justice in the international arena. As ordained to such ends, war should have peace and justice as goods that are ingredient within its pursuits. For these reasons, just‐war tenets impose a kind of asceticism on public officials, combatants, and ordinary citizens. Self‐restraint is explicitly required by the
         ad bellumcriterion of last resort and thein bellolimits on the conduct of war, and it is implied by the more general fact that war must be pursued in the light of moral ends. That latter idea requires citizens to situate their patriotic allegiances within a wider framework of moral purposes. Patriotic statements about the need to defend one’s homeland, for example, must be chastened by reasonable appeals to moral ends that should inform our conduct and character.68The habits of patriotism and allegiance—important to political motivation, civic identity, and public action—must be disciplined by the attention to a nation’s wider aims, relationships, and responsibilities in the global common good. Just‐war morality thus involves a spiritual exercise, demanding politicians, military planners, and citizens to organize their attitudes and practices according to the demands of fairness—including fairness to Others whose interests may not be one’s own.<br>

Author(s): Schweiker William<br>
Abstract: This kind of humanism, we can say, encodes a specific way of seeing and evaluating the world, a mentality or sensibility, and thereby forms part of the structure of lived reality within which people dwell. Its hallmark is the creative self‐formation of human beings.
         16The best expression of this outlook, as often noted, is found in the Renaissance thinker Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. In his famousOration on the Dignity of Man, Pico depicts the deity speaking to human beings: “The nature of all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which We have laid down; you, by contrast, impeded by no such restriction, may, by your own free will, to whose custody We have assigned you, trace for yourself the lineaments of your own nature.”17Humanisticpaideiais nothing else, in this exalted form, than the formation of human “nature,” the core of which is the strangely wonderful and yet also vulnerable power of will. Human beings are subject to nothing beyond their kind, not even the divine, and the norm or measure of existence must arise within the will itself. Renaissance and modern humanism, in converse to much classical humanism, holds that the right orientation of human life is the creative exercise of power to shape one’s existence, rather than an ascent or unity with the “divine.” The modern vision of human existence thus linked an account of the good as finite flourishing with the drive to liberate human beings from ignorance and want.<br>

Abstract: The film object exists differently, or not at all, when kidnapped by consumers and sequestered on their computer desktops. Not only do individuals watch films on PCs at their leisure (stopping and starting at will, sampling chapters, and so on), they watch them on one window among several that may be running simultaneously (including those that hold email messages, the IMDb entry on the film, notes, a blog, and the current weather). Cinema constitutes just one kind of software content available to the powerful Windows operating system and the all‐encompassing PC hardware. Called up on demand or via YouTube, a movie appears on a flat panel, where many windows are displayed—as many as the user chooses, then shuffles, moving them around like cards in a game of solitaire.
         Monitoranddisplayseem more apt terms thanscreento designate the visual experience that computers deliver. The computer monitor of the twenty‐first century, just like thecinématographeof the nineteenth, presents the viewer with the present, with immediate attractions, no matter what is on display. Cinema, which ruled the twentieth century, pulls the viewer into another world and an encounter with something that has passed and is just out of reach.<br>

Abstract: This second, more normative dimension of Mrozik’s project opens up some challenging questions. If it is the case, as she suggests, that a sympathetic reading of the
   Compendium of Trainingcan provide valuable intellectual resources for contemporary ethical reflection, it remains unclear to me how our engagement with this text should proceed, given the significant disparities in cosmological assumptions (e.g., karmic causation and rebirth) and forms of practice that separate Mrozik’s contemporary readers from the text’s original audience. The text, moreover, appears less concerned with advancing particular truth claims than with creating a distinctive kind of religious subjectivity through ascetic and ritualized practice. Can we assess the value of the text’s ethical ideals apart from the forms of discipline and practice with which they were linked in medieval India? IfVirtuous Bodiesleaves such questions open to further exploration and analysis, its nuanced reading of theCompendium of Trainingbrings into sharper focus the centrality of human embodiment in South Asian Buddhist religious discourses and encourages us to reflect deeply on its implications for our own ethical inquiry.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 603531<br>
Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In conclusion, Coleridge testifies, in poetry and theological reflection alike, to an internal struggle constitutive of prayer and its language. Going back to the most recent philosophical discussions, this is not incompatible with Derrida’s insistence that the words of prayer are always inappropriate to the Other. Yet because Coleridgean prayer is a response, this struggle is entirely fitting: the call of God upon the subject is to open up the for‐God in one’s being, thus by definition practicing a kind of violence against one’s current being—including one’s speech. In
         Confessions of an Inquiring Spirit, Coleridge describes the name of God, the “I Am,” as part of a religious category called “stasis.” Prayer, however, is part ofmetastasis‐anastasis(change of state/rising up): the conflictual, dynamic, unfinished scene of human redemption that includes grace, love, hope, and perseverance.71Appropriately enough, the primary signification of metastasis is a transition between rhetorical figures. For Coleridge, there can be no transformation in one’s spiritual state unless the language in which one responds is also transformed, wrenched toward the improper. The heart of Coleridgean prayer is the metastasis between proper signification and catachresis that cuts against one’s language, one’s understanding, and hence one’s being in order to open oneself up to God. Perhaps one may even argue that in this cut, this wound, made against the “fleshly Understanding” (N6666, fol. 83), “the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26). This, certainly, is a hope on which much of his poetry and certainly his philosophy of prayer is founded.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: This kind of free exchange shows why promise does not accept the given without a critical reserve; it does not merely endorse political realities as it finds them. It does not introduce new immanent criteria for judging the political; rather, it, as Tillich indicated, opens possibility. The prophetic can provide an engine for addressing the construction of sovereignty as Schmitt has outlined it, as it seems to threaten human life; it can do so by endorsing political practices that are in fact otherwise than sovereign and that involve the establishment of free reciprocity and a field of exchange among equals without domination or debt. This seems to be the task that Tillich ascribes to the congregation: “The congregation should not take itself as a higher sociological form than other forms of community life, rather as a particular expression of the transcendental meaning of sociological forms … such a church that the social forms should elaborate their transcendental content‐meaning.”
         45The church, Tillich asserts, should be the place for this deliberation and anticipation. In short, he proposes the church as the site of promise.<br>

Abstract: The mode that is attributed to the Jew in Lévinas's essay is here called merely nomadic. It is nevertheless clear that the relationship between “man” and the “nomad” mirrors the relation of the anti-Semite to the Jew, as the “nomad” is presented as tied to technology and as such represents a threat to “man.” At the same time that it generalizes Lévinas's text, the opening of Blanchot's essay nonetheless manages to parallel the first paragraph of Lévinas's, even alluding obliquely to Heidegger's critique of flight in “Das Ding.” Within the body of the essay, Blanchot does take up specifically the category of the pagan, declaring that Gagarin's space flight is a threat to the pagan in all of us: he who is tied to enrootedness, to tradition, to his biological race, he who consoles himself among the trees over the evil of mankind. The Jew, however, is not mentioned. Even when Lévinas is paraphrased in the essay it is without specific citation, and he is referred to not as someone who speaks in the name of Judaism but as “the man with no fixed abode,” as a representative of the nomads (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 269). In repeating Lévinas, Blanchot has insisted on resisting the move back to the proper, which Lévinas's essay performs in its emphasis on Judaism's message. Lévinas uses Gagarin's flight to lead back to the truth of Judaism, concluding his own essay with the claim that, like technology, Judaism “has demystified the universe” and, moreover, “has discovered man in the nudity of the face” (“H,” p. 259; “HGU,” p. 234). Blanchot uses Lévinas's essay to remind us that Gagarin tears us away from the proper in
         every sense. His omission of both Lévinas's name and of Judaism underscores the point that deracination as a moral concept would prohibit reappropriation of any kind. The message of Gagarin's speech from space is for no one to claim and for no one to own, that is, that “truth is nomadic” (“C,” p. 13; “CS,” p. 271). Blanchot has thus doubly displaced Lévinas'~<br>

Abstract: However, while it could be argued that these similes function allegorically to show the loss of rational faculty to instinctual drives that explains the condition of the sinners in this circle, and while the similes do indeed describe the actions of the sinners, the vehicles in the similes are not just analogies. Rather, they function as microscopic views of the natural world of creatures and as part of the natural order of Dante's created universe: existing alone, they become sign, signified, and signifying, indifferent to humans or even to their place in the order of creatures; and, like all other creatures, in their immanent presence they perform and participate in a vast cosmic dance. Again, as Agamben puts it, describing animal captivation, the animal possesses a “more spellbinding and intense openness than any kind of human knowledge,” yet “it is closed in a total opacity.”
         62Animals—in this case, ants, fish, and birds—lacking consciousness of themselves as selves are captivated within themselves and by instinct and needs. This captivation, according to Agamben, following Heidegger, makes the world opaque to the nonhuman creature, yet this “captivation” also allows the animal to be “open” to the world, as vestige or footprint of a living divine presence. In this understanding of the ontology of the animal, we recognize that the animal is not in the postlapsarian human strife-ridden condition, trapped between being and nonbeing (consciousness and finitude). Rather, the animal exists in a state of obliviousness about the cares and anxieties that plague human consciousness. With the similes functioning heuristically, we then see the lustful inPurgatorio26, who are harnessing their recalcitrant desires, to aspire to this state possessed by nonhuman creatures and epitomized by the unconscious action of ants. In one sense the condition of the blessed, like that of the ants, is fullness of being, outside consciousness.<br>

Abstract: In book 10, Augustine starts out his reflections on remembrance—that lead up to the
      sero te amavi—by stating that memory and oblivion cancel each other out. Next, there follows a to and fro moving between partial memory and partial oblivion, just to culminate in the astonishing exclamation, thrice repeated, that this confessor has never forgotten his Confessee “since the day I learnt of you”:
            All of a sudden, the fact that memory and oblivion cancel each other out, after having been toned down in the rhetorical quest for truth from the viewpoint of partial memory and partial oblivion, looks like being restored to full glory. “Since the day I learnt of you I have never forgotten you.” All now depends on the precise meaning of this temporal notion “since the day” and of its enchanting repetition. What day? And what is the nature of temporality's intrusion in this passage into what seemed to be the “holy delights” of gently approaching truth and God? What kind of liaison with the preceding reflections, bent on ever-deepening interiority, is being maintained vis-à-vis the reintroduction of exteriority in the guise of theSee how widely I have ranged, Lord, searching for you in my memory. I have not found you outside it. For I have found nothing coming from you which I have not stored in my memory since the time I first learnt of you [
         ex quo didici te]. Since the day I learnt of you I have never forgotten you [nam ex quo didici te, non sum oblitus tui]. Where I discovered the truth, there I found my God, truth itself, which from the time I learnt it, I have not forgotten. And so, since the time I learnt of you, you remain in my consciousness [memory], and there I find you when I recall you and delight in you. These holy delights you have given me, in your mercy looking upon my poverty.

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: Due to the encyclopedic character of the work and the extensive range it covers, however, certain significant thinkers are often treated too quickly, whereas other, more marginal thinkers are treated too closely. This is particularly the case in his treatment of hermeneutics in the “pre-modern” period. For example, in chapter 6, entitled “From the Third Century to the Thirteenth Centuries,” he covers no fewer than twenty-four thinkers. At times, one feels flooded and inundated with a litany of references and historical facts, and it is easy to get confused as to the overall trajectory and purpose of the chapter and how it contributes to the formation and development of hermeneutics. The work would have been better served if it was more balanced and had devoted the same kind of sustained attention and precision to important “pre-modern” thinkers that it devoted to many key figures in modern and contemporary hermeneutics. In the same vein, in the rush to cover the history of hermeneutics, chapters are often oddly divided. For instance, the reader may be surprised to find the thought of Karl Barth lumped in together with structuralism and poststructuralism in a chapter loosely titled, “Some Mid-Twentieth Century Approaches.” It remains unclear as to why such disparate figures and strands of thought are gathered together into a single chapter, and it thus lacks the tightness and coherence of argument that it otherwise could have. If certain sections may glide over thinkers too quickly and other sections pay attention too closely, there are, despite the encyclopedic range of this book, certain gaps altogether in the history of hermeneutics that Thistleton offers. Thistleton himself concedes in his conclusion, for example, that there is insufficient attention paid particularly to Catholic biblical scholarship, which clearly indicates a way of introducing hermeneutics from a distinctly Protestant perspective. Any work that seeks to introduce a subject matter necessarily ma~<br>

Abstract: G. J. R., quoted in E. K. Chambers,
         The Elizabethan Stage, 4 vols. (Oxford University Press, 1923), 3:424. Chambers cites other rumors of the same kind, such as the incident to which Thomas Middleton referred in his 1604Black Bookwhen he attempted to describe someone's unruly coif: “he had a head of hair like one of my devils in Dr. Faustus when the old Theater cracked and frightened the audience” (424). Samuel Rowland also liked to say that Edward Alleyn would wear a cross on his surplice when he played Faustus for fear that he might be in the presence of devils.

Abstract: Finally, it remains unclear how the explicit commitment that I compared to
      prohairesisrelates to the nonreflective level at which commitment still operates in any particular direction of action, even in “letting oneself go in a flight of passion” (64). As I suggested, it seems that the “commitment” necessarily found in spontaneous or unreflective action or omission is no more than the weak endorsement of some reason implicit in any intention, including those of wantons and unwilling addicts. Arguably then, authenticity in actions involving no explicit practical reflection would depend on their being guided by the deeper kind of commitment formed by explicit avowals, in which the more generic type of commitment is made “one’s own” in the deeper sense.<br>

Author(s): LaCocque André<br>
Abstract: This observation reveals some divergence between the biblical answer to Babel and the more universal discussion of LaCocque’s analysis. The critique of Babel’s hubris leads to the covenant of Genesis 12, the “great exception, the miraculous ‘otherness’ that is both judgment and relief for ‘all the families of the earth’” (100). But questions remain. For J, the answer to the loss of innocence in Eden and Babel is the covenant, but in LaCocque’s reading, the text affirms rather the indeterminacy and perennial suspicion of structure more characteristic of postmodern thinkers. In his reading, the tower claims a presence, but “deconstructionism shows the absence of such absolute presence” (154). Such a reading is justified in part by the fact that “authorial intent never exhausts the text’s meanings” (93). While there may be little to regret over the deterioration of Babel’s collapse, the same kind of deconstructive move could be made against the theology of J. The understated theologies of J and LaCocque run suggestively through
      The Captivity of Innocence, but much more could be said about them and how they are related.<br>

Abstract: As is often the case, when a scholar who is trained as a descriptivist (in disciplines such as history, sociology, and ethnography) attempts to take on theoretical issues they become theoretically parochial. They understand what works for their predefined area of expertise. However, theory takes place in constituting the domains for research, prior to the act of description, not in the applying individual concepts to preexistent object-domains. As Paul Ricoeur put it, “to delimit a domain of application is a hermeneutical act,” an act “that calls for reflection in terms of a general theory of interpretation” (
      Figuring the Sacred[Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1995] 304). This kind of reflection, in my view as a scholar trained in theory, is completely lacking in Vásquez’s choice of criterion, despite his long sections of exegesis of theoretical texts. Rigorous exegesis is not the same thing as rigorous theoretical thinking. Rather, in Vásquez’s choices we find a predetermined view in search of a theory. The book becomes a justification of his choices, not a critical, reflexive, hermeneutical act. Theory happens before the explication of theory begins, and awareness of this fact is absent from this text.<br>

Abstract: For example, a common view which finds expression among traditional and modern exegetes alike is that impurity symbolizes death.
            
                  Proponents of this theory point to the explicit connections between the skin disease17
               ṣaraʿat(conventionally translated “leprosy”) and references to death (Numbers 12:12) and mourning (Leviticus 13:45–46). These scholars also construe menstrual impurity (Leviticus 15:19–24) as stemming from the loss of life-fluid and for constituting a period of infertility. Unfortunately, this view is ill-equipped to explain why sexual relations defile (Leviticus 15:18),
                  notwithstanding the counter-intuitive claim that the loss of seed (even in coitus) is a kind of death.18
               
                  These theories suffer from the endemic weakness of Aristotle’s theory of categorization: any exceptional case undermines the assumption that category membership is defined by fixed criteria.19<br>

Abstract: Some of the earliest forms of the generic notion of evil demarcate
            abominations—acts that, like incest, cannibalism, patricide—elicit horror and disgust. Abominations are violations, disorders of nature that issue in natural sanctions: plagues or expulsions. The world in whichevilis construed as a form ofsinful disobedienceis a world defined by a divinity who gives commands, exacts obedience, punishes, or rewards (Genesis and Exodus). A world focused on virtue andviceis a naturalistic, social world (Theophrastus, Butler, Mandeville). Virtues are those traits that—like courage and justice—preserve and enhance a community. The vices—greed, disloyalty, envy, self-indulgence, disrespect—threaten the social order. The origins and sanctions for vices are social: an unfortunate upbringing in a malformed polity can issue in the kind of corruption whose sanction is the loss of trust and cooperation. Withmalevolence(Pope Innocent III, Calvin), we enter a new world, a world of individual will and responsibility. While malevolence is normally marked by a defective will,sinfuses disobedience with a defiant will (Aquinas, Jonathan Edwards). But while the earliest forms of disobedience can be relatively innocent, sin presupposes that Everyman, in the full knowledge of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, willfully violates the divine order by presumptuous pride (Milton’s Satan, Goethe’s Faust). When the disposition or proclivity to sin—construed as pride or egoism—becomes an inherently dominant and psychologically structuring motive, only divine grace can set aside divine punishment. Evil becomes less fraught when morality returns to the secular, social order during the Renaissance and Enlightenment. Setting aside the theology and metaphysics of sin, the new psychology turned to characterizing character traits that—like wanton cruelty—generate “man’s inhumanity to man” (Montaigne, Voltaire).Partiality, egoism—the desire for glory or selfinterest—remai~<br>

Author(s): Fisher Cass<br>
Abstract: Cass Fisher has set for himself a noble goal: “to reframe the debate about the role of theology in Judaism and Jewish studies by proposing a new model for understanding Jewish theological language” (2). The impetus for this project is the awareness that although the discipline of Jewish studies has thrived in the past half century, theology is still marginal because of the mistaken perception that “there is no Jewish theology” (3) or that “Judaism has produced the wrong kind of theology” (4). Fisher correctly and persuasively argues that such perception not only is historically incorrect but also ignores a thriving “post-Holocaust theology, feminist theology, exegetical theology, and covenantal theology” (3), a list that could have included environmental theology. To appreciate the degree to which theological thinking is central to Judaism, a new and more appropriate understanding of theology is in order. Theology is not to be reduced to propositional speculations about God but should rather be understood as belief-forming activities that are an integral part of Jewish religious practice, including exegesis, hermeneutics, rational discourse on divine perfection, and religious experience.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673367<br>
Date: 02 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Lehnhof Kent R.<br>
Abstract: While it might seem like the worst kind of bardolatry to say that Shakespearean criticism could or should follow Levinas’s Talmudic pattern, I am nonetheless attracted to a hermeneutic that favors renewal over resolution. Such an approach would oppose an analytic order that tries to contract a plenitude of responses into a handful of “right” readings and that tramples individuality underfoot in its expectation that all informed readers and audience members respond alike. Such an approach would recognize that agreement and unicity can dry up the wellsprings of meaning and significance and would embrace instead the unsettling effects of multiplicity and plurality, which do not appease us with a self-satisfying sense of knowledge but send us back to the text, obsessed and enthralled. Such an approach would begin to resemble what Simon Critchley, in a slightly different context, calls “dissensual emancipatory praxis”: a relentless disturbing of the idyll of consensus, not to do away with consensus (or criticism) but to bring about its endless betterment.
      
            The ethical possibilities toward which Levinas directs us (if only indirectly) are to be realized in a literary criticism that does not thematize but throws open, upsetting our apprehension in such a way as to reaffirm the richness of the text and the range and depth of responses it can draw forth. This kind of criticism would not be defined by dogmatism but would depend instead upon the incessant questioning of all: the disciple as well as the master. This criticism would strive to keep our responsiveness from rigidifying into a stultifying totality. It would aim at something akin to “the permanent renewal of the text through the intelligence.”63<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 673750<br>
Date: 08 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Hequembourg Stephen<br>
Abstract: But what about the poet who also speaks these words? Does he too desire to lose himself completely in that original utterance? Fish’s claim asks us to consider the contradictory nature of “originality” in Milton’s work. On the one hand, it signifies all that Milton does when he boldly rewrites the epic tradition, pursuing “things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.” On the other hand, it means what Fish describes, something perilously close to “unoriginality”—the act of reiterating the words of another, until the quotation marks fall away and the speaker disappears entirely into what is spoken. It is a contrast we can register visually when we look at some of George Herbert’s poems. What we often see is a short italicized scriptural phrase (
      My God, my King; Thou art still my God) that the speaker wishes desperately he could just repeat—to quote without embellishment. But these little quotations are always embellished, surrounded by a kind of permanent poetic scaffolding. In the same way, Milton’s voice cannot finally be identified either with his “lovely enchanting language” or with those pure scriptural words that he wishes he could repeat, simply and selflessly.
               The divine poet is pulled back and forth between the work of creation and the work of quotation, drawing poetry out of the impossible desire to be at once innovative and inspiredly unoriginal.45<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>
Date: 10 01, 2014<br>
Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Few have experienced the consequences of religion being used by the political order as a tool to mobilize forces for its agendas more acutely than Bonhoeffer. Bethge, his closest friend to whom most prison letters were addressed, asks rhetorically, “Is there not concealed behind our religious trends our ungovernable urge toward … power—in the name of God to do what
         wewant, and in the name of the Christian worldview to stir up and play people against one another?”
               Those immersed in the forms of religion that legitimate their own culture are particularly susceptible to ignorance regarding the deep connection between religion and the will to power. Unlike religious institutions (in the Bonhoefferian sense), the church that is rooted in Jesus’s being for others has the potential to offer the world a vision that relativizes all social orders.155
            
               Commenting on Matt. 7:21, where Jesus says, “Not all who say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven,” Bonhoeffer warns against “a kind of confession of Christ that Jesus rejects because it is in contradiction with doing the will of God.”156
            
               Jesus rejects such a confession, Bonhoeffer, explains, “because it arises out of our own human knowledge of good and evil.”157
            
               Therefore, the ecclesia must always remain aware of the danger consisting in a religious dogmatism that equips the believer with the categories of good and evil without incorporating personal relation with God as the measure against which his or her life is to be discerned.158

Abstract: The second two qualities of metaphor important to early modern tragedy’s use of the figure pertain to the effects of this conceptual reorganization on the audience. Many theorists of metaphor describe the figure as “provoking,” “inviting,” or “asking” something of the audience.
      
            Thus, the third notable quality of metaphor is its function as, in the words of Ted Cohen, an “intimate” figure that forges a community by initiating a “cooperative act of comprehension.” Cohen argues that metaphor, as a special type of speech, emphasizes a process present but generally unstated in all communication: “Three aspects are involved: (1) the speaker issues a kind of concealed invitation; (2) the hearer expends a special effort to accept the invitation; and (3) this transaction constitutes the acknowledgment of a community.”15
         
            In doing the work of deciphering the relationship between tenor and vehicle, the strange and the familiar, audiences become part of an interpretive community, both drawn into the interpretation intended by the maker of the metaphor and participating in the creation of new knowledge formulated through the metaphoric conjunction. If the metaphor is accepted, and thus both the tenor and vehicle are “modified” in the process, the poet and the audience have been carried by the metaphor into a new discursive community. In the tragic theater’s metaphors of pain, this process paves the way for further audience engagement with the play in the forms of empathy for the characters and potential adoption of a new worldview.16

Abstract: Analogy or proportion is when the second term is to the first as the fourth to the third. We may then use the fourth for the second, or the second for the fourth. Sometimes too we qualify the metaphor by adding the term to which the proper word is relative. Thus the cup is to Dionysus as the shield to Ares. The cup may, therefore, be called “the shield of Dionysus”, and the shield “the cup of Ares”. Or, again, as old age is to life, so is evening to day. Evening may therefore be called, “the old age of the day” and old age, “the evening of life”, or, in the phrase of Empedocles, “life’s setting sun”. For some of the terms of the proportion there is at times no word in existence; still the metaphor may be used. For instance, to scatter seed is called sowing: but the action of the sun in scattering his rays is nameless. Still this process bears to the sun the same relation as sowing to the seed. Hence the expression of the poet “sowing the god-created light”. There is another way in which this kind of metaphor may be employed. We may apply an alien term, and then deny of that term one of its proper attributes; as if we were to call the shield, not “the cup of Ares” but “the wineless cup”. (

Article Title: Poetics of Conspiracy and Hermeneutics of Suspicion in Tacitus's<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: ca.2013.32.issue-1<br>
Date: 04 2013<br>
Abstract: This article argues that the end of Tacitus's
         Dialogus de Oratoribusis inconclusive in ways that draw attention to the difficulty of interpretation not onlyofthe dialogue, as by modern scholars, but alsointhe dialogue, as by its leading characters. The inconclusiveness is especially marked by a commonly noted, but little discussed, feature of the end: when the rest of the characters laugh at the point of departure, Tacitus himself does not. Arguing that this difference of affective response on the part of the characters prefigures differences in interpretive response on the part of readers, the article identifies different strains in recent scholarship: pessimistic and optimistic. Both forms of response entail an attribution of a “poetics of conspiracy” (Hinds) to the ultimate speaker of the dialogue, the author Tacitus, and a “hermeneutics of suspicion” (Ricoeur) to its reader. At the same time, the author's double-position, as character and author, between narrated event and narration of the event to the reader, suggests that the other characters in the dialogue may, like the author and reader, also exercise such poetics and hermeneutics on one another and themselves. The article ends with thecomparandumof the first satire of Tacitus's near contemporary, Juvenal, suggesting that, in the case of these works that can look with hindsight on the social and political past of the Early Empire, their modes of transmission and reception may be politically determined (e.g., as conspiratorial, suspicious) but may also demonstrate, within the restrictions of social and political determinations, a high degree of contingency, reflexivity, and autonomy. Such possibilities suggest that the text itself is part of a pragmatic and performative tradition of the kind enacted by its characters, in addition to a tradition of the production of (comparatively static and unfree) “literary” works.<br>

Abstract: Architectural historian William Jordy, who wrote his seminal
      American Buildings and Their Architects: Progressive and Academic Ideals at the Turn of the Twentieth Centurysoon after the restoration had been completed, discussed the building in similar terms. He acknowledged a number of remarkably dramatic effects achieved in Maybeck's project. He mentioned the popular devotion to the palace that had saved it from demolition, stating that an affection of this kind was a high compliment to the architect's talent. However, Jordy concluded by contrasting the palace's dreamlike architecture with the principles of earnest design, more appropriate for a piece of permanent architecture.
               He used "scenographic" and "eccentricity" as derogatory terms, and made it plain that stage set design should not be confused with "real architecture."27
            
               In short, he concurred with the view that the preservation of the palace went against major principles of the profession.28<br>

Abstract: In chapter three, “Temporality,” Wu deploys Paul Ricoeur’s concepts of time as an analytical tool to great advantage.
      
            Wu writes that images within the tomb such as star maps and animals associated with the cardinal directions align the deceased with the underlying structure of the cosmos in what Ricoeur would call “cosmic time.” In contrast, personal objects buried with the dead represent a “lived time.” These embody two different forms of time: at the funeral they evoke the past life of the deceased, but once buried in a tomb they cater to the needs of the soul in the present and future. A third kind of time, “historical time,” represented by textual and pictorial biographies of the deceased and narratives of important historical figures, reconstructs his or her public persona. And finally, the frequent depiction of chariots on tomb walls represents a journey that enables the deceased to move through time within the tomb.1<br>

Article Title: The Formation of Identity: The Importance of Ideals<br>
Publisher: Carfax Publishing<br>
Issue: i243292<br>
Date: 12 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Thompson Jim<br>
Abstract: In the formation and composition of what might be termed personal identity a key but often neglected aspect is ideal identity. While comprising aspirations rather than realities, it makes a major contribution to the definition of self-identity. It does this as a result of: (a) clarifying what kind of person the individual wishes to be; and (b) an interrogation of how she sets about achieving her ideal identity, intimating what kind of person she is at a particular moment by virtue of the way in which she strives to achieve her ideal. The article argues for a re-appraisal of the notion of ideals in education and for its reinstatement as a significant feature of education. Indeed, we argue, children cannot avoid ideals--they are presented to them everyday from a wide variety of sources. But these sources or the ideals that they promote are not necessarily good for the child's well-being or for her fellow citizens. Consequently, teachers as moral agents have an important role in assisting children to acquire ideals that do meet such a criterion of goodness in addition to helping them reflect critically on the range of ideals they may encounter in their communities and society.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249760<br>
Date: 7 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): Young Aaron<br>
Abstract: Postmodern theory is often seen as a realm either of totally free play--where anything goes and there are no rules at all--or of despair where all visions of equality and democracy are equated with totalitarianism. Coherent ways of talking about "actors" or "responsibility" can appear to be entirely repudiated. Further perceived as elitist, obscure, convoluted, and entirely removed from any kind of practical reality, postmodernism is often viewed as having nothing relevant to say to teachers or those interested in concretely improving education. This paper attempts to show that these visions are not entirely fair to the ways many "postmodern" theorists strive to explore carefully the myriad tensions invariably involved in politics and pedagogy or to the (perhaps surprising) egalitarian commitments that generally undergird their projects. Taking advantage of the fluid and ultimately undefinable character of the idea of the "postmodern," this paper draws from an eclectic group of thinkers, teasing out a range of different perspectives that might inform, complicate, and contest efforts to "teach freedom."<br>

Abstract: Recent study of the nature of textuality as such opens new insights for the study of the Bible. Although individual parts of the Bible have oral antecedents, the Bible as a whole has existed only as a text, and a unique kind of text, folded back on itself out of communal memory as no other book has been. A text is a monument. Textuality establishes a special relationship between discourse and death. Spoken words are exchanges between living persons. The text presents its message as well if its author is dead as it does if he or she is alive. Print is even more bound to death than writing is. In comparison with oral performance-delivery of an oration, song-a text physically has certain special alliances with past time. All texts come out of the past. Literature as text is psychologically retrospective: its effects typically include an element of nostalgia. Because of its future orientation, culminating in the closing words of Revelation, "Come, Lord Jesus" (as against typical narrative closes such as "They lived happily ever after"), the Bible has an unusual relationship to textuality: it is not literature in the way other texts are. Typical narrative plot structures existence retrospectively: the story is organized back from the conclusion. This retrospective organization is maximized by writing, which tightens plot and makes more of re-cognition, a kind of return to the beginning (the past) and hence a cyclic pattern. In addition to being related intimately to death, writing and print are also limitlessly fecund, the central forces in the evolution of consciousness, once they appear. The fecundity of writing and print, like other fecundity in human existence, is achieved by passage through death. "Unless the grain of wheat dies." The Word of God in the Person of Jesus Christ is conceived of by analogy with the spoken word. The Father speaks the Word, the Son (eo verbum quo filius); he does not write the Word, who would then by biblical attestation be not life but d~<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i303121<br>
Date: 7 1, 1984<br>
Author(s): Wellbery Adam<br>
Abstract: The essay studies the ways in which death-the word, the concept, and the friction between word and concept-informs aesthetic programs of Lessing and Burke. Both writers turn (and return often) to death as a kind of artistic touchstone and, in doing so, illustrate divergent schools of Enlightenment aesthetic thought. Lessing wants to define and maintain, if only conceptually and only pragmatically, the borders between spatial and temporal representation; Burke, to collapse the borders between space and time, if only imaginatively and momentarily. Lessing, in both the Laokoon and How the Ancients Represented Death, although nervous about the slipperiness of the word death, seems to embrace death's certainty; it is an end, the end, the limit to end all limits. Burke, on the other hand, treats death as "the king of terrors"; he opens himself, at least nominally, to the "obscurity" of death, to the possibility of the infinite. Beneath the surface, though, Burke is profoundly ambivalent about giving up finite, spatialized representation in favor of a potentially infinite temporal flow, and his treatment of Milton's "universe of death" is a fascinating study in this ambivalence. This essay closely studies the tropes-blindness, for instance-with which Lessing and Burke approach death and suggests that their strategies are at root more similar than may appear.

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of how to give historical explanations of scientist's decisions to prefer one theory over another. It is argued that such explanations ought to contain only statements about the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved, and, in particular, ought not to include evaluative premises about the theories themselves. It is argued that Lakatos's attempt to build into such historical explanations premises of an evaluative kind is deficient. The arguments of Laudan to the effect that such explanations depend crucially upon evaluative assumptions about the rationality or irrationality of decisions are examined. It is argued that they do not establish the need for such assumptions. Similar criticisms are then shown to be applicable to a version of the 'hermeneutical' model of explanation for human actions.<br>

Abstract: ¿Cómo estudiar las experiencias sociales cuyas demandas escapan de los canales político-institucionales? Para llevar adelante este tipo de investigaciones, se encuentran coordenadas interesantes en el estudio del proceso sociopolítico y la subpolítica. Se desarrollan los niveles y las dimensiones con las que identificar e indagar lo sociopolítico. Así, aludimos tanto a las emociones como a los recursos culturales y simbólicos con los que construimos un modelo de análisis para dichas investigaciones. Esta perspectiva compara las maneras de explicar la aparición de las experiencias sociales a partir de la espontaneidad. El "cacerolazo" y las asambleas barriales ocurridos en la Argentina se constituyen en la experiencia social a partir de la cual poder reflexionar sobre tales cuestiones. /// How to study social experiences whose demands do not run through the political institutional channels? So as to put forward this kind of research, there are available interesting coordinates in the socio-political process and subpolitics. Levels and dimensions with which to identify and probe into the socio-political are developed. So, we refer both to the emotions as well as to the cultural and symbolic resources with which we construct a model of analysis to carry out such research. This approach confronts the ways to explain the emergence of social experiences taking spontaneity as a point of departure. The "cacerolazo" and the asambleas barriales which took place in Argentina make up the social experience from which we can reflect on such questions.<br>

Publisher: The Johns Hopkins University Press<br>
Issue: i20486733<br>
Date: 2 1, 2009<br>
Author(s): Addis Adeno<br>
Abstract: The assertion of prescriptive and adjudicative universal jurisdictions by some countries in relation to a handful of offenses that are classified as international or universal crimes (e.g. genocide) has led to a great deal of controversy. Those who favor universal jurisdiction argue that certain acts (often crimes) affect all of us, not just the specific individual or group of victims or the country of which the victims are nationals. It is therefore legitimate, they argue, for any state to punish or suppress such acts regardless of any traditional jurisdictional connection between the alleged acts and the state asserting jurisdiction. The availability of universal jurisdiction is premised on the presumed effect of certain crimes on humanity as a whole. Those who commit these offenses are referred to as hostis humani generis--enemies of human kind. Skeptics argue that the idea of universal jurisdiction is conceptually incoherent, inconsistent with the principle of political self-determination, and has great potential to be an instrument of political mischief. While they disagree on the conceptual coherence and utility of the notion of universal jurisdiction, both proponents and opponents view its function in purely instrumental terms, to provide the condition for punishing or suppressing certain offenses that affect all of us. This article argues that universal jurisdiction also serves another, less articulated purpose. It has a constitutive function as well. It is partly a process through which the identity of the international community is imagined and enacted. It is an expression of a sense of ourselves (a community of humankind) at given moments of time. This article argues that neglect of this constitutive dimension leads to an incomplete analysis of universal jurisdiction.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri~<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se estudian las memorias sobre 1968 en el espacio público mexicano en los últimos cuarenta años. Si desde 1969 se puede ubicar una memoria de denuncia de la represión asociada al 2 de octubre, es sólo a mediados de los años ochenta que puede localizarse una memoria de elogio del movimiento estudiantil en su conjunto que considera que buscó abrir cauces hacia la democratización del país. El artículo analiza en qué presente se narra, se recuerda, y cuál es el pasado recuperado; para ello las memorias públicas son historizadas desde los distintos presentes políticos desde los cuales son enunciadas. This article studies the memories in the Mexican public space over the past forty years. Although it of 1968 is possible to find a memory of the denunciation of repression associated with October 2 since 1969, it is only from the mid-1980s that we can locate a memory of praise of the student movement as a whole, since it is considered to have paved the way for democratization of the country. The article analyzes what present narratives are enunciated and events recalled, and what kind of past is recovered. Whit this purpose public memories are historicized from the various political presents from which they are expressed.<br>

Abstract: The basic matrix of concepts of the modern mind was largely formed during the English, French and German Enlightenments, as they built upon the legacy of Descartes. After asking why a new philosophic outlook was needed, the paper turns to its wide acceptance as differently manifested in the three divergent Enlightenments. From Hobbes to Kant, we see the root of the ideas that form the contemporary mind. Distinguishing these from each other, as well as the movements within the French Enlightenment, the paper concludes noting the good and bad that emerged. It calls for a fidelity to the western intellectual tradition which, uniquely, produced the kind of free social order that makes reconciliation of divergent cultural values possible.<br>

Abstract: This article reviews some new international releases in the field of discourse analysis in the tradition of Michel FOUCAULT. This kind of Foucauldian discourse analysis is related to other forms in the wider interdisciplinary field of discourse analysis. Nonetheless, it can be demonstrated that the Foucauldian form of discourse analysis is the most relevant one for contemporary analysis in the social sciences. It is argued that in the German social sciences the term "discourse analysis" is primarily used for theoretical social research or is used for empirical social research, without disclosing discourse-analytic methodology. Since the 1990s, the development of empirical methodologies for social discourse analysis in Germany has intensified. From it's beginning in the late 1960s, French methodology of discourse analysis has been empirically orientated. Here, the work of Michel PÊCHEUX is the central influence in which the epistemology of discourse analysis is thoroughly discussed and theorized. In France, PÊCHEUX continued the work of Michel FOUCAULT and, since then, one can speak of a Foucauldian tradition of discourse analysis, namely "French Discourse Analysis" (FDA). This review outlines the state-of- the-art of the transformation of Foucauldian discourse theory into a discourse-analytic methodology as a new kind of qualitative social research. For this reason, the influence and the analytic tools of linguistics are critically reviewed and a comparison of FDA in France and Foucauldian discourse analysis in Germany is undertaken. The first book reviewed is a British monograph from Glyn WILLIAMS that describes the development of French discourse analysis in the context of structuralism and post-structuralism. The book contains a thorough update of French discourse analysis and is path breaking for German readers of the discourse-analytic work of Michel PÊCHEUX. The volume comes on the heels of a new German handbook of social discourse analysis (edited by KELLER; ~<br>

Article Title: The Making of a Social Theory: Anthony Giddens' Theory of Structuration<br>
Publisher: North Central Sociological Association<br>
Issue: i20831390<br>
Date: 4 1, 1986<br>
Author(s): Dickie-Clark Hamish F.<br>
Abstract: In this paper I try to show what kind of theory Giddens' theory of structuration is. I do so by first listing what Giddens accepts and what he rejects in his assessments of functionalism, hermeneutics, structuralism, and the writings of Marx. For what I think are good reasons, most of this part is given over to the use Giddens makes of Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy. Next I set out my understanding of Giddens' view of theory as primarily concerned "with reworking conceptions of human being and human doing, social reproduction and social transformation" (Giddens 1984:xx). I seek to show the crucial implications of this for the way that theory enters directly into and helps to consitute social life. Taken together, these two steps lead to the conclusion that Giddens' theory is neither an attempt at an over-arching "Grand Theory," nor an imposition of new orthodoxy in place of the old. Instead I suggest that his avowed eclecticism is closely akin to the hermeneutic goal contained in Gadamer's concept of the "fusion of horizons." This notion recognizes the never-to-be-completed, but basic, human activity of creatively questioning what has been handed down from the past. It is questioned so that it may be applied — incomplete as it is — to the changed situation of the present with its different interests and problems. That those who can and do question it are themselves the products of past tradition, calls for a kind of social theory that is in some ways different from that modeled on the explanatory "laws" of natural science. I contend that Giddens' theory of structuration is such a theory. (For an introductory overview of the theory itself, see Dickie-Clark, 1984).<br>

Publisher: Giannini Editore<br>
Issue: i23335068<br>
Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Wolfe Charles T.<br>
Abstract: The category "organism" has an ambiguous status: is it scientific or is it philosophical? Or, if one looks at it from within the relatively recent field or sub-field of philosophy of biology, is it a central, or at least legitimate category therein, or should it be dispensed with? In any case, it has long served as a kind of scientific bolstering for a philosophical train of argument which seeks to refute the mechanistic or reductionist trend, which has been perceived as dominant since the 17th century, whether in the case of Stahlian animism, Leibnizian monadology, the neo-vitalism of Hans Driesch, or, lastly, of the "phenomenology of organic life" in the 20th century, with authors such as Kurt Goldstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Georges Canguilhem. In this paper I try to reconstruct some of the main interpretive stages or layers of the concept of organism in order to evaluate it critically. How might organism be a useful concept if one rules out the excesses of organismic biology and metaphysics? Varieties of instrumentalism and what I call the projective concept of organism are appealing, but perhaps ultimately unsatisfying.<br>

Issue: i23359698<br>

Author(s): Stern David<br>
Abstract: This article considers the function of the mashal (parable) in Rabbinic literature and the connection between the use to which the mashal is put in that literature and the literary form it takes. Following a consideration of the contexts, narrative and exegetical, in which the mashal appears in midrashic and talmudic literature, three disctinct models for the form are proposed: (1) As a didactic tool, whose form is exoteric and relies largely on figurative language that illustrates the ideas the parable teaches. (2) As an instrument of sectarian doctrine, often esoteric in its form, and one which closely resembles allegory and seeks to disguise its message if not to hide it. (3) As a homiletical device with the form of an allusive tale told for an ulterior purpose, in order to persuade its audience of a certain inexplicit message. The article suggests that the mashal in Rabbinic literature generally falls into the third category, and that the messages it seeks to persuade are mainly on the order of praise or blame (or a subtype of praise or blame, like apologetics, polemics, eulogy, or complaint). Examples of meshalim for several of these categories are briefly discussed. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the meshal found in Lamentations Rabba 3, 21. This is a praise-mashal whose narrative also suggests a certain kind of blame and, in effect, allows the mashal to be read in two ways. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that the rhetorical richness of the mashal derives in part from the tension between the mashal's function and its narrative complexity, and that the popularity of the form was a result of the fact that the use of narrative in the mashal allowed the Rabbis to express certain feelings and attitudes that other, more prosaic, midrashic literary forms could not convey.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1997<br>
Author(s): ALBINUS LARS<br>
Abstract: The aim is to show how formations of discourse can be seen as the subject matter for the historian of religions, drawing on structuralist and hermeneutic approaches. Although these may differ on important theoretical and methodological issues, I find the way in which they correspond, namely by pointing to the topic of discourse as their field of investigation, even more important. In this article a discourse is understood as a framework of communication, and the focus is laid upon religious discourse as a special kind of authorization. In ancient Greece, for example, "authors" such as Homer and Orpheus were the authorities of two different discursive traditions. The analysis of discourse can present us with a view of how certain frames of communication were interacting by means of contest, and how, eventually, it was the very strategy of authorization that was contested. Hence, what has often been seen as a paradigmatic shift from mythos to logos could more fruitfully be viewed from a discursive angle than from a perspective of different mentalities. Discourse analysis, as presented in this article, is a way of coming to terms with the process of transformation by regarding dynamic properties of communication, that is, as interrelated strategies on connected levels of system and event.<br>

Abstract: THIS ESSAY EXAMINES THE RELEVANCE FOR RELIGIOUS ETHICS OF BUDDHIST Abhidhamma texts, those dealing with the analysis and systematization of mental states arising in and examined by meditation practice. Developing recent scholarship on the prevalence and significance of interlocking lists in Buddhist canonical texts and commentaries, the Buddhist use of lists in the Abhidhamma constitutes a kind of narrative expression of moral development through the sequential occurrence of carefully defined mental states. Attention to this narrative dimension of the moral life, while related to other recent proposals about the place of narrative in religious ethics, offers a way to employ this underexamined genre of religious literature (lists) drawn from a comparative context (Buddhist and Christian ethics), in service of a more nuanced account of moral development.<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: The Bacchae by Euripides can be read as a heuristic laboratory for the transfer between the Greek "tragic" and the Christian "metatragic", since Euripides distances himself from the unstilled myth of the tragic which consits of Dionysian versus Apollinian duality. What is being sought is a new metatragic hermeneutics, which can only be found in the Chalcedonian relationship between "undivided and unmixed representation", since it is only in a Christologically substantiated statement the wish is actually (and not only seemingly) fulfilled that "Dionysos speaks the language of Apollo, and Apollo, finally, the language of Dionysos" (Nietzsche). This new kind of metatragic hermeneutics, whose substructures are denoted as "mysterium" and "metaphor", is attained by the poetic reinterpretation of the death of "Pentheus", who now becomes a type of Christus Patiens.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author presents an analogy between the representation (...) of Jesus mentioned in the words of institution of the Eucharist and the hermeneutic concept of the gospels. Based on a "hermeneutics of representation," the former can be described as sacramental representation, the latter as narrative representation of Jesus. This is exemplified by selected passages from the gospels which reveal this concept of representation. A hermeneutical approach of this kind can at least help to overcome the distinction between the "historical Jesus" and the "Christ of faith."<br>

Abstract: En este ensayo se presenta un balance de la historiografía mexicana del siglo XX, tomando como eje el tránsito de su "institucionalización" a su "profesionalización". Se dibujan asimismo las tendencias teórico-metodológicas dominantes y se da cuenta, en la última parte del escrito, de las modificaciones recientes: 1) el tránsito de una historia de las mentalidades a una historia cultural y, 2) de una historia cifrada alrededor de los métodos de las ciencias políticas y sociales, a otra en la que se reconoce una especie de retorno de las humanidades o ciencias de la cultura y de los comportamientos humanos a la historia. This paper offers an assessment of Mexican historiography during the 20th century, centering on the transition from its "institutionalization" to its "professionalization". It also outlines the dominant theoretical-methodological trends and, towards its end, sheds light upon recent changes: 1) the transition from a history of mentalities to a cultural history, and 2) from a history encoded around the methods of political and social sciences to another in which one recognizes a kind of return to history of humanities or cultural sciences and of human behaviors.<br>

Abstract: Recent desistance research has emphasized the importance of shifts in offenders' identities to explain cessation from crime. Explanatory weight is given to how the agent reflects and acts upon relevant social circumstances rather than seeing desistance as the product of greater control exerted by the obligations of new roles. This kind of self-reflexivity is achieved through an internal moral conversation that is often couched in terms of agents' ultimate concerns and their relationship with others. In so doing, desisters fashion a narrative identity, which acknowledges yet disclaims past actions and commits them to an ideal future self.<br>

Abstract: Diese ist Kernpunkt des Individuationsprozesses. Hier müßte im Grunde versucht werden,
die Archetypenlehre C. G. Jungs gleichsam auf die Entwicklung des kindlichen Individuations-
prozesses extrapolierend klarzustellen. Begreift man aber Religiosität sowieso - wie hier versucht
- als Prozeß innerhalb der Individuation von Erwachsenem und Kind, so wird die Religiosität des
Kindes - sei es nun archetypisch fundiert oder nicht - in seiner formalen Genese verständlich.

Abstract: Lochrie, p. 128: "By definition, abjection is an ordeal of the self in which 'nothing is familiar.'
It is experienced as a kind of fear and revulsion precipitated by the loss of boundaries of the
subject. The 'I' finds itself 'ceaselessly straying' in 'unstable territories.' The abject is that which
'does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite.'"
Kristeva, Pouvoirs de l'horreur, pp. 12-13: "S'il est vrai que l'abject sollicite et pulvérise tout à la
fois le sujet, on comprend qu'il s'éprouve dans sa force maximale lorsque, las de ses vaines
tentatives de se reconnaître hors de soi, le sujet trouve l'impossible en lui-même: lorsqu'il trouve
que l'impossible, c'est son être même, découvrant qu'il n'est autre qu'abject. L'abjection de soi
serait la forme culminante de cette expérience du sujet auquel est dévoilé que tous ses objets ne
reposent que sur la perte inaugurale fondant son être propre. Rien de tel que l'abjection de soi
pour démontrer que toute abjection est en fait reconnaissance du manque fondateur de tout être,
sens, langage, désir.... La chrétienté mystique a fait de cette abjection de soi la preuve ultime de
l'humilité devant Dieu, comme en témoigne cette sainte Elisabeth, qui 'toute grande princesse
qu'elle estoit, aymait sur tout l'abjection de soy-mesme.'"<br>

Abstract: Faith is characterized by an unsolvable problem of justification. While St. Paul concludes the truth of the faith from the practice (cf. 1. Thess 2,13), the Evangelists quote Jesus Christ as important witness (cf. Mk 1,1–3), who bears witness to himself in a decisive moment (cf. Joh 8,12–20). Who legitimates the omniscient narrator of these christological confessions? By means of Genette's narrative theory and the hermeneutic theories of Bultmann and Fuchs, the specific demand which faith puts onto the human being, becomes apparent: the auctorial narrative form frees the fundamental narrations of faith from any kind of human justification, thus marking the special credibility which is inherent to listening to God's words.<br>

Author(s): ATKINS KIM<br>
Abstract: In his famous paper, What Is It Like To Be A Bat?, Thomas Nagel argues against a reductive physicalist account of consciousness by highlighting what he calls "the subjective character of experience". In this paper I will argue that Nagel's insight is important for understanding the value placed on patient autonomy in medical ethics. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience brings with it the necessity for an epistemological humility with respect to the lives of others and what can be said to be "right" for them. Appreciation of the subjective character of experience lies at the heart of empathy and our capacity to make decisions that genuinely reflect respect for the patient's autonomy. Through the example of a case involving extreme medical intervention, I identify some impediments to the proper recognition of autonomy. These kind of cases highlight the significance of affective responses with respect to the subjective character of experience, and, by extension, to our capacity to imagine and act in accordance with another's perspective. I argue that affective responses are appropriate and needed considerations in the case where one must attempt to assume another's perspective in order to respect autonomy. I conclude that understanding that experience has an irreducibly subjective character is essential to respecting patient autonomy.<br>

Abstract: Merleau-Ponty war die Geschichte dieses Theorems v. a. vermittelt durch die Schriften
Alains und Lagneaus gegenwärtig (s. Anm.15), auf die die Phänomenologie der Wahrnehmung
immer wieder anspielt. (Vgl. besonders die ausdrückliche Bezugnahme in § 11). Alain verweist
weiter auf Helmholtz' Handbuch der physiologischen Optik, die „die Konstanzannahme bestän-
dig stillschweigend voraussetzt und sich auf das Urteil nur beruft, um die in der physiologischen
Erklärung [der Wahrnehmung] verbliebenen Lücken auszufüllen" (Phänomenologie der Wahr-
nehmung, S. 54, Anm. 17). Die Konstanzannahme, die eine strikte physikalische Korrespondenz
zwischen externen Reizen und Empfindungen impliziert, verbindet sich im Rahmen einer duali-
stisch-intellektualistischen Theorie der Wahrnehmung mit einer psychologischen Theorie des
Urteilens, die erklären soll, wie aus (gemäß der Konstanzannahme rein hypothetisch vorauszuset-
zenden) Empfindungen Wahrnehmungen werden. Dementsprechend verbindet sich die Kritik der
Konstanzannahme (im Umfeld der Gestaltpsychologie) regelmäßig mit einer Zurückweisung des
Theorems vom unbewußten Schluß. Die innere Notwendigkeit dieses Zusammenhangs hat v. a.
Aron Gurwitsch begründet. So ζ. B. in dem 1933/4 im Institut d'Histoire des Sciences in Paris
gehaltenen Vortrag Die geschichtliche Entwicklung der Gestaltpsychologie, der in den von Mer-
leau-Ponty redigierten Artikel: Quelques aspects et quelques développements de la psychologie
de la forme. In: Journal de Psychologie 33 (Paris 1936) mündete (vgl. S. 414 ff). Zum Einfluß
Gurwitschs auf Merleau-Ponty in dieser Hinsicht vgl. auch James M. EdiE: Phenomenology in
the United States. In: Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 5 (1973/74), S. 207. Ab-
gesehen von Gur witsch und den Gestaltpsychologen, die seit Köhler (1910) die Konstanzan-
nahme kritisieren, konnte Merleau-Ponty eine mit phänomenologischen Motiven sich verknüp-
fende Kritik mit ihr einhergehender Wahrnehmungstheorien freilich auch schon~<br>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyse the political and mnemonic programme to be found in the last books of the British historian and thinker Tony Judt. The author of this article assumes that the final period of Judt's writing, in which he produced Ill Fares the Land, The Memory Chalet, and the posthumously published discussion with Timothy Snyder entitled Thinking the Twentieth Century, is dependent on a kind of 'art of memory'. For Judt, being terminally ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and thus condemned to immobility, this method became not so much—as in the case of its classic varieties—a technology of remembering, as a manner of recognizing and analyzing the contemporary world by turning to his own biography. The purpose was to construct a 'political testament' for the Western world in a time of crisis whose roots, according to Judt, can be found in the supremacy that 'economic' thinking has achieved over traditional political thought. In a gesture reminiscent of the Stoic 'techniques of the self' described by Michel Foucault, Judt, by exploiting his own no less complicated biography and identity, tries to throw light on the complicated history of the 20th century, containing the sources of 'our contemporary ills'. Biography and history thus meet here in a 'work of memory' whose horizon and catalyzer is the perspective of death, and whose stake is the idea of a political community experiencing, according to Judt, a period of inertia.<br>

Abstract: In this paper I take issue with Heidegger's use of the concept of death as a means of disclosing human finitude. I argue that Being-towards-death is inadequate to the disclosure of Dasein's thrownness which is necessary for the kind of authentic historizing that Heidegger describes and furthermore leads to a reading of authenticity which is preclusive of Being-with-Others. I suggest that this difficulty may be alleviated through increased attention to the opposite boundary of Dasein's existence, namely its birth. Although I do not pursue the project here of conducting a phenomenology of birth, I suggest some directions for proceeding with that task, and I illustrate that a greater emphasis on Dasein's beginning will increase the richness of our understanding of our Being-with-Others.<br>

Abstract: Once in 1997, in a lecture on 'L'avenir des religions en dialogue', at the Church of St Paul in Strasbourg, Paul Ricœur argued that Islam could not really take part in debates on modernity. Maybe he simply meant that Islam as a whole had not yet been worked upon by modernity, that it did not 'think' itself in modernity yet. This statement, which is certainly not to be understood as an exclusion of Islam, is indeed interesting from a philosopher of modernity who saw in the Weberian approach of history an 'anti-Hegelian solution'. This recalls how the great German philosopher handled Islam, which he undoubtedly admired, but which he also relegated to Oriental quietism. For Hegel, Islam vacated active history along with its 'progress' towards the fulfilment of the Idea of Liberty. In other words, modernity would henceforth proceed without Islam. Indeed, Max Weber did not really think about the situation of Islam in modernity, nor as an actor in modernity. At that time, much of the Muslim world was under European domination, and the army of the Ottoman empire itself was under the control of German experts. The Muslim Caliphate had moreover no other importance other than that with regard to Germany's Mitteleuropa policy. The other European powers that were to dismember the Ottoman empire were already 'Islamic powers', as can be read in Becker on the French colonial empire. Weber certainly witnessed the storm in the teacup echoed by his fellow countryman Becker and the Dutchman Snouck Hurgronje about the Ottoman Shayẖ al-islām's call to holy war. But he did not envisage the disappearance of the Caesaropapism and its consequences for Islam as a whole and, especially, for the Islamic Church, which was his focus of interest. What interests us here is that Weber, who underlined the linkage between the configuration of modern capitalism and Christian movements stemming from the Reformation, sometimes presents Islam as the antithesis of this modernity. Yet we speak at the momen~<br>

one of its goals to make a practical criticism derived from Derrida's work very diflicult, if
not impossible to realize' (p.207 n.3). Possibly Derrida's disciples, like those of Dooye-
weerd or Dewey or Hegel, misrepresent his genius, but Derridean authority is constantly
invoked on the world academie circuit today for its assembly-line scholarship of profes-
sional articles which continue to marginalize both philosophical and literary criticism. So
there is more warrant than chagrin to André Lefevere's sardonic remark: 'To produce
more and more interprétations of texts that have been interpreted for centuries may
appear to be a trifle redundant, except that it is a matter of bread and butter for most
interpreters.... (quoting Vincent Leitch, Deconstructive Criticism, 1983) 'There can never
be <correct> or <objective> readings, only more or less energetic, interesting, careful or
pleasurable misreadings.' Often the same person who writes this kind of thing then goes
home and grades the 'misreadings' of others, so that they, too, can take their place within
the academy, or be denied it, as the case may be.' Lefevere, '"Beyond Interprétation" or
The Business of (Re)Writing,' in Comparative Literature Studies 24 (no. 1, 1987): 18.
William Rowe, however, asks for a patient, 'more internai' critical reading of Derrida's
nomadic no-position. Cf. 'Critical study of [Sander Griffioen'sl The Problem of Progress',
in Philosophia Reformata 55 (no. 1, 1990): 80-83.<br>

Abstract: The 'unanswered questions' refer to questions like: (a) how is philosophy as theoretical
activity related to the practice of Connecting? (b) is ethics about what is good or about what is
right (cf. the contribution of John Hare in this volume)? and (c) is ethics concerned with all
sorts of normativity, or only with a particular 'ethical' kind of normativity? and if so, (d) how to
define this ethical normativity? I realize that in a full account of the position I defend, these
questions have to be addressed. For now, I don't want to bother too much about these more or
less technical preliminary issues, because it would distract too much from the main thesis of
this article.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Glas Gerrit<br>
Abstract: Dooyeweerd remained faithful to Abraham Kuyper (1898/1943, 20) here, specifically to
the well-known, almost infamous passage from the Lectures on Calvinism·.
"Hence the first claim demands that such a life system shall find its starting-point in a
special interpretation of our relation to God. This is not accidental, but imperative. If such
an action is to put its stamp upon our entire life, it must start from that point in our
consciousness in which our life is still undivided and lies comprehended in its unity, — not
in the spreading vines but in the root from which the vines spring. This point, of course, lies
in the antithesis between all that is finite in our human life and the infinite that lies beyond
it. Here alone we find the common source from which the different streams of our human
life spring and separate themselves. Personally it is our repeated experience that in the
depths of our hearts, at the point where we disclose ourselves to the Eternal One, all the
rays of our life converge as in one focus, and there alone regain that harmony which we so
often and so painfully lose in the stress of daily duty."
Wiskerke (1978, 75ff.) called this semi-mystical view 'the heart condition' of the philosophy of
the cosmonomic idea (see also the interesting notes on pp. 259ff). Kuyper's statement in the
Stone Lectures is in part based on his interpretation of Ecclesiastes 3:11 ('[God] has put
eternity into man's mind'):
"That age is the world of the Eternal, from which time, and with time all the finite, was
born.... The age that lets you leap over the boundaries of the finite and envelops you in the
ocean of the heavenly and Divine... that awakens your faith as a wholly other, wholly
independent faculty of thought and reveals you to yourself as a wholly other, far richer and
brilliant being than the world ever allowed you to see in its mirror." (De Héraut 1781, 18-2-
1912; cited in Dutch by Wiskerke 1978, 79).
Wiskerke suggests that this semi-mysticism evinces some~<br>

Abstract: French politics in the 1970s is notoriously hard to decipher. The increasingly violent attacks on Gaullism and Communism, the decline in French geopolitical power, and the end of postwar economic growth led to unprecedented unease about the nation's collective future. But rather than treat the 1970s as an endpoint, I argue in this article that the 1970s represented a new beginning. I explore how more modest conceptions of political action, the emergence of a new kind of liberalism, and the development of identity politics led to a profound transformation of French political culture – one that tried to reconcile France's long statist tradition with the realities of an ever-more fragmented polity.<br>

Abstract: The article tries to combine literature and anthropology by focusing on the >anthropotechnical< implications of the novel. As the most important medium of contemporary literature, the novel in a way >creates< man. Its forms and contents establish a kind of logic (logos) that deeply influences the self-description of individuals and of cultures and societies around the millenium. Considering the literary phenomenon as an experience that is both aesthetic and ethical, it can be called >novelology< (Romanologie). The huge success of novels such as Freedom by Jonathan Franzen and Der Turm by Uwe Tellkamp shows that readers appreciate even long and difficult narratives and finds aesthetic pleasure in complex semantic and literary patterns.<br>

Article Title: Hayden White: Beyond Irony<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1965<br>
Author(s): White Ewa<br>
Abstract: A crisis of our age that is usually identified with the loss of the sacred was one of the causes of the fall into irony in the nineteenth century. In the case of historians, as Hayden White has shown in Metahistory, this irony was caused by a "bitterness" stemming from the failure of reality to fulfill their expectations. An ironic apprehension of the world arose in an atmosphere of social breakdown or cultural decline. A current stage of irony manifests itself in a doubt as to the capacity of language to grasp reality. Thus we live in a "prison house of language." An intellectual parlor-game produces "second-hand knowledge" that cannot satisfy the needs of post-postmodern men and women still looking for another metanarrative. Therefore, the main purpose of this essay is to answer the question: how can we go beyond irony? This text is a "post-postmodern post mortem to postmodernism." I am grateful to post-modernism for many things, especially for giving me an alternative apprehension of the world in terms of difference and continuity rather than binary oppositions, but I am tired of ontological insecurity and epistemological chaos. I need order. I miss metanarrative. In trying to break with some modern/postmodern "principles" and retain within my discourse the premodernist perspective, I follow the current trend in the humanities. We observe at present the breakdown of methodology and the rise of a more poetic approach in the human sciences. Evidence of this phenomenon is the more autobiographical form of writing in anthropology (James Clifford, Clifford Geertz) and a more literary style in historical writing (Natalie Zemon Davis, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Simon Schama). This trend is associated with a revaluation of the subjective aspects of research. Perhaps, and I would welcome it, it also could be identified with a reappearance of a Collingwoodian idea of history as human self-knowledge, knowledge about human nature, knowledge about "what it is to be a man... wha~<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342968<br>
Date: 2 1, 1983<br>
Author(s): LaCapra Dale S.<br>
Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflection on these differences.<br>

Abstract: On September 11, 2001, the passengers and crew members aboard Flight 93 responded to the hijacking of their airplane by organizing a counterattack against the hijackers. The airplane crashed into an unpopulated field, causing no damage to human lives or national landmarks beyond the lives of those aboard the airplane. We draw on this story of courageous collective action to explore the question of what makes this kind of action possible. We propose that to take courageous collective action, people need three narratives-a personal narrative that helps them understand who they are beyond the immediate situation and manage the intense emotions that accompany duress, a narrative that explains the duress that has been imposed upon them sufficiently to make moral and practical judgments about how to act, and a narrative of collective action-and the resources that make the creation of these narratives feasible. We also consider how the creation of these narratives is relevant to courageous collective action in more common organizational circumstances, and identify how this analysis suggests new insights into our understanding of the core framing tasks of social movements, ways in which social movement actors draw on social infrastructure, the role of discourse and morality in social movements, the formation of collective identity, and resource mobilization.<br>

Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i25501821<br>
Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Emery Jacob<br>
Abstract: Andrey Bely's novel "Petersburg" (one of the high points of Russian literary modernism and a rough analogue to James Joyce's Ulysses) repeatedly claims that parent and child, being of the same flesh and blood, share an ambivalent identity. At the same time, because the novel opens by invoking a major character's genealogical relation to Adam, the book implies that this kin identity is universal and can be applied to the entire human race. This essay analyzes the role of kinship metaphor in "Petersburg", demonstrating that tropes of parent-child identity facilitate the novel's dizzying metaphoric conflation, that they form a kind of metafictional mirror in which the novel probes its own nature as a work of the imagination, and that Bely's theory and practice of metaphor touch on broader philosophical issues of figure and fictionality.<br>

Author(s): Lippitt John<br>
Abstract: In recent commentary on Kierkegaard's Works of Love, a distinction is commonly drawn between 'proper' and 'selfish' forms of self-love. In arguing that not all vices of self-focus can be captured under the heading of selfishness, I seek to distinguish selfishness from self-centredness. But the latter vice has a far more handsome cousin: proper self-focus of the kind necessary for 'becoming a self'. As various feminist thinkers have argued, this will be missed if we valorise self-sacrifice too uncritically. But nor need the latter concept be ditched. By distinguishing varieties of self-sacrifice, we can see the importance of avoiding the all too easy slide from proper self-sacrifice to outright self-annihilation. And we can discover that this avoidance is aided by recognising a kind of pride as part of true self-love.<br>

Issue: i345615<br>
Date: 6 1, 1958<br>
Author(s): Wittgenstein Daniel<br>
Abstract: This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons-explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advocates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assessing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his `extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the orthodoxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears.<br>

Author(s): Lee Sang Uk<br>
Abstract: I will investigate in this paper what kind of "Weltanschauung" Freud suggests. Although Freud argues in the lecture XXXV, "The Question of a "Weltanschauung" (1933)," that psychoanalysis is incapable of creating a "Weltanschauung" of its own, I think that he has a certain "Weltanschauung", i.e., the aesthetic worldview, which involves his scientific, psychoanalytic, and artistic principles. Furthermore, I will explicate that Freud's aesthetic worldview is ultimately related to the "Weltanschauungen" of William James and Paul Ricoeur. I will focus particularly on their terms, "sympathetic" and "poetic," which are the crucial elements that constitute the aesthetic "Weltanschauung". Finally, I will briefly present my intention in drawing this aesthetic "Weltanschauung". I will conclude that throughout the aesthetic "Weltanschauung" we may accept that everything is precious, pertinent, and worthy to be viewed as a part and a whole, and as home (Heim).<br>

Issue: i27643230<br>

Author(s): Doja Albert<br>
Abstract: The system of beliefs and practices related to Bektashism seems to have corresponded to a kind of liberation theology, whereas the structure of Bektashi groups corresponded more or less to the type of religious organization conventionally known as charismatic groups. It becomes understandable therefore that their spiritual tendency could at times connect with and meet social, cultural and national perspectives. In turn, when members of the previously persecuted religious minority will acquire a degree of religious and political respectability within society at large, the doctrines of heterodoxy and liberation theology fade into the background. In the end, the heirs of the heterodox promoters of spiritual reform and social movement turn into followers and faithful defenders of a legitimate authority. They become the spokespeople for an institutionalized orthodoxy whose support is sought by the political regime.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i27646172<br>
Date: 12 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Westphal Merold<br>
Abstract: The kind of phenomenology that can be useful to theology will be a hermeneutical phenomenology, one that takes us beyond the Cartesian/Husserlian ideal of presuppositionless intuition. It will also be a phenomenology of inverse intentionality, one in which the constituting subject is constituted by the look and the voice of another. In light of these suggestions, the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion is defended against three critiques, namely that it compromises the boundary between phenomenology and theology, that the theology it serves is a bad one to boot, and that it has an inadequate account of the subject. At the heart of this defense is Marion's clear distinction between phenomenology as a description of possible experience, and theology as the claim that a certain kind of experience, namely revelation or epiphany, is not merely actual but veridical. Phenomenology says, If revelation occurs it will be in the form of a saturated phenomenon. Theology says, for example, the burning bush was an epiphany, or Jesus Christ is a revelation. The attentive reader should have no trouble distinguishing Marion's phenomenological analyses, which should be persuasive to believer and unbeliever alike, from his theological claims. Marion's account of the subject falls under the heading of inverse intentionality, and there are hints that vision is aufgehoben in the voice. The seer is first of all the one seen, but above all the one addressed, called forth into response-able being.<br>

Abstract: Visual sociology has two main interests: picture-making by researchers (or their subjects) in the course of sociological fieldwork, and pictures made by social actors in the context of everyday life. Focusing on the latter interest and based in three social aspects of images—that they are produced in general societal settings and specific institutional settings, and are a kind of discursive practice—three approaches to the sociology of visual material are illustrated.<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>

Author(s): Duque Sonia<br>
Abstract: La autora se interroga acerca del significado de la expresión construir la paz en situaciones posteriores a la comisión de crímenes masivos. Subraya las dificultades específicas que plantea este tipo de circunstancias tanto a los analistas como a los profesionales que participan del proceso, y hace una serie de propuestas metodológicas que atañen al impacto de los crímenes masivos sobre la reconstrucción de las relaciones sociales y políticas en sociedades desgarradas por la guerra. Además, pone énfasis en la importancia de una mejor comprensión de estos procesos, con el fin de destacar los programas de asistencia más eficaces, ya que aquéllos surgen en situaciones sociopolíticas particulares. Al intentar una aproximación a este delicado tema, analistas y profesionales enfrentan dos retos. Primero, deben entender cómo pudo haberse llevado a cabo el crimen masivo. Segundo, deben identificar las posibilidades de paz existentes dentro de la sociedad afectada. Indudablemente, para que las reglas del juego social y político funcionen o, en otras palabras, para que todos los actores se interesen en unirse al juego colectivo, tales posibilidades no pueden ser ignoradas. La construcción de la paz debe incluir métodos locales que, en la mayoría de los casos, se han ido construyendo con el tiempo y han adoptado diferentes métodos provenientes de otras latitudes. /// The author questions the meaning of the expression "peace-building" in circumstances following the perpetration of massive crimes. She stresses the specific difficulties raised by these kind of situations to both analysts and professionals involved in the process, and puts forward a series of methodological proposals concerning the impact of massive crimes on social and political relations' reconstruction within societies torn by war. Also, the author underlines the relevance of having a better understanding of these processes in order to identify which assistance programs may be more effective, as those processes~<br>

Abstract: En este artículo se abordan algunas de las cuestiones metodológicas que plantea el análisis de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres en la historia, como contrapunto a la existencia de este tipo de violencia en nuestra sociedad. En primer lugar se exponen las diferentes fórmulas que se utilizan para nombrarla —«violencia de género», «violencia sexista», «violencia sexual», «violencia doméstica o familiar», «violencia de pareja», «violencia machista»...—, sus significados y connotaciones políticas, y su validez conceptual para la investigación histórica; a continuación se tratan algunos de los problemas que surgen al estudiar la violencia contra las mujeres a partir de las fuentes documentales históricas, y, finalmente, se analiza cómo puede repercutir en el presente el análisis histórico de la violencia de los hombres contra las mujeres. This essay considers some of the methodological issues raised by the analysis of male violence against women in the past, as a counterpoint to the persistence of this kind of violence in our society. In the first place, the author examines the different expressions used to name this kind of violence —«gender violence», «sexist violence»,«sexual violence», «domestic violence or violence in the family», «partner violence in couples», «macho violence»...—,their meaning and political connotations. Some of the problems posed by the study of violence against women based on historical documentary sources are considered thereafter, to finish analyzing the possible effects on the present situation of an historical analysis of male violence against women.<br>

Article Title: Anthropology as a Kind of Writing<br>
Publisher: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland<br>
Issue: i330179<br>
Date: 3 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Spencer Jonathan<br>
Abstract: This article reviews the recent interest in the literary aspects of ethnographic writing, concentrating on the work of Geertz, Sperber and the authors associated with the collective volume Writing culture. While it is argued that serious questions are raised in some of this work, it is also argued that recent fashions in literary critical theory may prove unhelpful in addresing those questions. In particular, the tendency to read texts with little or no consideration for the social and historical context in which they were written seems an especially barren approach. Instead it is argued that anthropology is as much a way of working-a kind of practical activity-as it is a way of writing. Acknowledgement of the personal element in the making of ethnographic texts may help the reader to a better assessment of the interpretation on offer; more radical change requires a change in anthropological practice as well as in anthropological writing.<br>

Abstract: Literature discussing rhetoric is mainly concerned with rhetoric per se - its structure, and the categorization of arguments by kind. Rarely do rhetorical studies examine the actual effects on audiences, and auditors' reactions. On the other hand, sociological studies of scientific controversies look at rhetoric - or argumentation - in action, but with few references to rhetorical studies. The purpose of this paper is to integrate rhetorical studies into the sociology of technology in order to integrate the concept of action into discourse analysis. I intend to show how the use of discourse to enroll actors in a health technology is intimately linked to action. I deconstruct the promoters' strategy into two discursive components - the utility component and the fear-reduction component - to show how the rhetoric of expectations (utility) and representations (fear) contingently shape the fate of a technology.<br>

Abstract: To serve their purpose well, many so-called mnemonic images in the Middle Ages facilitated meditation and invention by presenting many rich materials in a highly abbreviated form, which could be expanded and recombined for a variety of compositions. To abbreviate fruitfully requires rigorous compression and selection, a kind of forgetting that was distinguished both in theory and practice from rote recitation or learning by heart. The twelfth- and thirteenth-century diagram called the Cherub offers an excellent example of how such an image was used in study and composition. Focusing on six versions of it, this essay demonstrates that the medieval cherub image is not an illustration tied to any particular text but functioned independently as an analytical tool, an art for inventing arguments, which incorporated the methods of medieval dialectic and rhetoric.<br>

Article Title:  The Power of the Impure: Transgression, Violence and Secrecy in Bengali Śākta Tantra and Modern Western Magic <br>
Publisher: Brill Academic Publishers<br>
Issue: i364859<br>
Date: 1 1, 1970<br>
Author(s): Shepherd Hugh B.<br>
Abstract: Since their first encounter with the complex body of texts and traditions called "Tantras," Western scholars have been simultaneously repulsed and horrified, yet also tantalized and titillated by the deliberate use of normally impure and defiling substances in Tantric practice. Yet, with a few exceptions, they have made little headway in interpreting the deeper religious and social role of impurity, either in Tantric ritual or in the history of religions generally. This paper compares the role of ritual impurity and transgression in two very different traditions, widely separated both historically and geographically: the Śākta school of Tantra in Bengal (focusing on the 16th century brāhmaṇ, Kṛṣṇānanda Āgamavāgīśa) and modern Western magic (focusing on Aleister Crowley and the Ordo Templi Orientis). Specifically, I look closely at the manipulation of impure bodily substances-such as blood, semen and vaginal fluids-in sexual rituals and animal sacrifice. By playing off of these two examples in a kind of metaphoric juxtaposition, I hope to shed some new light on the role of impurity, transgression and secrecy in both cases and also in the comparative study of religion as a whole. Adapting some insights from Georges Bataille and Michel Foucault, I argue that the ritual use of impurity has much larger social and political implications, as a means of harnessing the tremendous power that flows through the physical universe, the human body and the social body alike.<br>

Author(s): Wrigley Trevor J.<br>
Abstract: In this article, I reflect upon and attempt to understand the changing theoretical nature of post-World War II Anglo-American economic geography. In particular, I contrast the kind of theorizing that first occurred in the discipline during the 1950s with the very different kind now carried out under what has been called the "cultural turn" or the "new economic geography." I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i40000755<br>
Date: 6 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Gregory Eric<br>
Abstract: This paper examines a remarkable document that has escaped critical attention within the vast literature on John Rawls, religion, and liberalism: Rawls's undergraduate thesis, "A Brief Inquiry into the Meaning of Sin and Faith: An Interpretation Based on the Concept of Community" (1942). The thesis shows the extent to which a once regnant version of Protestant theology has retreated into seminaries and divinity schools where it now also meets resistance. Ironically, the young Rawls rejected social contract liberalism for reasons that anticipate many of the claims later made against him by secular and religious critics. The thesis and Rawls's late unpublished remarks on religion and World War II offer a new dimension to his intellectual biography. They show the significance of his humanist response to the moral impossibility of political theology. Moreover, they also reveal a kind of Rawlsian piety marginalized by contemporary debates over religion and liberalism.<br>

Author(s): Wattles Jeffrey<br>
Abstract: The drama of Plato's brush with the kind of thinking formulated in the golden rule--"Do to others as you want others to do to you"--discloses (1) ambiguity in the rule, due to its association with the popular Greek practice of helping friends and harming enemies, and (2) an unnoticed philosophic and/or religious solution to a problem raised by this ambiguity. Revising Albrecht Dihle's influential analysis in "Die Goldene Regel" (1962), this article explores the philosophic implications of golden-rule thinking in three of Plato's sources--Homer, Herodotus, and Isocrates--and in three texts from the dialogues: "Crito" 50a-54d, "Phaedo" 62b-c, and "Laws" 913a.<br>

Abstract: There is something profoundly disturbing in the concept of politics as an agon, a site of contestation, struggle, and competition. Action in a world of pervasive and irreducible conflict risks exposing the individual to the contingency of all unity, including the unity of the self, and thus forces individuals to recognize their own internal divisions and contradictions. This article considers the possibility of enduring, surviving, and excelling at agonistic politics. It asks what kind of individuality, what mode of thinking about and addressing the person's inner plurality, might provide the capacities to survive participation in the democratic agon and thus sustain democracy as a form of politics. Accounts of agonistic politics concur in imagining the individual as engaged in what might be called an inner agonism; therefore my analysis focuses on the reasons for this mimetic relationship between individuality and politics. I argue that mimesis in political imagination draws out particular sorts of affective responses, orienting the person to her political world in ways that might provide precisely the sorts of resources needed for action.<br>

Article Title: The Phenomenology of Falling Ill: An Explication, Critique and Improvement of Sartre's Theory of Embodiment and Alienation<br>
Publisher: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers<br>
Issue: i40010631<br>

Abstract: In this paper I develop a phenomenology of falling ill by presenting, interpreting and developing the basic model we find in Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness (1956). The three steps identified by Sartre in this process are analysed, developed further and brought to a five- step model: (1) pre-reflective experience of discomfort, (2) lived, bodily discomfort, (3) suffered illness, (4) disease pondering, and (5) disease state. To fall ill is to fall victim to a gradual process of alienation, and with each step this alienating process is taken to a new qualitative level. Consequently, the five steps of falling ill have not only a contingent chronological order but also a kind of logical order, in that they typically presuppose each other. I adopt Sartre's focus on embodiment as the core ground of the alienation process, but point out that the alienation of the body in illness is not only the experience of a psychic object, but an experience of the independent life of one's own body. This facticity of the body is the result neither of the gaze of the other person, nor of a reflection adopting the outer perspective of the other in an indirect way, but is a result of the very otherness of one's own body, which addresses and plagues us when we fall ill. I use examples of falling ill and being a patient to show how a phenomenology of falling ill can be helpful in educating health-care personnel (and perhaps also patients) about the ways of the lived body.<br>

Abstract: Com este texto o autor procura uma resposta para a seguinte pergunta: "Que tipo de método poderá confirmar ou infirmar a hipótese segundo a qual o acto educativo é, no seu núcleo e na sua origem entitativa, confrontação violenta entre duas consciências?". Depois de esclarecer que esta hipótese inter-pretativa da educação tem em mira, não explicar ou descrever a realidade educacional na sua positividade, mas compreender o seu eidos ou essência constitutiva, o autor decide-se, na esteira de Husserl, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Duméry, Dufrenne, Levinas e Derrida, pelo método fenomenológico. Para efectuar a exploração filosófica que essa pergunta impõe, o método instituído por Husserl faculta, ao invés dos métodos positivistas e analíticos, uma visão global do fenómeno educativo numa intuição que se atinge depois de realizada uma redução eidética. Além disso, o método fenomenológico é entendido como o mais adequado para desvelar uma realidade cuja textura é tecida por relações intersubjectivas. Todo o texto desenvolve uma sequência argumentativa tendente a mostrar e a demonstrar quer a natureza, quer as potencialidades heurísticas do método fenomenológico aplicado à educação. Só este método poderá evidenciar a estrutura universal e necessária da educação: uma relação violenta entre duas consciências. /// Dans son texte l'auteur cherche une réponse pour la question suivante: "que type de méthode pourra confirmer ou infirmer l'hypothèse selon laquelle l'acte éducatif est en son centre et en son origine confrontation violente entre deux consciences"?

Publisher: Higher Education Press and Springer<br>

Author(s): Lin Zhang<br>
Abstract: Judging Gadamer's theoretical stance is a complicated matter, and his ontological hermeneutics is usually regarded as a text-centered theory of understanding. Through an analysis of the phenomenological premises from which his theories take off, however, we can clearly see his reader-centric stance. On the basis of this stance some cease to seek for the original intention of the author or the original meaning of the text, which ineluctably leads to the ignorance of an understanding methodology. As far as people's intentional understanding is concerned, however, the important as well as essential task is still that of striving for a certain kind of understanding that is relatively correct, with universally effective methodology as its necessary prerequisite. What is more, herein lies the significance of the epistemology of hermeneutics. This article aims to re-insert a sense of methodology after hermeneutics went through a period of ontological reflection, and hence clarify that it is of necessity that hermeneutics resumes its text-centric methodological stance. /// 判定加达默尔的理论立场是一个复杂的问题。他的本体论诠释学一般被视为 一种文本中心论的理解理论，然而通过对他所从出发的现象学前提之分析，可以清 楚地看出他的读者中心论的立场.正是基于这一立场，放弃了对作者原意或文本原 义之诉求，必然导致对理解方法论的漠视。但是，就人们有意识的理解活动而言， 首要的以及根本的任务仍然是努力获得某种相对正确的理解，而普遍有效的方法论 就是其必要的前提，诠释学的认识论意义便在于此.在诠释学经历了本体论的反思 后，应重新注入一种方法论的意识，回到以文本为中心的方法论立场.<br>

Abstract: Memory brings the past into the present. It is a feature of human temporality, contingency, and identity. Attention to memory's psychological and social importance suggests new vistas for work in religious ethics. This essay examines four recent works on memory's importance for self-interpretation, social criticism, and public justice. My focus will be on normative questions about memory. The works under review ask whether, and on what terms, we have an obligation to remember, whether memory is linked to neighbors near and distant, how memory is related to justice and forgiveness, and whether memory sits easily with the kind of relationships that allegedly characterize life in democratic public culture.<br>

Author(s): Love Jeff<br>
Abstract: My article contends that Dostoevsky's short novel, The Gambler, is marked by a fundamental conflict of temporalities. While the novel seems to embrace bourgeois optimism and the hopeful narrative temporality that serves as its most resourceful literary embodiment, it also seems to adhere to a strikingly anti-teleological and circular narrative structure. This affirmation and denial of temporality as linear, purposive movement is the appropriate narrative emblem of the peculiar world of Roulettenburg and its inhabitants, a world where beginning and end continually risk equivalence and where the parameters of structure have therefore begun to dissolve. What emerges is an acceptance of inevitable boredom, of permanent failure to resolve conflict, that is both constricting and liberating. As an artistic principle of form, this failure declares a "poetics" of hesitation whose temporal dimensions brilliantly reflect the fundamentally ambivalent eros of the gambler, the latter's inability to accept or escape from a debilitating presentness. In creating this kind of narrative conflict, Dostoevsky reverses the characteristic romantic obsession with the allure of pregnant immediacy that is an illusion of god-like vision to which only a most ungod-like being could succumb.<br>

Abstract: After the 'death of God', it would be a mistake to continue to think of eros in terms of a longing for possession ofthat which one is lacking, especially in matters of religion. Alongside Plato's Diotima, Kierkegaard, Levinas and even Heidegger, an alternative view of eros is proposed in which eros is gradually letting go of its possessive cravings in order to open itself for the other. In this way, eros is bent in the directionof the unselfish service of the other. The question is then asked which kind of understanding of being is implied by this redirection of eros. The answer is taken from a thinking of the meaning of being in terms of self-givenness and self-outpooring in beings, for beings to be 'there'. Our being at the service of the other can therefore be seen as a following of the call of being in us to become adequate to the meaning of being itself.<br>

Abstract: Partindo de urna analogía, sugerida por Arthur Danto, com o que se passa no mundo artístico pós-moderno, o artigo começa por reconsiderar o estatuto da história narrativa no actual contexto da disciplina, caracterizado pela explosão dos géneros historiográfícos, para se debruçar seguidamente sobre o problema de saber que tipo ou tipos de verdade histórica a narrativa veicula.

Puis, il se penche sur la question de savoir quel(s) type(s) de vérité historique est véhiculée par la narration. With an analogy of the post-modern artistic world proposed by Arthur Danto as its starting point, the article reconsiders the role of narrative history in the current context of the subject.

Abstract: La première partie de cet article (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) envisageait, pour le siècle nouveau, un judéo-christianisme compatible avec l'athéisme contemporain, car il consisterait en une sorte de pratique « théâtrale » qui, de la tradition, ne retiendrait pas la foi métaphysique et historique mais le couple péché/Rédemption vécu comme une sorte d'illusion positive. On essaie maintenant de déterminer le rôle qu'ont pu jouer, dans ce devenir : Kant, Bergson, Freud, le pape Jean-Paul II et certains philosophes français d'aujourd'hui (Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion). The first part of this paper (Revue philosophique, 2001-4, p. 435-480) was studying, for this coming century, a new judeo-christianism compatible with contemporary atheism since it would consist in some kind of a theatrical practice. This new form of judeo-christianism would keep from tradition no longer the metaphysical and historical faith but the couple sin/redemption, lived as some kind of a positive illusion. One now attempts at determining what may be the part played in such a process by Kant, Bergson, Freud, Pope John Paul II and a few French philosophers of today (namely : Michel Henry, Alain Juranville, Jean-Luc Marion).<br>

Abstract: L'auteur analyse les deux figures du dépassement de la métaphysique qui ont existé au XXe siècle : la phénoménologie, après être partie d'une vigoureuse critique de la métaphysique, d'inspiration positiviste, a tendu à devenir une nouvelle sorte de métaphysique, puis, comme telle, a subi la critique de la philosophie analytique naissante. La question est posée de savoir ce qui pourrait être conservé aujourd'hui des deux traditions, phénoménologique et analytique, en termes de critique de la métaphysique. The author analyses both the figures of the overcoming of metaphysics that existed in the XXth century : after starting from a strong criticism against metaphysics, of a positivist inspiration, phenomenology has tended to become a new kind of metaphysics, and then, as such, suffered the criticism of the newborn Analytic philosophy. The question is : what can be preserved now from both traditions, i.e. the phenomenological and the Analytic, in terms of a criticism of metaphysics ?<br>

Abstract: Windelband, réputé comme chef de l'école néokantienne de Bade, s'oppose comme Bergson au relativisme et au positivisme. Pour lui, comprendre Kant, c'est le dépasser, et ce, dans la direction de Hegel ; lire Bergson, c'est retrouver le sens de l'événement dans une métaphysique de l'irrépétable, qui, en montrant l'insuffisance du criticisme, ouvre la porte aux sciences historiques. Cela est l'interprétation positive de Bergson. Mais la critique est qu'il faut séparer totalement la psychologie de la philosophie, contrairement à la tradition philosophique française, encore observée par Bergson. Mais le volontarisme bergsonien apparaît comme représentatif de l'esprit de la philosophie du tournant du XIXe au XXe siècle. Mieux encore, avec Bergson, la philosophie retrouve l'ambition (hégélienne) d'être une vision globale du monde. Windelband, well-known for being the leader of the Neo-Kantian School of Bade, together with Bergson, is opposed to both relativism and positivism. According to him, understanding Kant means going further than the latter and, more, in Hegel's direction. Reading Bergson means finding again the meaning of event within metaphysics of what may not be repeated which, by showing the insufficiency of criticism, opens a new way towards historical sciences. Such is the positivie interpretation of Bergson. But the criticism is such as one should imperatively separate psychology from philosophy, contrary to the French philosophical tradition, still observed by Bergson. But Bergsonian voluntarism appears as some kind of representative of the spirit of philosophy at the turn of the 19th-20th century. Better further, with Bergson philosophy recaptures its (Hegelian) ambition to become a global vision of the world.<br>

Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: Theodore Abel belonged before Talcott Parsons to the pioneers of "Weberians"' kind in America. In his Systematic Sociology in Germany the first systematic exposure of Max Weber's ideas in English appeared. Abel was the first to use Verstehen and Verstehende Soziologie in English literature. Abel also pioneered the research on the Nazi phenomenon. The manifestations of nazism and communist totalitarianism in the 20th century put the sociological theory and methodology to a critical test. Examining Abel's work as a case study, it is possible to see more clearly the ethical and methodological problems of the humanistic sociology—the "understanding" or interpretative one. The sense and implications of understanding in sociology still require greater clarity in order to better understand the understanding. Abel's diary sheds light on the methodological problems of his understanding research of nazism. The source of danger and ethical dilemmas of that discipline lies in the tradition of understanding sociology and Weber's method of ideal types connected with the principle of freedom from valuation. Also in that very tradition there are beginnings for development of its rightful cause and vocation. Provided, just like in Znaniecki's concept of humanistic coefficient, not only meanings but also valuations and social sentiments given in people's experience are taken into account. Full understanding cannot imply complete tolerance if meanings and values of individuals and groups are coupled with hate and other hostile feelings. Social feelings—hate and love (altruism)— constitute a sociologist's axiological system of negative and positive reference.<br>

Abstract: The gaps, fissures, and lapses of attention in a life—what I call "ordinary oblivions"—are fertile fragilities that present a compelling source for ethics. Plato, not Aristotle, is the ancient philosopher specially poised to speak to this feature of human life. Drawing upon poet C. K. Williams's idea that forgetting is a "looking away" that makes possible "beginning again," I present a Platonic approach to ethics as an alternative to Aristotelian or virtue ethics. Plato's Phaedrus is a key source text for this alternate picture; from it I suggest how we might construe Iris Murdoch's "task of seeing" in terms of the engagement with written form. Poetry is a central locale for such engagement, and thus suggests a kind of ethical praxis that arises from the theoretical emphases of my examination of forgetting, the unmoored self, remade other-regard, and sacred sources.<br>

Abstract: This study argues that the exponential growth of divinatory texts variously attributed to ᶜAlī and Jaᶜfar al-Ṣādiq included at the end of Qur'ans produced during the Ṣafavid period provides further evidence for the widespread interest in divination during the tenth/sixteenth and eleventh/seventeenth centuries in Iran. Treatises on 'divination by the Qur'an' (fāl-i Qur'ān) indicate that it was considered permissible to seek guidance by means of holy scripture at this time. On a more symbolic level, fāl-i Qur'āns can be understood as a kind of restoration of the 'defective' ᶜUthmānic codex by re-Shïᶜifying it-if not by reinserting supposedly dropped verses on the ahi al-bayt, then at the very least by adding terminal divinations attributed to the figureheads of Shīᶜī Islam. This particular practice therefore follows general 'Shīᶜification' trends found in a number of cultural and artistic practices of the Ṣafavid period, which also are potentially discernible within the domain of Qur'an production. هذه الدراسة تذهب إلى أن النمو الهائل من النصوص التي تتنبأ بالمستقبل والمنسوبة بأشكال مختلفة لعلي وجعفر الصادق والملحقة بنهاية المصاحف التي أنتجت ﺧﻼﻝ الفترة الصفوية تقدم مزيداﹰ من اﻷدلة على اﻻهتمام واسع النطاق بالعراﻓﺔ في ايران ﺧﻼﻝ القرون / العاشر والحادي عشر السادس عشر / السابع عشر . وتشير المصنفات في الفأل بالقرآن إلى أنه ﺧﻼﻝ تلك الحقبة كان التماس التوجيه من الكتاب المقدس يعتبر أمرا جائزاﹰ. على مستوى أكثر رمزية، فإن فأل القرآن يمكن أن يفهم على أنه معالجة للمصحف العثماني بإعادة " تشييعه " وهذا وإن لم يكن من ﺧﻼﻝ إعادة آيات تتعلق بآل البيت يدعى أنها مسقطة من اﻷصل، فعلى اﻷقل من ﺧﻼﻝ زيادة تنبؤات في آخر المصحف بعد النص القرآني منسوبة لرموز الشيعة. لهذا فإن هذا العمل يتبع توجهات " تشييع " وجدت في عدد من الممارسات الثقافية والفنية في العصر الصفوي يمكن أيضاﹰ ﻣﻼحظتها في إطار إنتاج المصاحف .<br>

Abstract: Notre étude examine la manière dont les principales injonctions de la méthode phénoménologique, telle qu'elle a été mise en place par Husserl et remaniée par Heidegger, sont reprises ou critiquées par la phénoménologie française contemporaine au tournant du xxi e siècle. En un premier temps, c'est le rôle qu'assume la réduction au sein de la phénoménologie de la donation élaborée par Jean-Luc Marion qui est analysé, ainsi que les conséquences méthodologiques de sa compréhension du phénomène et, tout particulièrement, la neutralisation du recours à l'herméneutique qui en découle. Nous faisons voir l'importance de la réfutation de l'hypothèse d'une non-donation par la phénoménologie de la saturation et le poids croissant qu'y gagne le concept d'événement. Cette dernière considération nous conduit à une confrontation avec l'herméneutique événementiale proposée par Claude Romano qui, tout en avançant une des plus radicales critiques de la réduction phénoménologique, plaide pour une phénoménologie herméneutique d'un type nouveau, attentive à l'autonomie et à la spécificité de la perception. The study shows how the main prescriptions of the phenomenological method, established by Husserl and redefined by Heidegger, are prolonged or criticized in French contemporary phenomenology at the turn of the 21st century. Firstly, the role played by reduction within Jean-Luc Marion's phenomenology of givenness is analyzed, together with the methodological consequences of its phenomenon concept, such as the caution towards hermeneutics. The importance of the refutation of a hypothetical non-givenness and the considerable weight gained by the notion of event are also stressed. From this point of view, a confrontation with Claude Romanos hermeneutics of the event appears as highly relevant, allowing to present one of the most radical critics of phenomenological reduction and to discover a new kind of hermeneutical phenomenology, open to the autonomy of perception.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40069706<br>
Date: 12 1, 2010<br>
Author(s): Fernández Germán Darío<br>
Abstract: I propose a few epistemological and methodological reflexions to account for intercultural daily communication. These reflexions emerged during a sociological research in Mendoza, Argentina, with Huarpes Indigenous students at the University of Cuyo. I observed that Indigenous people became quasi "ethnographers" of diverse environments. To make intelligible their classmates' behavior, and to account for their own behavior, Huarpes follow, in diverse environments and interactions, public rules of meaning. The objective of this paper is twofold: (a) to stress the methodological scope of ordinary communication and ordinary reasoning in order to study understanding between people from different groups and categories, and (b) to contest a kind of "pessimist" standpoint in social sciences and philosophy according to which the use of ordinary language reduces possibilities for understanding. Interviews, participant observation in natural situations, and a review of literature about language and understanding are the basis of this paper.<br>

Abstract: The traditional mode of explanation in physics via deduction from partial differential equations is contrasted here with explanation via simulations. I argue that the different technologies employed constitute different languages, which support different sorts of narratives. The narratives that accompany simulations and articulate their meaning are typically historical or natural historical in kind. They explain complex phenomena by growing them rather than by referring them to general laws. Examples of such growth simulations and growth narratives come from the evolution of wave functions in quantum chaos, snowflake formation, and Etruscan genetics. The examples suggest a few concluding remarks on historical explanation.<br>

Abstract: This paper raises the question whether language and violence are internally connected. It starts from the experience of violence and from its theoretical interpretation as violence in the context of political forms of life which are challenged by complaints about violence. Such forms of life have to confront this issue because they are supposed to be responsive to claims and demands of others who articulate violence as an experience of violation. Whether a kind of responsive ethos may be based on the suspected inner connection between language and violence is being discussed at the end.<br>

Abstract: This study represents a Chapter from a section devoted to the composition of a literary work and is part of a larger project called ‘The Poetics of a Work of Literature in the Twentieth Century’, which is being undertaken by the Theory Department of the Institute of Czech Literature. The fragment and fragmentariness in a twentieth-century literary work are a manifestation of a marked tendency towards discontinuity or in some cases towards continuity of a certain kind. There exist works of art that for various reasons remain fragments without, however, being preceived as such (the novels of Kafka and Ladislav Klíma’s Velký román, are cases in point); on the other hand, the fragment, that is to say an intentional fragment (such as a sketch or a synopsis), becomes an independent genre whose roots go back to Romanticism (for instance Novalis’s fragment). The fragment and fragmentarieness that manifests itself in the text in the widest possible number of ways (intentional incompleteness and sporadicity, ‘blank spots’ in the Story, the mixing of heterogeneous elements, the alternating of various genres within one work, and so on), we understand as a reaction to the idea about the work as a complete, inlernally unified and accomplished whole with a clear and single Sense, an idea that Classicism molleyeoddled, which was then to a large exient done by Realism and with it all so-called decadent literature (including tendencious, Socialist-Realist literature). The fragment and fragmentariness (with which is linked the idea of a sense that continuously defies being pinned down to any one definition, which follows from its quality of not being fully told, from suggestion, hints, silence, gaps and ‘ holes’) are, in the literature of the twentieth century, perceived as both a genre and also as approaches that can express the open nature of being and of the world better than the whole work can.

Author(s): Marx John<br>
Abstract: The seventeenth century was not finished in eighteenth-century England. The ghosts of the 'Great Rebellion' continued to haunt Hanoverian England as political groupings struggled for some kind of control of representations of the past. One of the explicit purposes of Hume's "History of England" (1752-64) was to exorcize these ghosts of the past and to delegitimize the political memories of Whigs, Tories and Jacobites, churchmen and dissenters. This article focuses on the account of the puritans in the "History of England." In significant ways this contravenes Hume's own agenda. Out of his anti-puritan history there emerges the negative figure of the radical political intellectual which was subsequently appropriated by Burke and by wider forces of political reaction in England in the 1790s. Far from escaping the obsolete antagonisms of the past which continued to shape Hanoverian political hostilities, Hume in his "History of England" contributed to their reproduction and even intensification from the 1770s.<br>

Publisher: Northern Illinois University<br>
Issue: i40113416<br>
Date: 10 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Burgan Mary<br>
Abstract: Despite recent critical denigrations of the representation of temporality as a defining interest in narrative, it is important to reappraise the epiphany as a feature of the short stories of "founding" modernist women writers like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Nevertheless, the association of the epiphanic story with "feminine" writing drove a writer like Doris Lessing to reject the epiphany as an organizing principle in her stories; she chose, instead, the more fabular, allegorical model of a writer like D. H. Lawrence. Finally, however, Lessing, like other women writers of the short story, kept in touch with the intuition of revelation in moments of being whose power act not only as organizers of narrative but also as significations of a kind of feminine sensory apprehension of temporality. This discursive implementation of the moment as the center of modernist women writers' short fiction may be recuperated so as to preserve their achievements from the preference for a decentered écriture féminine.<br>

Abstract: Godefroid Kurth, historien méthodique rigoureux du début du XXe siècle, et Jean d'Outremeuse, chroniqueur prolixe mais brouillon du XIVe siècle, partagent a priori le même « métier », celui d'historien. Pourtant, entre ces deux personnages se dresse un gouffre abyssal, celui de deux visions de l'histoire entièrement opposées. Pour l'un, l'histoire est constituée d'événements assurés, reconstruits par une minutieuse étude des sources. Pour l'autre, l'histoire est un puits d'anecdotes propres à intéresser un public, elle est construite à coups de légendes, d'inventions personnelles qui visent à la vraisemblance aussi bien qu'à créer un véritable récit historique. Lorsque Godefroid Kurth a publié en 1910 son étude critique sur Jean d'Outremeuse, celui-ci n'était plus à même de se défendre. Il fut en conséquence lentement oublié, et sa vision de l'histoire vouée aux gémonies. Quel regard l'historien actuel doit-il porter à cette querelle? L'évolution de l'historiographie moderne, en particulier le linguistic turn, qui a insisté sur l'aspect narratif de toute histoire, doit-il le porter à réhabiliter le chroniqueur? Ne faudrait-il pas tout autant comprendre la démarche de l'un et de l'autre des protagonistes pour les voir tous deux, malgré leur statut d'écrivains de l'histoire, comme des sujets, des témoins de l'histoire et de leur époque? Godefroid Kurth, a methodological and rigorous historian from the beginning of the twentieth century, and Jean d'Outremeuse, prolix but disorganized chronicler from the fourteenth century, seem to share the same « profession », that of historian. Between the two, however, stands a gaping abyss due to two visions of history totally opposed. For the first one, history is made of positive events, rebuilt by a meticulous study of the sources. For the second one, history is a well of anecdotes useful to interest an audience : it is built with legends, personal inventions, whose aim is to create plausibility as well as a true historical narr~<br>

Abstract: The textual structure of the Titurel-fragments is a challenge to both narratology and the theory of lyric poetry. The article proposes a model of interpretation that implies a transgression of narratological approaches. It is based on the assumption that there is an essential relationship between narrative and lyrical concepts of time. The Titurel-fragments do not only show the transgression from lyrical narrative to narrative poetry but indicate the conditions of this process: lyrical presence can only emerge on the basis of a previous narrative interpretation of time. The fragments show on different textual levels how the poetic transgression of the narrative time concept can be achieved. The paradigmatic relationship of love and death in the first fragment reveals that the meaning of a story actually reaches beyond the oppositions that underlie the story-logic. The second fragment demonstrates the analogy between the use of metaphors in the story and the mediality of its narration: The notions of writing and semantic difference are sublated by a kind of sound logic that has to be recognized as a basic semantic nexus.<br>

Abstract: Quelle forme de pluralisme permet une démocratie viable ? Y a-t-il compatibilité entre deux types de principes et de pratiques ? Après avoir éclairci les concepts de pluralisme, pluralisme culturel, pluralisme moral et démocratie, l'article analyse les dilemmes auxquels conduisent les visions abstraites du pluralisme culturel et de la démocratie dans le contexte contemporain en montrant la symétrie du dilemme de l'homme démocratique et du dilemme du croyant. L'examen des racines sociologiques du nouveau pluralisme culturel dans la « société inconnue » conduit à l'analyse des difficultés rencontrées par la constitution d'un « nous » politique qui ne peut pas seulement dépendre d'un code « fin » et procédural. Le rejet du pluralisme radical n'est pas le résultat d'un diktat philosophique ou sociologique mais d'une analyse contextuelle et d'une démarche prudentielle tenant compte des situations historiques et politiques concrètes. What kind of pluralism allows a viable democracy ? Are the two types of principles and practices compatible? After clarifying the concepts of pluralism, cultural pluralism, moral pluralism and democracy, the article analyzes the dilemmas posed by the abstract visions of cultural pluralism and democracy in the contemporary world, showing the symmetry between the dilemmas of the democrat and those of the believer. The examination of the sociological roots of the new cultural pluralism in the « unknown society » leads to an analysis of the difficulties of creating a political « us » which does not depend only on some teleological and procedural code. The rejection of radical pluralism is not the result of some philosophical or sociological dictum ; it emerges from a contextual analysis and a careful procedure which takes account of historical situations and concrete policies.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Author(s): Briggs Kate<br>
Abstract: This article argues for a definition of translation as a form of writing under constraint. Quite straightforwardly, the translator must write the original text again in a language other than the one in which it was originally composed. Both inhibiting and enabling, that restriction is also translation's resource, ensuring its distinctiveness as a writing practice and providing the key to its unique transformative possibilities. Like lipogrammatical writing, translation is inaugurated by its constraint. The article explores the affinity between translation and the lipogram with reference to Georges Perec's La Disparition, where the prohibition of the letter e initiates a peculiarly inventive kind of writing. Peculiarly inventive, because the effects generated by writing without a given letter of the alphabet, or by writing a given text again in another, altogether different, language, are essentially unprogrammable: we do not know what is going to happen.<br>

Abstract: The article explores how, given the absence of a proper public sphere, twentieth-century Hungarian social research began to use the notion of "reality" in populist socio-reports, the documentary films of the 1970s, and sociological debates. These discussions all shared the assumption that contemporary political elites ignored the "real" conditions of society. Thus it was the duty of social research (socio-reports or sociology proper) to reveal these facts in a manner that was free of ideology. Whereas in North America and Western Europe during the 1960s and 1970s the notion of a directly accessible "reality" had been thrown into question, in Hungary scholarship insisted on this kind of cognitive realism because of social and political reasons. As they argued, "reality" was to be interpreted not as a universal epistemological category, but according to particular terms of the sociology of knowledge. This article explores how the detection of "reality" and "facts" became an ethical vocation within these interrogatory frameworks.<br>

Abstract: Laying down as a theorical narratologic principle that history has never taken the shape of an actual experience, but was untili today a mere narrative representation, the author aims at following the evolution of the relation between literary shapes and historical past in the Polish literature after the Second World War. From 1945 onwards history does not appear any more as a kind of strategical staging; instead it becomes an attempt to live an immediate experience regardless of any intellectual reconstruction. Otherwise, instrumentalisation and ideological recovery of the past lead the Polish writers to a real denial of history thanks to (self) parodical literary forms. Finally the multiplication of autobiographical works means a new attack against the traditional historical novel. Thus, thanks to this triple strategy which leads to a dismantling of history consistent with the now prevailing bursting of narrative forms, Polish literature brings its own answer to the history crisis which is to be seen nowadays in the western literature.<br>

Author(s): PAILLER Jean-Marie<br>
Abstract: L'âne des Métamorphoses d'Apulée est à la fois objet, vecteur et témoin de nombreuses activités commerciales de proximité. Le héros Lucius, avant sa transformation, est une figure représentative d'un autre commerce : celui qui s'exerce à grande échelle, fait appel au relais de manieurs d'argent, dépend de la prospérité de la navigation en Méditerranée. La structure d'ensemble du roman met en valeur la confrontation entre ces deux univers, mais aussi les relations qu'ils entretiennent. Apulée établit une série d'étroites correspondances, un véritable réseau métaphorique entre les déplacements et transformations qui sont de l'essence du commerce, d'une part, et d'autre part la série des métamorphoses qui forment l'objet avoué du récit. The donkey in Apuleius' Metamorphoses is at the same time the object, vector and witness to a number of short distance commercial activities. Lucius, the hero, before his transformation is a representative figure of another kind of commerce: a wide-scale operation calling on money changers as relays and depending on a thriving navigation in the Mediterranean. The overall structure of the novel sets into relief the confrontation between those two worlds but also the relationships they entertain. Apuleius set up a series of close correspondences, a real metaphorical network between the journeys and the transformations which are of the essence of commerce on one hand and on the other hand the series of metamorphoses which are the overt object of the narrative.<br>

Author(s): BALLABRIGA ALAIN<br>
Abstract: On semble considérer d'ordinaire que, dans les Travaux et les jours d'Hésiode, les deux grands mythes successifs de Prométhée et des races sont deux vieux mythes de même nature. On peut montrer pourtant que le mythe des races est en fait une sorte de révision critique du mythe de Prométhée, tout comme, dans la Bible, le premier récit de la Genèse doit être situé par rapport au deuxième, plus archaïque. Cette démarche comparative permet de voir dans le caractère créatif et critique de la pensée mythique une donnée anthropologique assez générale, longtemps minimisée par les approches structuralistes. The two great successive myths in Hesiod's Works and Days — the myth of Prometheus and the myth of Ages — are usually seen as two old myths of the same nature. However, it is possible to show that the myth of Ages is actually a kind of critical reassessment of the myth of Prometheus, just as in the Bible, the first narrative of Genesis must be placed in relation to the second one, which is more archaic. Thanks to this comparative proceeding, the creative and critical nature of mythical thought will appear as a fairly general anthropological fact, long minimized by the structuralist approach.<br>

Author(s): van PEER WILLIE<br>
Abstract: Focusing on the difference between traditional hermeneutics and more scientifically oriented approaches to literature, this essay argues that our understanding of currently debated issues—such as whether a canon should and/or can be abolished—is significantly increased if one formulates nomological theories that can be empirically tested. To stimulate further research of this kind, two "laws" of literary history are proposed.<br>

Publisher: Sameeksha Trust<br>
Issue: i397690<br>
Date: 3 21, 1976<br>
Author(s): WittgensteinAbstract: At the beginning of this decade, newspapers the world over reported the UN general assembly's declaration of the last segment of the 20th century as the International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), beginning January 1, 1990. There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.<br>

Abstract: This paper analyzes the kind of historical understanding presupposed in the writing of classical Chinese Ch'an Buddhist "transmission" narratives and places this historical understanding into comparative juxtaposition with modern Western historiographic practice. It finds that fundamental to Chinese Ch'an historical awareness are genealogical metaphors structuring historical time and meaning in terms of generations of family relations and the practices of inheritance. These metaphors link the Ch'an historian to the texts of historical study in ways that contrast with the posture of modern historians. The essay outlines four basic differences between the self-understanding presupposed in Ch'an Buddhist historical writing and that assumed in modern historical research and concludes by suggesting how contemporary historical thinking might benefit from reflecting on these differences.<br>

Publisher: SAGE<br>
Issue: i40178171<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Merriman Peter<br>
Abstract: What makes the figure of the passenger distinctive as both a subject and an object of mobility and transportation systems? What distinguishes the passenger from other mobile subjectivities, from nomad, flaneur to consumer? How is the passenger represented, practiced and performed? How has the passenger and their experiences been conceived, imagined, manipulated, regulated and engineered? And what kind of human-technology assemblages do passengers enact? Through four short perspectives, this paper seeks to 'profile' the passenger as a distinctive historical and conceptual figure that can help to add greater precision to the analysis of our mobile ways of life. The passenger is explored as an object of speculative theoretical debate, a figure entangled in a host of identities, practices, performances and contexts, and an important way to illuminate key conceptual problematics, from representation to embodiment.<br>

Abstract: The works of Lewis and Girard share several central interests but seem divided by opposite views of myth. Lewis' novelistic retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, however, provides a bridge: it depicts an ancient society organized around sacrifice and myth as understood in Girard's cultural theory and tells a Girardian story of conversion, in which the narrator discovers the imitative and rivalrous nature of her desire. Her rivalry and reconciliation with the story's true god carries the novel beyond Girardian myth to a contrary kind of narrative identified with fairy stories, which can extend Girard's approach to Christian conversion.<br>

Abstract: Metaphor, Vibration and Form identifies a process that underlies all ritual enactments. Whether it is Joseph Campbell's analysis of the Hero's journey, Victor Turner's theoretical and experiential interest in symbols, or Charles Laughlin's cycle of meaning, there is at work a particular kind of behavioral transformation system. It begins with the mind and the meanings provided metaphorically for symbols, then proceeds to an intense focus on symbolic sequences in meditation or in ritual dramas, so that the metaphor is taken into the body as physical experience. From this physical "ownership" of the metaphor, the properties associated with it are encouraged, socially and ritually, to come to the surface and be enacted in the form of everyday behavior. Questions of symbolic appropriation, the redundancy of symbol, and professional responsibility are addressed in the concluding remarks.<br>

Abstract: A quelles conditions la théologie peut-elle se fonder comme théologie interprétative selon le vœu de Claude Geffré (La théologie au risque de l'interprétation) et d'Eberhard, Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Réponse: elle doit demander concepts et méthode à une philosophie de l'interprétation. Pour surmonter la « crise de la métaphysique » (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; ensuite pour fixer les principes de l'interprétation, garantissant l'historicité, la transcendance personnalisée et l'Amour de Dieu. Si une herméneutique (de Dilthey à Gadamer et à Ricœur) n'y suffit point, l'A. renvoie à sa proposition philosophique de « l'Inlégralisme » (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du monde), avec sa théorie de l'Intégral et du transréel, son analytique de la praxis sociale et son anthropologie « égotiste ». Under what kind of conditions can a theology be founded as an interpretative one, as suggested by Claude Geffré (La Théologie au risque de l'interprétation) and Eberhard Jüngel (Dieu mystère du monde) ? Answer: it is obliged to demand concepts and method from a philosophy of the interpretation. In order to overcome the "crisis of metaphysics" (Nietzsche, Heidegger) ; in order to determine the principles of the interpretation, which are able to guarantee the historicity, the personalized transcendency and the Love of God. If a hermeneutics (from Dilthey to Gadamer and Ricœur) is not enough, the author refers to his philosophical proposition of "integralism" (cf. J. Granier, Le discours du mondes), with its theory of the Integral and of Transreal, its analytics of the social praxis and its "egotistic" anthropology.<br>

Author(s): On-Cho Ng Sheldon<br>
Abstract: Textures of Time is a rich and challenging book that raises a host of important and hard questions about historical narrative, form, and style; the sociology of texts; and the core problem of ascertaining historical truth. Two that pertain to the book's main claims are of special interest to nonspecialist readers: Is register or style - "texture" - necessarily and everywhere diagnostic of "history"? Does a new kind of "historical consciousness" emerge in south India beginning in the sixteenth century, indeed as a sign of an Indian early modernity? Textures is not the first book to argue that historical discourse is constitutively marked by a peculiar style, but the claim is beset by difficulties that scholars since Barthes have detailed. Rather than textures of time - accounts of what really happened in history-what these works offer us may be only pretextures of time, textualized forms of a human experience that make claims about its degrees and types of truth through representations of various states of temporality. Instead of assessing, then, whether these works are history or something else like "myth," we might ask whether they invite us to transcend this very dichotomy, to try, that is, to make sense of historical forms of consciousness rather than to identify forms of historical consciousness. As for modernity, nothing in south Indian historiography from 1500-1800 remotely compares to the conceptual revolution of Europe. But why should we expect the newness of the early modern world to have been experienced the same way everywhere? Modernity across Asia may have shown simultaneity without symmetry. Should this asymmetry turn out to reveal continuity and not rupture, however, no need to lament the fact. There is no shame in premodernity.<br>

Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Author(s): Wolpe Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Recent changes within social and cultural anthropology have made history a key issue, but in this essay I argue that the field has yet to develop the resources that are required to deal with temporality. This point is made through an extended examination of Jean and John Comaroff's work on Christianity and colonialism in southern Africa. Arguably, the Comaroffs read history backward and then present its unfolding as a kind of inexorable logic. In doing so, they homogenize missionary and Tswana "cultures" and attribute agency to abstractions rather than to people acting in particular material contexts. In contrast, I argue for a narrative approach to historical anthropological explanation. The emergent qualities of events - and the variable ways in which capitalism, hegemony, Protestantism, and vernacular modernisms relate - require narrative for explanation, narrative that encompasses within itself the narratives of social actors themselves.<br>

Abstract: A conflict is a relational space in crisis in which the antagonists determine, in an interactive dynamic, what is at stake. As the negotiation goes by, ego states his truth line, while alter builds his offensive line based on a truth that becomes reality. Defending one’s truth means also fighting for one’s integrity; in other words, defining my truth is also giving a structure to my integrity, to my own self. If the literature of the I has frequently conflicts in its pages, it is probably because the reading pact is tied up to the truth. But making a narrative of the self out of the configuration system can also get the text in another kind of conflict where the frontiers of the diegetic levels become more and more permeable. Despite everything, the illocutary power in autobiographic literature, seems to change the way the « I » sees himself, and gives him a new ethos that suits him fine.<br>

Abstract: See the classic study,
         Barnes DR, Britton JN and Torbe M (1989) Language, the Learner, and the School. Portsmouth, NH: Boynton/Cook. It argues that stress on ‘proper English’ can inhibit non-middle-class children from expressing themselves in the kind of language they use at home, while ‘learning’ for all too many students means guessing what answers the teacher expects – in ‘school language’ of course. The final section makes important recommendations on the major issue of language across the curriculum – what sort of language is really appropriate in multicultural schools? A charismatic evangelical teacher-training student I supervised some years ago was convinced that modern teenagers can understand Christian doctrine if only the teacher can find the right teaching methods including exciting visual aids. He admitted failure having tried.<br>

Author(s): Macdonald Helen M.<br>
Abstract: This paper emerges out of an ethnographic study conducted at the University of Cape Town that explored the dynamics of an intervention providing a ‘safe space’ for university staff to engage in alternative ways with South Africa's apartheid past, the university's institutional culture and with each other. This paper focuses on the social politics that arose between the intervention, its participants and imagined non-participants in relation to the university's ‘transformation’ vision. The interventionist intention was reworked by participants at a ground level into key symbols by which participants shaped the patterns of their behaviours and gave meaning to their experiences. Utilising Ortner's (1973) model for recognising and using key symbols, I argue that ‘transformation’ and ‘safe space’ are
         elaboratingsymbols in that they have conceptual and action elaborating power. These elaborating symbols operate in relay with a kind of logic that ‘crystallises commitment’ from participants to the intervention in an emotionally powerful and relatively undifferentiated manner. In so doing, they render the intervention a ‘summarising’ symbol capable of expressing what their experience means to them as an imagined community in relation to others.<br>

Abstract: In a similar critique of language and consumerism, in
         Whole Foods, Marie Buck playfully fuses language from the company's website, an anarchist zine, and etymological dictionaries, so that “the hybrid form ofWhole Foodscontrasts with the grocer's rhetoric of uncorrupted organic wholeness and natural unmediated authenticity.”
               Her poems play on culinary exoticism and the branding and marketing of food products to indicate privilege and access: “Cheeses often reflect the character of their country of origin, so experimenting with different cheese can be a kind of exploration of a faraway place” (“Cheese”).118
            
               In one poem titled “Authenticity,” Buck incorporates what appear to be instructions for caring for fruit with intimations about the process of poetic making: “Cutting and exposure to the air darkens the flesh. We stood in unheated squats having tooth and not being limp. We were more art than science. We gently rubbed our skin in a circular motion.”119
            
               The process of slicing and selecting brings about a transformation that is “more art than science” in this self-reflective poem. But more immediately, “Authenticity” also calls to mind the exposé concerning Whole Foods cofounder John P. Mackey, who used a pseudonym to post more than 1,100 entries about his own company on Yahoo! Finance bulletin boards between 1999 and 2006. The food mogul's posts were often self-serving: “I like Mackey's haircut. I think he looks cute,” one 28 April 2000 post read. “You must not patronize any of WFMI's stores. Tattoos, piercings, unusual dress and interesting haircuts are everywhere in the stores. In comparison, Mackey looks like a model for Brooks Brothers!”120
            
               The hypertrophied falseness of the supermarket comes to a head in Mackey's (im)posturing.121<br>

Abstract: Having just devoted a chapter to “Derrida's Theologies of Translation” (228–46), Apter follows this list with a further exegesis of Derrida's seminal role in highlighting the issue of translation in deconstructive thought (249–53). She then moves on to discuss Abdelfattah Kilito's elegantly ironic book Lan tatakallana lughati (Thou Shalt Not Speak My Language Syracuse, 2006)—a work whose linguistic interdiction hasn't prevented it from receiving rapid translations into French and English—before closing the chapter with further comments on Derrida. It is refreshing finally to find some discussion of a theorist based outside Paris or the United States, and yet like many Moroccan intellectuals, Kilito does much of his critical writing in French, appearing in such journals as
      Poétique; he recently published in Paris a kind of sequel to his 2002 volume,Je parle toutes les langues, mais en arabe(Actes Sud, 2013). In discussing the work of a Moroccan theorist who holds a PhD from the Sorbonne, recipient in 1996 of the Prix du rayonnement de la langue française of the Académie Française, Apter has not moved so far from the Rive Gauche after all.<br>

Abstract: This cinematic form of motion is also present in the scene in which Nick sees Gatsby for the first time. It is can be seen as a pan shot, where the cat's movement reinforces the horizontal movement of Nick's head (Kundu 37): “The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone” (20). This movement is continued through Gatsby's stretching out his arms towards the sea: “I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light” (21). Similarly, Berman identifies this scene as “intensively cinematic” in not only its movements but also its staging, lightning, and framing (151–52). Its romantic allure to the audience is due to the reader being a “silent witness” to Gatsby's trembling arms (Berman 152). These “tracking shots” and their cinematic quality create the kind of motion that engages and draws the reader into the textual world. This further establishes an envisioning, a participation in the action of the first part of the book, which reinforces the textual hyper-memory.<br>

Abstract: In an interview with Melissa Beattie-Moss, Jabbeh Wesley lamented the virtual nonexistence of significant literary figures in Liberia, writers who could be compared with those in Nigeria, Kenya, or other regions of Africa. But even those African writers understandably wrote about their own experiences, which were based on their confrontations with colonialism. Those who could be identified as her literary forebears in Liberia were mostly Americo-Liberians whose writing was a kind “settler d of literature, with American images, written in isolation of the environment and culture of Africa.” Sadly, her people, “the so-called elite, educated ones—frowned on anything African for a long time,” so in effect, she had no established literary figure to look up to (Beattie-Moss). Jabbeh Wesley has reluctantly accepted the honor of being the first truly Liberian literary figure—at least, one with an international profile.
         
               I am in no way making Jabbeh Wesley the Chinua Achebe of Liberian literature, nor does she claim to be. She acknowledges that she has benefited considerably from the many griots and oral narrators of her culture. But she is a pioneer; her four poetry collections address themes of war, love, globalization, feminism, African renaissance, diaspora identity, and much more.4<br>

Abstract: There was always the temptation to give up the tension created by the difference between the two modes of being in the world. From the side of African and other diaspora communities, there is always the utopian temptation to create a world of meaning only from resources that they define as original or “indigenous.” Such a position would represent a kind of mimicry of the Europeans who think that their cultures have never learned from or been dependent on others. It is furthermore almost impossible to designate any “pure” beginnings in any part of the world. It is at this point that I return to V. Y. Mudimbe's notion of gnosis. He makes it clear that by gnosis he is not referring to an episteme or a science. For me this indicates a lived or performed appearance—in other words, a mode of life where practice is to the fore but the theoretical implications of this practice act as critical principles. These principles allow room for the meaning of the practice to engage in all the implications of creating a world of meaning. This would be close to what goes on in religious communities.<br>

Abstract: But just the other day I got a kind of Rip van Winkle testimony from my friend Dick Howard, of Stony Brook, who apparently hasn't attended SPEP since the twenty-fifth anniversary meeting in Toronto. He's here for a panel tomorrow, and he sent me an e-mail, from which I quote, in part, with permission: “Just have been looking at SPEP program—it's extraordinary how it's grown and the diversity of things going on there. A ‘victory’ that at the same time comes with a diversification that perhaps gives more breath than depth? History will judge.” So there you have it! The judgment of history! SPEP flourishes today, a major force in American philosophy, and its “victory” seems to justify and redeem in retrospect all those early struggles, the slaughter bench of the early days, the courage and prescience of that small band of outsiders and oddballs. It makes a good story, as history always should: the triumph of the little guys over enormous odds. In Hegelian terms, reason exercised its cunning and brought about results unforeseeable, almost unimaginable, in those far-off days of 1962—or was it 1961? In philosophical terms, history has rendered its judgment.<br>

Abstract: In relation to these frustrating circumstances, however, I benefited in still another way from the early SPEP meetings. Had I been simply caught between my friends and teachers at Illinois and Northwestern, on the one hand, and the larger hostile culture of the philosophical mainstream, on the other, I might well have chosen a career of either speaking mostly to my own kind or becoming a professional critic. But in the diversity of those early meetings, I also found that it was hard to define just what “my own kind” was supposed to be. For me, an important fact about our theoretically underorganized little band is that we ourselves sometimes seemed only marginally better than the tradition at putting our passions into proper words. The difference, of course, is that many of us knew this. The fact that we continued to compromise our own efforts to be phenomenological simply encouraged us to be more phenomenological.<br>

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: It is perhaps no coincidence, then, that the word
      responsibilityfirst appears in these juridical writings at the very same time that Kant produces his most powerful articulations of the metaphysics of morals in which he reconciles morals and politics through a kind of strict moral bookkeeping based on the principle of equality contained in the notion oflex talionis, or justice as retribution. Although lex talionis also takes us back to the Judeo-Christian doctrine of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth found in the Old Testament, and ultimately Kant, too, grounds its absolute authority on the benevolence of a rational God, Kant is clear that the retaliation required by the law of talionis cannot be based on revenge but, rather, must be based on equality. The word that Kant uses for equality isGleichheit, which also connotes likeness. To be fair, the punishment must fit the crime in the sense of like for like. In both his moral theory and his political theory, Kant insists on the connection between freedom and equality. Moreover, as we know, he maintains that morality requires that we do our duty for its own sake and not from inclinations or emotions alone. To spite the fact that Kant explicitly opposes to the mechanisms of nature the freedom that he claims warrants human dignity, Nietzsche criticizes Kant's “economic justification of virtue,” which makes morality a matter of mechanically following laws (Nietzsche2003, 176; cf., e.g., Kant1795, 340–41).<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.
            
                  It perhaps is to be found first in Leibniz and then in the formulation in C. S. Pierce and John M. E. McTaggart, but I will share Roderick Chisholm's version of it with you.32
               
                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Critical theory is a metaphor for a certain kind of theoretical orientation which owes its origin to Kant, Hegel and Marx, its systematization to Horkheimer and his associates at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt, and its development to successors, particularly to a group led by Jürgen Habermas, who have sustained it under various renditions to the present day. As a term, critical theory is both general and specific. In general it refers to that critical element in German philosophy, which began with Hegel's critique of Kant. More specifically it is associated with a certain orientation toward philosophy, which found its twentieth-century expression in Frankfurt.

Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: This statement expresses a postmodern perspective more effectively than such concepts as deconstruction, death of God, poststructuralism, or genealogical thought. By virtue of is vagueness it articulates the absence of a defining subject, mastering terms, or a foundation for thought. It privileges varieties of approach and subject matter that destabilize each other and avoids a definitive framework that would guide the organization. Instead it offers SPEP as an open space for incompatible as well as compatible types of knowledge, approach, and philosophical sensibility. It affirms an indeterminate ambiguity in all words that people might otherwise interpret as centralizing and directive in an exclusive way. I believe that it reflects a kind of democratic pluralism rather more than the philosophical traditions could tolerate that came from Europe and played defining roles in SPEP's early years. I am quite sure that some of the organization's early leaders would consider the mission statement no less nihilistic than they found Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida, Foucault, and all other philosophers identified as postmodern in 1980.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Interestingly, we have reached a curious state of déjà vu. If SPEP was very much the work of John Wild, and if Wild followed a trajectory from realism to phenomenology, we are today seeing a movement in reverse, from phenomenology back to realism. Furthermore the later theological turn, almost predictable from the implicit theological beginnings of Continental philosophy, has occasioned a turn toward an antireligion, toward a new atheism, a new modernism, and a new materialism, reminiscent of the debates about scientific realism when Wilfrid Sellars presented his views on the manifest image and the scientific image in the early years of SPEP. The new movement has gathered around Quentin Meillassoux's
            After Finitude.
                  Meillassoux, a student of Badiou's, makes two charges. First is “correlationism”: Continental philosophy from Kant to the present is inherently subjectivistic and antirealist and makes nonsense of modern science (the premise that provoked the Alan Sokal ruse).26
               
                  The villain of the piece is Kant's perversion of the Copernican Revolution, wherein Kant reinstated the very anthropocentrism destroyed by Copernicus. Second is “fideism”: when Kant said that he found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith, he laid the ground for the theological turn. He invented the God of the gaps. He turned philosophy into a kind of apologetics that delimits the natural sciences and leaves the barn door wide open, through which theology makes an easy escape. Phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction are just so many versions of Kantian idealism under another name, constituting the dark damp soil in which the poisonous mushrooms of theology take root. If the theological turn is where Continental philosophy leads us, the young critics seem to say, that is the last straw, its reductio ad absurdum!27<br>

Abstract: This volume of articles contains highlights from the fifty-second annual meeting of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP). The University of Oregon hosted our conference on October 24–26, 2013. All three of the plenary sessions for this conference constituted reflections on limits of various kinds: the limits of conceptual thinking, the limits of continental philosophy understood as a kind of post-Kantian quasi-transcendental enterprise, and the idea that SPEP's guiding orientation is an openness to experience that requires the Society to push against its own limits continually, to edge beyond itself. This common thread of reflection on limits has inspired the title of this volume: “Philosophy at/of the Limit.”<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: More than a simple and obvious trope, hyperbole is a perspective that allows one to view the world otherwise through the use of excess and exaggeration. It is a mode of thought, a practice of excess, and an act of becoming. It can operate discursively, polemically, prophetically, paradoxically, and philosophically. It is a generator of meaning and being and a lens through which to view the world and the limits of knowledge differently. It is a disruptive force within language that always attempts to move beyond the insufficiency of thought and language while at the same time revealing the errant multiplicity and exorbitance of discourse through the abundance of excess. Hyperbole is a different kind of speech; through it a lie that is not a deception can be employed on the side of truth(s), which is always lacking and unstable, necessitating the abundance of excess.<br>

Abstract: Ricoeur, however, does not view the movement from mimesis
      3to mimesis1as arhetoricalmoment. He employs rhetorical terminology as he discusses the techniques that the actual (as opposed to implied) author of a text utilizes in order to conceal “the violence … in the strategy of persuasion” (1988, 3:162). But he abandons this vocabulary when he approaches the reader, opting instead for the language of phenomenology and aesthetics (1988, 3:166–67). In part, he discards the language of the rhetorical tradition because of his limited view of rhetoric's capacity to produce real change in the world. He privileges poetics and philosophy “ontologically” over rhetoric, as Michael Leff has rightly pointed out (1987, 60). Ricoeur valorizes these intellectual traditions according to their ends: poetry results in a cathartic moment that purges old emotions and makes way for new ones, whereas rhetoric results in a persuasive moment that merely crystallizes the preexisting opinions of the audience. According to Ricoeur, these two ends are starkly opposed to one another: “Catharsis must, finally, be opposed to persuasion.” Unlike “all seduction or flattery” (i.e., rhetoric), catharsis stirs the emotions in order to enable “the creative imitation of human action” (1997, 66; see also 1977, 35). However, in the third volume ofTime and Narrative, Ricoeur also admits that the set of effects attached to catharsis is “complex”: “It designates first of all the effect of the work that is more moral than aesthetic: new evaluations, hitherto unheard of norms, are proposed by the work, confronting or shaking current customs” (1988 3:176). Because catharsis possesses a moral component, Ricoeur reasons, it is capable of instructing. Many rhetorical scholars would likely take issue with his assigning such seemingly “persuasive” effects to the realm of poetics rather than rhetoric. Does not Aristotle say that the stirring of emotions is as essential as logical argument to persuasion and judgm~<br>

Abstract: Along the same lines, in the preface to
      Man and Superman, he draws a distinction between two states of corporeal infirmity. The first, what he calls “the true joy of life,” results from “the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap, the being a force of nature.” The second is engendered by a failure of will and perspective, producing “a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.”
            Scholars and biographers have taken both views of Shaw. Countless testimonies of friends and acquaintances as well as innumerable pronouncements by GBS himself laud the extraordinary vibrancy of the “active young revolutionist” following his typical schedule of prolific writing and speech giving.22
         
            At the same time, Shaw's private diaries are replete with meticulous physiological self-examination, documenting his crippling headaches as well as myriad illnesses, injuries, changes in weight and appetite, and suspected symptoms. Robert Brustein attributes “a kind of Swiftian disgust at the human body and its functions” to the playwright, while Sally Peters pathologizes his interest in health, arguing its origin in latent psychosis, specifically an obsessive fear of contagion.23
         
            His commitment to vegetarianism, teetotalism, and Jaegerism, she argues, was founded as much upon hygienic paranoia as moral principle: “Fueled by a “desperate revulsion from body and biology[,] … Shaw's was an ever-lasting defense against dirt, poison, and contamination[,] whatever symbolized to him the form-destroying potencies of existence.”24
         
            In any case, the vexed body, on its way to evolutionary elimination, assiduously preoccupied Shaw, and matters of personal and public wellness remained an idée fixe until the end of his life.25<br>

Abstract: Furthermore, like Ricoeur, Shaw rejects the Pauline concepts of original sin and vicarious atonement. We enter the world spotless, Shaw believes, and no gentleman—Shaw's shorthand for the virtuous person, male or female—would ever allow an innocent other to pay for her misdeeds. The crux is not to ignorantly transgress to the heart's content and then brazenly appeal to a sacrificial scapegoat to wash away the dirt with unblemished blood and tears. Rather, as Jesus proclaims, the recalcitrant should have a change of heart and sin no more. For Shaw, “Christ stands in the world for that intuition of the highest humanity that we, being members of one another, must not complain, must not scold, must not strike, nor revile nor persecute nor revenge nor punish.”
         
               What most intrigues and inspires Shaw about Jesus is not his purported special status in the cosmic order among adherents of traditional Christianity, but the type of person he embodies in the flesh. Thus, he is, as Ricoeur views him, a paradigmatic metaphor, a timeless “intuition” in the Shavian lexicon, of precisely the kind of exemplary individual Shaw believes every child has the capacity to become in its maturity: a reverent adult who heeds Micah's (6:8)44
            
               admonition to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God.45
            
               In Shaw's (as well as Ricoeur's) eyes, there is no means of remedying the world's ills other than discovering practical and compassionate ways of implementing politically the core of Jesus's message, which he takes to be the basic principles of Fabian socialism.46

Abstract: In the essay I adopt Tamar Yacobi's “communication model” for settling discrepancies and inconsistencies in fictional texts and use it to demonstrate that the hypothesis of unreliable narration does not necessarily entail only one kind of interpretation. To support this point, I offer the distinction between
         self-deceptiveandother-deceptivenarrating characters, and I argue that some texts constantly cause the reader to hesitate between conflicting interpretations of the narrator as belonging to one of these two types. Such equivocation on the part of the reader is then extended to competing interpretations of the text, in accordance with each type of narrator. The chosen novel for this purpose is Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Setting aside for a moment the tendency of relativism (or extreme subjectivity) to enervate leaps toward the possible-impossible (of Henri Lefebvre's Utopia in the positive), in contemporary social and political thought (identified by David Harvey as leading—by way of its uncertainty—to a nonproductive “both/and” cul-de-sac),
         Utopiaanddystopiareally cannot be interchangeable, as their aims are diametrically opposed. Even when the sense thatdystopiais the opposite ofUtopiapersists in definitions of the two terms, common usage tends to muddy the affair. In common parlance, the move is from difference to a conception of dystopia as “inverted Utopia” and from there to a kind of interchangeability between them: “a strand of utopianism or dystopianism,” as one writer put it, suggesting their indivisibility.
               Conjoining the two terms establishes a “both/and” condition and at best promises only confusion or at worst presupposes failure. If the first drains Utopia of its oppositional (or critical) dimension, the second asserts that Utopia is always already dystopia, no matter how initially attractive its proposition. In contrast, it would be more productive to maintain the “either/or” divide (arrived at dialectically) argued for by Harvey in19
            Spaces of Hope(2000). Only by making a deliberate decision between alternatives, that is, only when one option is cut off, can life be promised to the other. It is no wonder, then, that the verbto decidecarries within its very meaning a sense of necessary certainty, and judgment as well.<br>
