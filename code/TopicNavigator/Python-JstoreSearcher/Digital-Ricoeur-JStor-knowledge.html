  Author(s) Ell Theodore<br>
  Abstract: In the preceding chapter we considered the possibility of a non-sacrificial knowledge and, even if with many caveats, we resolved that question in the affirmative. There is still one dimension of Girard’s mimetic theory, however, that in our journey through the history of the relationship between philosophy and religion we have not yet adequately examined: the “apocalyptic” dimension.<br>

  Book Title: Nosotros-A Study of Everyday Meanings in Hispano New Mexico<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): KORTE ALVIN O.<br>
  Abstract: Much knowledge and understanding can be generated from the experiences of everyday life. In this engaging study, Alvin O. Korte examines how this concept applies to Spanish-speaking peoples adapted to a particular locale, specifically the Hispanos and Hispanas of northern New Mexico. Drawing on social philosopher Alfred Schutz's theory of typification, Korte looks at how meaning and identity are crafted by quotidian activities. Incorporating phenomenological and ethnomethodological strategies, the author investigates several aspects of local Hispano culture, including the oral tradition, leave-taking, death and remembrances of the dead, spirituality, and the circle of life. Although avoiding a social-problems approach, the book devotes necessary attention to

  Book Title: The Thought of Music-  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Kramer Lawrence<br>
  Abstract: What, exactly, is knowledge of music? And what does it tell us about humanistic knowledge in general?
      The Thought of Musicgrapples directly with these fundamental questions-questions especially compelling at a time when humanistic knowledge is enmeshed in debates about its character and future. In this third volume in a trilogy on musical understanding that includesInterpreting MusicandExpression and Truth, Lawrence Kramer seeks answers in both thoughtaboutmusic and thoughtinmusic-thinking in tones. He skillfully assesses musical scholarship in the aftermath of critical musicology and musical hermeneutics and in view of more recent concerns with embodiment, affect, and performance. This authoritative and timely work challenges the prevailing conceptions of every topic it addresses: language, context, and culture; pleasure and performance; and, through music, the foundations of understanding in the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: We have now come to a threshold. Regardless of whether the preceding chapters have examined musical knowledge via concepts, language, or sensation, the knowledge proposed has always been culturally inflected. What else could it have been? Musical knowledge is cultural knowledge. That is so virtually by definition. Or it would be, if we could somehow stabilize the protean term
                  culture. Culture is something—a word, an idea, a metaphor—that we cannot seem to do without but that we always ask to do too much work for us. For present purposes, the term may be taken to denote the loose<br>

  Abstract: In considering languages of grief in relation to languages of certainty, there is a tension in the ways death can be thought of in connection to modern knowledge. On the one hand, we can consider death as that which underlies the possibility of knowledge, as that end point to the fostering or disallowing of life that stands for the modern configuration of power/knowledge (as Foucault [1978] had it). And on the other hand, we can imagine death as that which cannot be spoken in languages of modernity (as de Certeau [1986] suggested). Put differently, this is the distinction between death<br>

  Abstract: Not so long ago the question would never have come up. Musicology was self-validating. It was grounded in a fixed conception of Western identity that it also helped perpetuate. Like the music it studied, primarily Western art music, it served the values of the humanistic tradition embodied in both the modern university and the high culture of a great civilization. It accumulated knowledge for deposit in a stable cultural archive that could support continuities of practice and understanding across time.

  Abstract: As anthropologists rush to salvage culture in the wake of an increasingly biologized and globally homogenized psychiatry, they are focusing anew on phenomenology and the subjective experience of people afflicted with the anomalous states, feelings, and cognition of madness. But recent studies suggest that, in the Western settings in which psychiatry evolved, the cultural, macrosocial, and microsocial underpinnings of severe psychiatric conditions cannot so easily be separated from psychiatric knowledge. The comparative method of cross-cultural research, useful in uncovering the cultural dimension of psychiatric conditions outside the realm of biomedicine and Western psychiatry, is less helpful for recognizing the work<br>

  Abstract: One of the most extraordinary and yet obscure currents in the intellectual history of the Renaissance was the interest of Christian thinkers in the Jewish cabala. This concern extended from Pico’s attempt to absorb cabala into a Christian synthesis of universal knowledge at the end of the fifteenth century well into the seventeenth, and included writers and scholars from every major European country. Yet, in spite of the wide distribution of cabalistic interest in both time and space, the problem of explaining the movement, in the sense of relating it to the general concerns of its historical setting, has not<br>

  Book Title: Being There-The Fieldwork Encounter and the Making of Truth<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Hammoudi Abdellah<br>
  Abstract: Challenges to ethnographic authority and to the ethics of representation have led many contemporary anthropologists to abandon fieldwork in favor of strategies of theoretical puppeteering, textual analysis, and surrogate ethnography. In
      Being There,John Borneman and Abdellah Hammoudi argue that ethnographies based on these strategies elide important insights. To demonstrate the power and knowledge attained through the fieldwork experience, they have gathered essays by anthropologists working in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tanzania, the Canadian Arctic, India, Germany, and Russia that shift attention back to the subtle dynamics of the ethnographic encounter. From an Inuit village to the foothills of Kilimanjaro, each account illustrates how, despite its challenges, fieldwork yields important insights outside the reach of textual analysis.<br>

  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

  Abstract: The late historian Albert Hourani once remarked that the Arabs are looking at themselves with eyes given to them by Europe. In a way, this is a study of these “eyes” and the things they saw, failed to see, or chose to ignore. By talking about eyes, Hourani aimed at something more substantial than a mere perspective or view. These eyes were nothing but new categories of knowledge, such as geography, anthropology, sociology, and, the subject of this book, the modern European tradition of making sense of the past.

  Abstract: The change in Maori practice is probably the most controversial part of my argument. I present my thesis hesitantly because no one seems to have a clear knowledge of precontact or “traditional” Maori anthropophagy. In fact this phrasing might be a misnomer because New Zealand consisted of a multiplicity of Maori communities, such that, forms of anthropophagy, wherever they existed, would have shown local variations. Conventional ethnography simply constructs an ideal type of Maori cannibalism from a variety of statements—interviews with older men, myths, missionary and magistrate accounts, and even that of eyewitnesses.

  Abstract: Though the history of Neoplatonism starts, properly speaking, with Plotinus (205–70),¹ what we have called the Neoplatonic reading of Homer had its sources in habits of thought developed long before the third century and found full expression not in Plotinus himself but in Porphyry and then in the later Neoplatonists. Plotinus never mentions the name of Homer² and is very little concerned with interpretation of texts and myths from the poets. In the relatively sparse echoes of Homer and other poetry in the

  Author(s) Bultmann R.<br>
  Abstract: We noted in the previous chapter Bultmann’s claim that radical demythologizing is “the consistent application [of the doctrine of justification by faith alone] to the field of knowledge.”² This application has both a negative and a positive dimension. Negatively it is criticism of objectifying thinking within the

Demythologizing is a critical epistemology in the sense that it subverts every attempt to interpret the kerygma in the form of aWeltanschauung. It is thus an antimythological and antimetaphysical—i.e., deconstantinizing—hermeneutic.<br>

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

As was true in other patronage systems, success depended on their ability to exercise force and distribute wealth. However, they also relied on other political resources. Knowledge mongers as well as pursuers of military power and material riches, the heroes in Judges valued information as much as physical strength, adeptness with patronage, or the ability to administer a great house.

Accordingly, philosophical knowledge comes from inquiring into the natures of things rather than from learning to speak. Despite discovering the conventionality of language, Plato still accords speech a crucial role. Insight into the nature of things occurs by means of a conversation carried out with conventional terms: “For this knowledge is not something that can be put into words like other sciences;<br>

  Abstract: This is a book about how scholars make sense of what we study.¹ As a field of research whose primary focus is a fixed and finite set of data, biblical studies innovates less by discovering new objects of study than by finding fresh ways—or refining old ways—to examine its basic subject matter. Scholars investigate by designing categories of analysis and interpretation to achieve understanding. Regular assessment of the value of these categories—however recondite it may appear to a field’s outsiders—provokes scholarly self-consciousness and thereby strengthens the quality of research and advances knowledge.<br>

Representation of trauma and construction of collective identity are facilitated by these flexible, preexisting schemas.

  Abstract: Robert Frost observed that poetry begins in delight and ends in wisdom. When asked in an interview whether the same could be said of a poet’s career, Seamus Heaney responded by saying that a poet “begins in delight and ends in self-consciousness.”¹ In their claims about poetic practice, both Frost and Heaney embrace the commonplace notion that poets first begin to find a voice by delighting in language. Beyond this, their statements also suggest that such playful indulgence leads, or should lead, not only to a greater command of language but to a more pervasive and subtle knowledge of the<br>

  Book Title: Bruno Latour in Pieces: An Intellectual Biography-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Custance Gloria<br>
  Abstract: Bruno Latour stirs things up. Latour began as a lover of science and technology, co-founder of actor-network theory, and philosopher of a modernity that had "never been modern." In the meantime he is regarded not just as one of the most intelligent and also popular exponents of science studies but also as a major innovator of the social sciences, an exemplary wanderer who walks the line between the sciences and the humanities. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of the Latourian oeuvre, from his early anthropological studies in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), to influential books like Laboratory Life and Science in Action, and his most recent reflections on an empirical metaphysics of "modes of existence." In the course of this enquiry it becomes clear that the basic problem to which Latour's work responds is that of social tradition, the transmission of experience and knowledge. What this empirical philosopher constantly grapples with is the complex relationship of knowledge, time, and culture.<br>

  Abstract: One of the most heavily discussed topics in theological anthropology focuses on different interpretations of the meaning of imago Dei, humanity made in the image of God. A deeper knowledge of the common evolutionary heritage of human beings and other creatures has prompted some discussion about whether such a position of seemingly absolute human distinctiveness can still be maintained. Furthermore, mounting ecological awareness, and sensitivity to the shameless exploitation of other animals, points to the potential ethical ambiguity in maintaining a strong sense of human superiority.

Its laws apply universally, and even though its results are more reliable than those that come from other sources of knowledge, it is always open to revision.

  Abstract: The most pressing issues of the twenty-first century-climate change and persistent hunger in a world of food surpluses, to name only two-are not problems that can be solved from within individual disciplines, nation-states, or cultural perspectives. They are predicaments that can only be resolved by generating sustained and globally robust coordination across value systems. The scale of the problems and necessity for coordinated global solutions signal a world historical transit as momentous as the Industrial Revolution: a transition from the predominance of technical knowledge to that of ethical deliberation. This volume brings together leading thinkers from around the world to deliberate on how best to correlate worth (value) with what is worthwhile (values), pairing human prosperity with personal, environmental, and spiritual flourishing in a world of differing visions of what constitutes a moral life.<br>

Everything is demanded of theology, up to and including the most austere renunciation, the most shocking deprivation of its privileges, of its regal aspirations as the queen of the sciences, of its own special knowledge, revelations, and inspirations, requiring it to be poor and itinerant, naked and obedient, even unto death.

  Abstract: When William James sniffed nitrous oxide in the spring of 1882, he resurrected and transformed an experimental gesture which had been central to the practice of Christian mysticism. For centuries, Western ecstatics had attempted to transcend the boundaries of the human personality, and thus approach a knowledge of the divine life through the employment of ascetic and meditative techniques. The writings of Père Surin, Madame Guyon and Catherine of Genoa give minute and often horrifying descriptions of these methods: Surin crippled himself jumping from a window into the River Garonne; Catherine starved herself; while Mme Guyon (perhaps the most extreme<br>

  Abstract: Through the engagement with the work of Heinrich von Kleist and Clarice Lispector, in the analysis of Cixous’ ‘Grace and Innocence’ in the previous chapter, we can see how she can be understood to be reorienting the epistemological concerns of the Biblical story of the Fall through which the text is framed. In so doing, she reframes the way we might think about the notions of both grace and innocence particularly as they bear on the issue of the relationship between subjectivity and knowledge. The Fall, as such, is no longer simply meaningful in the brute dichotomy of knowledge versus<br>

As with Adorno and Foucault, he can be claimed, also, for a further intellectual lineage – that of ethical reflection as opposed to just negatively critical, denunciatory sociology. This does not just mean that Bourdieu was right-minded and ‘ethical’ in the sense of being moral (whatever one might mean by this). It means that his work is addressed as much to issues of the self, and especially to our reflexivity and autonomy, as to just epistemic issues of positive ‘knowledge’ and denunciatory critique.

  Abstract: John 8:12–20 depicts Jesus engaged in a debate with the Pharisees over the validity of his self-testimony. After Jesus claims to be the “light of the world” (8:12), the Pharisees reply that Jesus testifies to himself, which automatically invalidates the content of his testimony (8:13). Jesus counters their concern with a concession: “even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I came from and where I go; but you do not know where I come from or where I go” (8:14).

But such acknowledgment presupposes a separation from that which one responds to, or more generally, it presupposes finitude.

  Abstract: Throughout this book I have underlined an issue that accompanies the various discourses of liberation and decolonial thought in Latin America, namely, the issue of its aesthetic dimension. As we saw, Dussel’s philosophy of liberation is based on a pre-rational and pre-linguistic sensibility, a sense of radical exteriority, that distinguishes humans. Quijano exposes a pre-rational disposition or sensibility that sustains the coloniality of power and knowledge. Moreover, as he goes on to uncover and engage ana-chronic simultaneity in Latin American existence, Quijano turns to the writers, poets, and artists of Latin America, who articulate senses of existence beyond and otherwise<br>

  Book Title: The Incarnate Lord-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>

  Abstract: The Incarnate Lord, then, considers central themes in Christology from a metaphysical perspective. Particular attention is given to the hypostatic union, the two natures of Christ, the knowledge and obedience of Jesus, the passion and death of Christ, his descent into hell, and resurrection. A central concern of the book is to argue for the perennial importance of ontological principles of Christology inherited from patristic and scholastic authors. However, the book also seeks to advance an interpretation of Thomistic Christology in a modern context. The teaching Aquinas, then, is central to the study, but it is placed in conversation with various modern theologians, such as Karl Barth, Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar. Ultimately the goal of the work is to suggest how traditional Catholic theology might thrive under modern conditions, and also develop fruitfully from engaging in contemporary controversies.<br>

  Book Title: Speak Thus-Christian Language in Church and World<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Hovey Craig R.<br>
  Abstract: In its various forms, speech is absolutely integral to the Christian mission. The gospel is a message, news that must be passed on if it is to be known by others. Nevertheless, the reality of God cannot be exhausted by Christian knowledge and Christian knowledge cannot be exhausted by our words. All the while, the philosophy of modernity has left Christianity an impoverished inheritance within which to think these things. In Speak Thus, Craig Hovey explores the possibilities and limits of Christian speaking. At times ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical, these essays go to the heart of what it means to be the church today. In practice, the Christian life often has a linguistic shape that surprisingly implicates and reveals the commitments of people like those who care for the sick or those who respond as peacemakers in the face of violence. Because learning to speak one way as opposed to another is a skill that must be learned, Christian speakers are also guides who bear witness to the importance of churches for passing on a felicity with Christian ways of speaking. Through constructive engagements with interlocutors like Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Lindbeck, Jeffrey Stout, Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, Thomas Aquinas, and the theology of Radical Orthodoxy, Hovey offers a challenging vision of the church'able to speak with a confidence that only comes from a deep attentiveness to its own limitations while able to speak prophetically in a world weary of words.<br>

If we put our faith in the well known, if we place confidence in common sense, to what extent do we risk credulity? Hoaxes, as Judith Roof tells us, operate through the archive of the hoax – through our unforgotten knowledge that what seems too good to be true cannot be true. Even the very commonness of such wisdom – the commonness of common sense – can, as the success<br>

  Abstract: This chapter explores the development of a Maya cooperative movement in Guatemala from the 1940s through the 1960s. The cooperative movement had powerful economic effects in the country. It enabled Mayas to enter the global market, to bypass ladino intermediaries, and to access new land. These changes contributed to an economic transformation with powerful political implications. Maya cooperative leaders gained knowledge and training that facilitated broader organizing. In 1975 New York Times journalist Alan Riding described the “Indian cooperative movement” as the “first authentic rural movement in Guatemala’s history, so far involving about 20 percent of the 3.5 million Indian<br>

  Abstract: The historical process of accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things, as we have seen, is internally conditioned by human capacities, but many forms of normative systems condition it as well. On the one hand, accomplishing oneself and accomplishing things concretely unfolds as a process of knowing and practicing, which involves different senses of normativity. On the other hand, the knowledge and wisdom formed through this process further constrain knowing and practicing by means of externalizing, transforming into universal systems of norms.

In him one finds the most highly refined expression of the philosophical belief that thinking is not possible save through the articulation of strongly hierarchical systems, as well as a subsequent disregard for the ontological dignity of contingency<br>

  Abstract: The relationship between anthropology and history is one of inequality. This is no less so for the relationship between anthropology and microhistory. History, one of the noble disciplines in the “history” of Western thought, has as an emblem the muse, Clio. Anthropology has anyone who at times is everyone, at times someone, so often nameless and unvoiced. In their relationship, anthropology is the junior partner, a Johnny-come-lately to the professional telling of pastness within intellectual worlds whose denizens believe in the existence and importance of the time-depths of history, probably since these also are perceived as the sources of knowledge.<br>

This notion itself is based on a concept of objectivity which introduces a categorical separation between reality and its description or analysis, and thus gets into the problem of the adequacy of representation and its correspondence to the object depicted.

  Author(s): Webber Jonathan<br>
  Abstract: Contrary to the negative assessments of the social order that have become prevalent in the media since 9/11, this wide-ranging collection of essays, mostly by social anthropologists, focuses instead on the enormous social creativity being invested as collective identities are reconfigured. Using fieldwork findings drawn from Africa, Asia, and Europe, special emphasis is placed on the reformulation of ethnic and gender relationships and identities in the cultural, social, political, and religious realms of public life. Under what circumstances does trust arise, paving the way for friendship, collegiality, knowledge creation, national unity, or emergence of leadership? How is social life constructed as a collective endeavour? Does the means towards sociability become its end? And what can be said about the agency and collegiality of women? The inspiration for examining these conundrums is the work and persona of Shirley Ardener, to whom the volume is dedicated.<br>

When in modernity science came into a dominant position, religion was categorized in accordance with its nonscientific nature, given that the transcendental reality to which it refers is not open to empirical verification.

One of the most dangerous consequences of the convergence of global reach and deep time, of course, was to conflate the two, equating others with ancients.

  Book Title: Wallace Stevens among Others-Diva-Dames, Deleuze, and American Culture<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): JARRAWAY DAVID R.<br>
  Abstract: In Wallace Stevens among Others David Jarraway explores the extraordinary achievement of Wallace Stevens, but in contexts that are not usually thought about in connection with Stevens's work - gay literature, contemporary fiction, Hollywood film, and avant-garde architecture, among others. By viewing the poet among these "other" contexts, Jarraway considers the nature of self-reflection and pays special attention to the discrediting of self-presence as the principle of identity in American writing - a theme that reflects American authors’ abiding concern for subjectivities that engage the world from spaces of distance and difference. By returning to the work of Stevens, Jarraway seeks to refurbish this preoccupation by linking it to the literary theory of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, whose work applies to American writers from Melville and Whitman to Fitzgerald and Cummings. Jarraway forges the link between Deleuze and Stevens by drawing out the female subjectivity found in each writer’s work to rethink the more static masculinist premises of being. Informed by a deep knowledge of and fluency with the work of Stevens and Deleuze, Jarraway uses these writers as a means of entry into American literature and culture, Wallace Stevens among Others is a sophisticated analysis that will open new directions for future scholarship.<br>

  Book Title: In the Fellowship of His Suffering-A Theological Interpretation of Mental Illness — A Focus on "Schizophrenia"<br>
  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Swinton John<br>
  Abstract: Schizophrenia is often considered one of the most destructive forms of mental illness. Elahe Hessamfar’s personal experience with her daughter’s illness has led her to ask some pressing and significant questions about the cause and nature of schizophrenia and the Church’s role in its treatment. With a candid and revealing look at the history of mental illness, In the Fellowship of His Suffering describes schizophrenia as a variation of human expression. Hessamfar uses a deeply theological rather than pathological approach to interpret the schizophrenic experience and the effect it has on both the patients and their families. Effectively drawing on the Bible as a source of knowledge for understanding mental illness, she offers a reflective yet innovative view of whether the Church could or should intervene in such encounters and what such an intervention might look like. Hessamfar’s comprehensive work will provoke powerful responses from anyone interested in the prominent social issue of mental illness. Her portrayal of the raging debate between treating “insanity" either pastorally or medically will enthral readers, be they Christians, medical students or those in the field of psychiatry and social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: As we tried to imply in the last two chapters, the disclosure of literary genre is intended to be a momentous event in the introduction of a text, tantamount perhaps to the discovery of an edible species of plant by a starving explorer. Despite the promise of such an occasion, however, in actual practice it can sometimes be frustrating, offering less of a hermeneutical advantage than is sometimes anticipated. But take courage! It is a bit like the great dialogue of Plato,
                  Theaetetus, where knowledge and understanding are discussed and debated. One begins by thinking s/he knows what knowledge is,<br>

  Book Title: The Atheist's Primer-  Publisher: The Lutterworth Press<br>
  Author(s): Palmer Michael<br>
  Abstract: In The Atheist's Primer, a prominent philosopher, Dr Michael Palmer, reinstates the importance of philosophy in the debate about God's existence. The 'new atheism' of Richard Dawkins and others has been driven by largely Darwinian objections to God's existence, limiting the debate to within a principally scientific framework. This has obscured the philosophical tradition of atheism, in which the main intellectual landmarks in atheism's history are to be found. With an analysis of atheistic thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day, Palmer explains and comments on the philosophical arguments warranting atheism, discussing issues such as evil, morality, miracles, and the motivations for belief. The emphasis placed on materialism and the limitations of our knowledge might seem disheartening to some; but Palmer concludes on a positive note, arguing – alongside Nietzsche, Marx and Freud and many others – that happiness and personal fulfilment are to be found in the very materialism that religious belief rejects. Michael Palmer first addressed these issues in his student-oriented edition, The Atheist's Creed, of which The Atheist's Primer is a revised abridgement for the general reader. Palmer has now stripped out the primary texts and expanded his commentaries into fluent and concise analyses of the arguments. Free of philosophical jargon and assumptions of prior knowledge, this is an important introduction to a major cultural debate.<br>

  Author(s) Berthrong John<br>
  Abstract: Dilthey in his later years came to appreciate Husserl’s (1859–1938) teachings, which avoid psychological reasoning and articulate the importance of the idea of evidence and a methodological procedure in cognitive analyses. Husserl’s
                  Logical Investigations, published in two volumes in 1900 /1901, created phenomenology, including a new insight into hermeneutical theory. Husserl takes issue with Dilthey’s notion of worldview associated with historicism, because he believes that Dilthey depends on knowledge of historical relativity, causing the absolute validity of any particular life-interpretation, religion, or philosophy to disappear. The formation of a historical consciousness destroys “the belief in the universal validity” undertaken<br>

  Book Title: Translating the English Bible-From Relevance to Deconstruction<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Goodwin Philip W.<br>
  Abstract: In his detailed and thought-provoking work, Philip Goodwin conducts a thorough analysis of the challenges facing the Biblical translator, with particular focus on the problematic dominance of the King James Version of the Bible in our imaginations – a dominance which has had a deleterious effect upon the accuracy and originality of the translator's work. Goodwin considers the first two chapters of the Lukan narratives in depth, comparing and contrasting a breadth of widely disparate translations and drawing on a rich body of Biblical scholarship to support his thesis. A wide-ranging discussion of other linguistic issues is also conducted, touching on such vital matters as incorporating the contextual implications of the original text, and the attempt to challenge the reader's pre-existing encyclopaedic knowledge. Goodwin evolves a fresh and comprehensive answer to the difficulties of the translator's task, and concludes by providing his own original and charming translation of the first two chapters of Luke's Gospel. 'Translating the English Bible' provides a fascinating insight into the processes of translation and will interest anyone seeking accuracy and fidelity to the Scriptural message. It will also enlighten readers seeking a challenging translation of Luke that casts off the shackles of the 'Holy Marriage' tradition of Biblical translation.<br>

  Author(s): Ille George<br>
  Abstract: The present study seeks to respond theologically to current discussions about ideas of self from the perspective of God’s action in and towards the world. Its aim is to trace a view of rationality that follows the drama of God’s engagement with the world, thus involving dying and resurrection, ascesis and abundance, suffering witness and Eucharistic communion. Since, as Calvin notes, knowledge of God and knowledge of self are intimately bound together, this exercise of discerning the shape of a theological rationality in the present arena of competing promises of meaning and truth is carried out on two levels: the theological and the anthropological.<br>

  Book Title: Biblical Knowing-A Scriptural Epistemology of Error<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Bartholomew Craig G.<br>
  Abstract: The Christian Scriptures could be theologically described as beginning and ending with an epistemological outlook. The first episode of humanity’s activity centers on the knowledge of good and evil. The final stage of humanity is pictured by Jeremiah as a universally prophetic and knowing society: 'And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord', for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the Lord' (Jer 31:34). What happens to knowledge in between? In this work, Dru Johnson reconsiders epistemology with the tool of biblical theology: an approach to knowledge as developed in Genesis 2 and explored throughout the Tanakh (i.e., the Old Testament) and New Testament. By re-examining the neglected idea that Christian Scripture might be developing robust descriptions of knowing that can direct us today, the ambition of this book is to lay the groundwork for a biblical theology of knowledge - how knowledge is broached, described, and how error is rectified within the texts of the Christian canon. Proper knowing as it occurs in the Scriptures means that there are better and worse ways to know. Even more, the epistemology that is found to be advocated in Scripture is not relegated to religious knowing. Johnson argues that scientific epistemology and biblical epistemology make significant points of contact suggesting that they are fundamentally consistent with each other.<br>

What does the Tanakh then do with this view of knowing throughout its texts? Stated otherwise, is the epistemological process of Genesis 2–3 unique or normative? We contend below that Scripture recounts Israel’s errors in terms of Genesis 2–3, where knowing is contingent upon which authority is being heeded, and then whether or not the knower participates in the prescribed route to knowledge (e.g., not eating the fruit of prohibition).

  Abstract: Leafing through introductory textbooks in Christian systematic theology, you will find discussions of salvation located in multiple places—under the topics of Christology (the nature and work of Christ), the “other” religions, and eschatology, the study of last or final things. Insofar as these primers orient elementary readers into knowledge of Christian faith, they set out the major points for theological discussion and debate. Eschatology often becomes the major landing point for discussions of salvation because the question of salvation is often framed in terms of ultimate ends. Under the doctrine of eschatology, soteriological discussions will circle around Jesus’s saying,<br>

The first, notable in Thomas, sees non-Christian religions as useful preparations for the Gospel (

  Abstract: While some theorists have suggested that translation is impossible (Payne 1971), to a large degree Western civilization and culture has depended upon translated documents originally written in one language into some other, usually more common, language. A large portion of our current understanding of philosophy, history, mythology, and religion comes to us through translated documents. What could we know of Aristotle, Plato, Moses, or Muhammad without contemporary translations of their writings into our mother tongue? From the philosophy of Immanuel Kant to the literature of Victor Hugo, the breadth of human knowledge is inextricably linked to the translation of documents<br>

Other topics include archival research into the study of Vancouver Island's indigenous languages, explorations of the Christian notion of virgin births in Edward Tylor'sThe Legend of Perseus, and the Canadian government's implementation of European-model farms as a way to undermine Native culture. In addition to Boas and Tylor, the essays explore the research and personalities of Susan Golla, Edwin Sydney Hartland, and others.<br>

  Abstract: In many ways, the possibilities for contemporary philosophical and theological thinking have been determined by Kant. Whether explicitly or implicitly, religion has been thought consistently either within, along, or beyond the limits legislated by classical modern reason. At the same time, its status has remained problematic, because it was left out of the fundamental sources of human knowledge according to Kant’s critique. Although he essentially appended religion onto morality, since that time, religion has flirted with and been skirted by scientific theoretical knowledge, ethics, and aesthetics. In his

With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture.

  Abstract: Bourdieu’s work was deeply moulded by the national intellectual milieu in which it developed, that of France in the late 1940s and 1950s, a milieu characterised by disputes between phenomenologists and structuralists. But it is not this national and cultural dimension that distinguishes Bourdieu’s writings from those of other ‘grand theorists’. Habermas and Giddens, for example, owed as much to the academic or political context of their home countries. What set Bourdieu’s approach apart from that of his German and British ‘rivals’ was a significantly stronger linkage of theoretical and empirical knowledge.

The political is concerned with the control of and access to resources, knowledge, and power. The power attributed to the Bible is profoundly demonstrated in the 2010 American postapocalyptic film

  Author(s) McHALE BRIAN<br>
  Abstract: CHARACTER NARRATION is a fertile spawning ground for unnatural or antimimetic narration, especially for sporadic outbreaks of the antimimetic within narration whose dominant code is mimetic—that is, one that respects the normal human limitations of knowledge, temporal and spatial mobility, and so on.¹ Character narration generates these breaks from the mimetic code because, as an art of indirection, it places significant constraints on the (implied) author’s² freedom to communicate with her audience—and sometimes the author feels the need to operate outside those constraints. In employing either mimetic or antimimetic character narration, an author must use one text to<br>

The past is not simply ‘dead’. Significant elements survive into the present. The past may thus provide instructive parallels between one period of time and another, even if no events are literally rerun. And we learn too from happenings that are rare and strange as well as from those that are habitual and routine. All this renders knowledge of both past and present into an invaluable resource.

Yet the nature of this knowledge has varied from one period to another. Ancient writers, both classical and biblical, assumed that the essential patterns of life remained identical and therefore that history provided lasting models for instruction and imitation. Hence the search for historical prototypes of current customs and institutions.

  Abstract: Since David Hume (1711–1776), philosophy, as well as common sense, has differentiated science from morality. Science establishes facts (“what is”), whereas morality decides “what should be,” but many admit that we cannot distinguish what should be from what is. I shall consider whether it is plausible to take an opposite, although perhaps rather surprising, approach and ask whether we can favor what should be from our knowledge about what is. In fact, such a question belongs to a long philosophical tradition, including Hume, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825), Auguste Comte, Charles Darwin, and contemporary ethologists. My idea is to<br>

  Book Title: Agitations-Essays on Life and Literature<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Krystal Arthur<br>
  Abstract: We disagree. From small questions of taste to large questions concerning the nature of existence, intellectual debate takes up much of our time. In this book the respected literary critic Arthur Krystal examines what most commentators ignore: the role of temperament and taste in the forming of aesthetic and ideological opinions. In provocative essays about reading and writing, about the relation between life and literature, about knowledge and certainty, about God and death, and about his own gradual disaffection with the literary scene, Krystal demonstrates that opposing points of view are based more on innate predilections than on disinterested thought or analysis.Not beholden to any fashionable theory or political agenda, Krystal interrogates the usual suspects in the cultural wars from an independent, though not impartial, vantage point. Clearly personal and unabashedly belletrist, his essays ask important questions. What makes culture one thing and not another? What inspires aesthetic values? What drives us to make comparisons? And how does a bias for one kind of evidence as opposed to another contribute to the form and content of intellectual argument?<br>

This tension betweentheoryandpracticewas also evident when the new interest in practical wisdom (phronesis), which occurred in the carnival-like scientific atmosphere of the sixteenth century, with its focus on concrete, practical life and time-bound local practices, was supplanted around 1630 by an abstract and universalistic scientific paradigm, which instead took as its point of departure theoretical understanding (episteme).<br>

The limited social mobility, settled way of life, and minimal knowledge of the “other” in geographical and cultural terms in early societies meant that physical expulsion from the homeland was one of the most severe forms of punishment, almost equivalent to death.¹ Exile is connected to a range of other important signifiers: separation, loss, alienation, loneliness, and nostalgia.

Nuestro trabajo aborda el modo en que el conocimiento científico modula la creación literaria, así como algunos de los procedimientos del pensamiento literario. Las hipótesis de investigación reposan sobre dos niveles de la escritura de Lorand Gaspar: la dimensión epistemológica del discurso poético y su valor cognitivo. A partir del análisis de un corpus literario se propone una metodología de estudio que atiende a la complejidad epistemológica y cognitiva de la enunciación poética. Tres apartados teóricos organizan la investigación de algunos de los procesos del pensamiento poético: percepción, emoción y metáfora. Lo anterior se enmarca en una argumentación que favorece la transdisciplinariedad mediante estrategias de análisis literario que integran consideraciones de carácter interdisciplinar.This thesis studies the relations between Science and Poetry. The research approaches the way in which the scientific knowledge modulates the literary creation, as well as some of the procedures of the literary thought.

Based on the analysis of a literary corpus this research proposes a methodology of study that attends to the epistemological and cognitive complexity of the lyrical enunciation.

  Abstract: The debate on the historization of National Socialism has raised substantial theoretical problems that need further elucidation. The thrust of the
                  Historikerstreitwas largely political, which meant that fundamental questions on the nature of historical knowledge inherent in that dispute went unseen; they were generally not touched upon or figured only on the periphery. But the exchange of letters between Martin Broszat and Saul Friedländer prompted by the formers provocative “plea” was different.⁴ It also addressed political constellations in German historical culture, and National Socialism’s place in German memory. Yet it differed from the historians’ debate in several ways: the<br>

  Abstract: From the

  Book Title: Piaget's Theory of Knowledge-Genetic Epistemology and Scientific Reason<br>
  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): KITCHENER RICHARD F.<br>
  Abstract: Best known as a child psychologist, Jean Piaget considered himself primarily an epistemologist who was engaged in empirical research on the development of knowledge. In this book, philosopher and psychologist Richard F. Kitchener provides the first comprehensive study in English of Piaget's genetic epistemology, or his theory of knowledge. Drawing largely on a careful perusal of Piaget's untranslated works, Kitchener presents little-known aspects of Piaget's thought and argues that, in fact, Piagest has been misunderstood and was completely justified in his claim to be an epistemologist rather than a psychologist.<br>

  Abstract: Genetic epistemology, as I have argued, is not some kind of cleverly disguised genetic psychology. It is precisely what its name indicates-an epistemology oriented towards the genesis and development of knowledge. But as we have seen, it has a complex domain, including the growth of knowledge both in the individual person and in the history of science. As such, it is not merely an epistemology but also a philosophy of science. For, after all, if the philosophy of science is taken to be the epistemology of science-an assumption widely accepted-and if genetic epistemology is concerned with the epistemology of scientific<br>

  Variations across Multiple Groups in Forms of Dreaming from:

  Abstract: Any cognitive psychology of dreaming must encounter and reconcile two statements: “the dream is a story” and “the dream is imagery.” Neither statement is as obvious as it initially appears, I I because there is no agreement in contemporary cognitive psychology on the ultimate relation between visual-spatial imagery and language. Much evidence and theory supports both the view that a visual-spatial imagistic intelligence rests directly on and creatively reorganizes the processes of perception and the view that mental imagery is a surface paraphrase of abstract propositional knowledge, whose deep structure is accordingly far closer to verbal syntax than visual imagery.<br>

  Book Title: Points of Departure-Rethinking Student Source Use and Writing Studies Research Methods<br>
  Publisher: Utah State University Press<br>
  Author(s): JAMIESON SANDRA<br>
  Abstract: Points of Departureencourages a return to empirical research about writing, presenting a wealth of transparent, reproducible studies of student sources. The volume shows how to develop methods for coding and characterizing student texts, their choice of source material, and the resources used to teach information literacy. In so doing, the volume advances our understanding of how students actually write.The contributors offer methodologies, techniques, and suggestions for research that move beyond decontextualized guides to grapple with the messiness of research-in-process, as well as design, development, and expansion. Serviss and Jamieson's model of RAD writing studies research is transcontextual and based on hybridized or mixed methods. Among these methods are citation context analysis, research-aloud protocols, textual and genre analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups, with an emphasis on process and knowledge as contingent. Chapters report on research projects at different stages and across institution types-from pilot to multi-site, from community college to research university-focusing on the methods and artifacts employed.A rich mosaic of research about research,Points of Departureadvances knowledge about student writing and serves as a guide for both new and experienced researchers in writing studies.Contributors: Crystal Benedicks, Katt Blackwell-Starnes, Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch, Kristi Murray Costello, Anne Diekema, Rebecca Moore Howard, Sandra Jamieson, Elizabeth Kleinfeld, Brian N.

  Abstract: Seeking to understand why some students succeed in specific disciplines while others do not, Erik Meyer and Ray Land posited that there are key—or threshold—concepts in every field that must be understood and incorporated into one’s thinking before one can move forward in that field (Meyer and Land 2003). Once these conceptual “thresholds” have been crossed, learners can build on the knowledge made accessible by them and progress to the next threshold, gaining ever-deeper understanding and mastery as they go.

  Book Title: Fundamental Theology-  Publisher: Catholic University of America Press<br>
  Author(s): Mansini Guy<br>
  Abstract: Fundamental Theologyexamines the light by which the mysteries of Christ and the Church, the Trinity and the Sacraments, are revealed to us. That light we call "revelation," and fundamental theology examines in the first place what this light shows about itself, and how it is sustained in the world. Or again, fundamental theology considers what the word of God has to say both about itself and what it has to say about where in the world it is to be heard. So, first it is a theology of Revelation (chapter 1), and second, a theology of the transmission of Revelation in Tradition, Scripture, and the Church (chapters 2, 3, and 4). Why must Revelation have the shape it does, and why must it be constituted by both word and event? Why is Tradition prior to Scripture, why must the word of God be written down, and why must Scripture come to us in two testaments? And why must the message conveyed in Tradition and Scripture have a living interpreter in the Church?Since no word is spoken unless it is heard, fundamental theology also investigates the conditions of hearing the word of God, the very hearing itself in the assent of faith, and a necessary consequence of this hearing. The remote conditions of hearing are also what theology calls our ability to come to the knowledge of thepreambula fidei- the things about God than can be known by the natural light (chapter 5). The immediate condition of hearing is the credibility of the word (chapter 6). Hearing is faith (chapter 7). And true hearing gives the hearer to recapitulate what is heard in his own wondering and thankful voice in theology (chapter 8). The introduction to theology in the last chapter is by way of considering the history of Catholic theology in the 20th century.<br>

That is, the knowledge of God in faith is a higher knowledge than any other, both as to its content and as to its way of knowing. As to its content: it tells us of the intimate things of God, his triune life which otherwise we could not know, and of his will to invite us to share this life, and of the way to this goal.

  Abstract: So far, the argument against the autonomy project or, more specifically, the religion-within-the-limits-of-reason-alone project has proceeded in two stages, unequal in length. First, a crucial premise of the enterprise has shown itself to be unsustainable. It is the assumption that human reason is universal, part of the standard equipment of human nature. As such, it is presumed to be objective, neutral, presuppositionless, the only source of reliable knowledge. As such, it is “nonsectarian” by contrast with the plurality of “religions of the book,” those that appeal to the authority of some particular divine revelation and are in this way heteronomous.<br>

  Abstract: What happens when math nerds, band and theater geeks, goths, sci-fi fanatics, Young Republican debate poindexters, techies, Trekkies, D&D players, wallflowers, bookworms, and RPG players grow up? And what can they tell us about the life of the mind in the contemporary United States? With #GamerGate in the national news, shows like The Big Bang Theory on ever-increasing numbers of screens, and Peter Orzsag and Paul Ryan on magazine covers, it is clear that nerds, policy wonks, and neoconservatives play a major role in today's popular culture in America. The Year's Work in Nerds, Wonks, and Neocons delves into subcultures of intellectual history to explore their influence on contemporary American intellectual life. Not limiting themselves to describing how individuals are depicted, the authors consider the intellectual endeavors these depictions have come to represent, exploring many models and practices of learnedness, reflection, knowledge production, and opinion in the contemporary world. As teachers, researchers, and university scholars continue to struggle for mainstream visibility, this book illuminates the other forms of intellectual excitement that have emerged alongside them and found ways to survive and even thrive in the face of dismissal or contempt.<br>

  Author(s): Coe Cynthia D.<br>
  Abstract: Levinas's account of responsibility challenges dominant notions of time, autonomy, and subjectivity according to Cynthia D. Coe. Employing the concept of trauma in Levinas's late writings, Coe draws together his understanding of time and his claim that responsibility is an obligation to the other that cannot be anticipated or warded off. Tracing the broad significance of these ideas, Coe shows how Levinas revises our notions of moral agency, knowledge, and embodiment. Her focus on time brings a new interpretive lens to Levinas's work and reflects on a wider discussion of the fragmentation of human experience as an ethical subject. Coe's understanding of trauma and time offers a new appreciation of how Levinas can inform debates about gender, race, mortality, and animality.<br>

In The Humanities in the Age of Technology, Ciriaco Morón Arroyo offers a systematic inquiry into these questions and outlines the ongoing crisis of the humanities.<br>

  Abstract: Heidegger’s statement about philosophy can be extrapolated to the humanities in general. In order to show how humanistic discourse can be intellectually rigorous I have analyzed Calderón’s 
                  Life is a Dream and in a less direct and comprehensive way Don Quijote. In the preceding chapter I have pointed out several things we can do with the humanities, but what we do with them must be founded on their objective value, that is, on what they can do with us. And what they can do, when cultivated as “rigorous knowledge” (Husserl’s idea as alpha and omega) is enlighten us about the<br>

  Abstract: Is there a specifically Christian response to pain, suffering, and sorrow? For Aquinas, the infused virtues of patience and perseverance distinctly offer Christian criteria and models. They involve necessary dispositions for Christian maturity in the face of adversity. These infused virtues should not be confused with the acquired virtues of the same names or resistant resilience (chapter 6), even though they can strengthen already existing acquired virtues. Furthermore, the theological virtue of hope, the gift of knowledge, the fruit of patience, and the beatitude of mourners all constitute a Christian type of patience and perseverance.

  Abstract: It is not at all easy to free human awareness from the captivating idea that the human being can account for his own existence without coming to terms with the question of his own origin. The anthropological turn of modernity, for the sake of pursuing more pressing matters or more deceivingly fundamental issues, presumed that severing the question of God from the inquiry into the human being’s own identity would give wings to the quest for knowledge. Instead, as postmodernity witnesses, this too-often rated “successful” revolution has yielded a radical dissolution of any unifying principle and thus, of man himself.<br>

  Abstract: Centralised governance of effective knowledge sharing is very difficult in times of rapid change, especially for purposeful, information rich, socio-technical wicked systems. The lines of communication quickly become clogged, leaders suffer information overload and are unable to fully appreciate problems at the local level. Decentralisation of knowledge sharing runs the risk of causing local overload, with key information not being prioritised or depending on actors who only have experience at processing local problems. Alternatives such as ʹmiddle-outʹ (Keen, 1999) have been suggested, where strategically informed middle level actors play a coordination role between the top and bottom level actors. This<br>

  Book Title: The Philosophy of Neo-Noir-  Publisher: The University Press of Kentucky<br>
  Author(s): Conard Mark T.<br>
  Abstract: Film noir is a classic genre characterized by visual elements such as tilted camera angles, skewed scene compositions, and an interplay between darkness and light. Common motifs include crime and punishment, the upheaval of traditional moral values, and a pessimistic stance on the meaning of life and on the place of humankind in the universe. Spanning the 1940s and 1950s, the classic film noir era saw the release of many of Hollywood's best-loved studies of shady characters and shadowy underworlds, including Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, Touch of Evil, and The Maltese Falcon. Neo-noir is a somewhat loosely defined genre of films produced after the classic noir era that display the visual or thematic hallmarks of the noir sensibility. The essays collected in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir explore the philosophical implications of neo-noir touchstones such as Blade Runner, Chinatown, Reservoir Dogs, Memento, and the films of the Coen brothers. Through the lens of philosophy, Mark T. Conard and the contributors examine previously obscure layers of meaning in these challenging films. The contributors also consider these neo-noir films as a means of addressing philosophical questions about guilt, redemption, the essence of human nature, and problems of knowledge, memory and identity. In the neo-noir universe, the lines between right and wrong and good and evil are blurred, and the detective and the criminal frequently mirror each other's most debilitating personality traits. The neo-noir detective -- more antihero than hero -- is frequently a morally compromised and spiritually shaken individual whose pursuit of a criminal masks the search for lost or unattainable aspects of the self. Conard argues that the films discussed in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir convey ambiguity, disillusionment, and disorientation more effectively than even the most iconic films of the classic noir era. Able to self-consciously draw upon noir conventions and simultaneously subvert them, neo-noir d~<br>

What is not often noticed is that globalization also harbors terminological and semantic quandaries. We know at least since Copernicus and Galileo that our Earth is a “globe” and not a flattened landscape. Given this knowledge, what does it mean that our habitat is “globalized” in our time? Surely, its physical “global” shape is not modified. In aggravated form, similar semantic problems beset other terms often used as equivalents: like

  Book Title: The Uncertain Sciences-  Publisher: Yale University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mazlish Bruce<br>
  Abstract: In this wide-ranging book one of the most esteemed cultural historians of our time turns his attention to major questions about human experience and the attempts to understand it "scientifically." Bruce Mazlish considers the achievements, failings, and possibilities of the human sciences-a domain that he broadly defines to include the social sciences, literature, psychology, and hermeneutic studies. In a rich and original synthesis built upon the work of earlier philosophers and historians, Mazlish constructs a new view of the nature and meaning of the human sciences.Starting with the remote human past and moving through the Age of Discovery to the present day, the author discusses what sort of knowledge the human sciences claim to offer. He looks closely at the positivistic aspirations of the human sciences, which are modeled after the natural sciences, and at their interpretive tendencies. In an analysis of scientific method and scientific community, he explores the roles they can or should assume in the human sciences. Mazlish's approach is genuinely interdisciplinary, and he draws on an array of topics, from civil society to globalization to the interactions of humans and machines, to inform his thought-provoking discussion of historical consciousness.<br>

Philosophically, it is seen as an epistemology that grounds all knowledge in experience and declares some objects accessible to observation and others inaccessible; the former are objects about which knowledge can be obtained, and the latter are not. In the human sciences, positivism takes the form of a sociology that claims that scientific knowledge about society is possible.<br>

In their youth, many of these scholars had received a traditional Jewish education, and their knowledge of Semitic languages (Hebrew and Aramaic) and rabbinic literature not only made Arabic and Islam more approachable but also enabled them to notice similarities between Judaism and Islam that were not as apparent to Christian orientalists like de Sacy, Umbreit, Fleischer, and Nöldeke. Jewish orientalists tended to be more favorably inclined toward Islam than their Christian counterparts, which often gave their research a less<br>

  Abstract: Avicenna’s epistemology is based on his conception of

  Book Title: Clan Cleansing in Somalia-The Ruinous Legacy of 1991<br>
  Publisher: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc.<br>
  Author(s): Kapteijns Lidwien<br>
  Abstract: In 1991, certain political and military leaders in Somalia, wishing to gain exclusive control over the state, mobilized their followers to use terror-wounding, raping, and killing-to expel a vast number of Somalis from the capital city of Mogadishu and south-central and southern Somalia. Manipulating clan sentiment, they succeeded in turning ordinary civilians against neighbors, friends, and coworkers. Although this episode of organized communal violence is common knowledge among Somalis, its real nature has not been publicly acknowledged and has been ignored, concealed, or misrepresented in scholarly works and political memoirs-until now. Marshaling a vast amount of source material, including Somali poetry and survivor accounts,
      Clan Cleansing in Somaliaanalyzes this campaign of clan cleansing against the historical background of a violent and divisive military dictatorship, in the contemporary context of regime collapse, and in relationship to the rampant militia warfare that followed in its wake.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaalso reflects on the relationship between history, truth, and postconflict reconstruction in Somalia. Documenting the organization and intent behind the campaign of clan cleansing, Lidwien Kapteijns traces the emergence of the hate narratives and code words that came to serve as rationales and triggers for the violence. However, it was not clans that killed, she insists, but people who killed in the name of clan. Kapteijns argues that the mutual forgiveness for which politicians often so lightly call is not a feasible proposition as long as the violent acts for which Somalis should forgive each other remain suppressed and undiscussed.Clan Cleansing in Somaliaestablishes that public acknowledgment of the ruinous turn to communal violence is indispensable to social and moral repair, and can provide a gateway for the critical memory work required from Somalis on all sides of this multifaceted conflict.<br>

  Abstract: Describing the novel that would become

Metaphysical detection calls into question structures taken for granted after Edgar Allan Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue” (1841): the hermeneutic strategies of rendering meaningful those signs which are unintelligible to others, and of divining the mind of an opponent; the epistemological method of discovering truth by questioning sources of knowledge; and the adept detective’s triumph over<br>

  Abstract: It was Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten’s

Aesthetics was concerned with a special faculty of perception that Baumgarten titled “sensuous knowledge” (cognitio sensitiva). In contrast to clear and distinct conceptual knowledge, sensuous knowledge is acognitio confusa, a confused knowledge form. “It is not aimed at distinctions; it pursues an animated intertwinement of aspects even when it is a matter of a stationary object. It lingers at a process of appearing,” Martin Seel remarks.¹ These processes of aesthetic appearing involve compounds of sensation or what I will call figures of sensation.<br>

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

It also involves underlying principles and theories that form the basis of a particular field of knowledge. Heidegger conceived the primary task of metaphysics as the clarification ofbeingin his book on phenomenological metaphysics,Being and Time.

  Abstract: An acute sense of what Marjorie Perloff called “the poetics of indeterminacy” has marked criticism and scholarship for at least thirty years.¹ Synthetic narratives—historicist, dialectical, psychoanalytic—have seen their truth values turn imaginary, becoming what William Blake in
                  The Marriage of Heaven and Hellcalled “poetic tales”: arbitrary constructions, “fictions of lineage,” and order.² With the space of knowledge grown so radically volatile and complex, even “contested,” the teacher’s watchword became “teach the conflicts,” the scholar’s, “explore the contradictions.” So David Reynolds dives “beneath the American Renaissance” to expose the fault lines of F.

  Abstract: In his 1956 song “(How Little It Matters) How Little We Know,” Frank Sinatra aptly poses the. epistemological verity facing every scientific investigator: scientific knowledge eventually fails to explain certain phenomena. Despite voluminous increases in scientific research and publishing, most scientists couch descriptions of the state of their disciplines (which often frame requests for additional funding) in terms of how much there remains to be discovered. Of course, they never intimate (or could even conceive) that their own particular work matters little. However, the Sinatra tune outlines even more vividly the theme of this chapter, late-nineteenth-century unease about the limits<br>

  Abstract: The following three chapters will successively be devoted to knowledge and reality, morality and politics, and God and religion—three of the four main domains of culture we distinguished. The fourth domain, art, will appear at the end of each of these chapters. Each chapter is construed along the same lines: it first presents Nietzsche’s critique of the domain in question and then addresses Nietzsche’s own position, presuppositions, and aims. In other words, each chapter proceeds from a presentation of the negative part of his thinking to an attempt to discover its positive part.<br>

This enlarged field of facts did not, though, exercise any great influence over the way geographers conceived of the foundations of their discipline. Their aim remained much the same: to use the tools of inductive reasoning to reduce the variety of the earth’s natural features to certain universal principles. Movement was a prerequisite of geographical knowledge. But it formed no part of geography’s representation of the world.<br>

Naming these beings and establishing rituals for experiencing their presence arises from the application of human thought and authority. The supernatural cannot be named without provoking questions about the meaning of the name as well as who has the right to speak on behalf of it and to what purpose. Our earliest evidence of answers to these questions among the Vietnamese comes from texts that reveal how rulers and their followers endeavored to systematize and narrate approved knowledge of supernatural beings.

  Book Title: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains-Culture and Society in the Highlands of Bali<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Reuter Thomas A.<br>
  Abstract: Custodians of the Sacred Mountains is the first comprehensive ethnography of the Bali Aga, a large ethnic minority that occupies the island's central highlands. The Bali Aga are popularly viewed as the indigenous counterparts to other Balinese who trace their origin to invaders from the Javanese kingdom of Majapait, who have ruled Bali from the fourteenth century A.D. Although Bali remains one of the most intensely researched localities in the world, the Bali Aga have long been overshadowed by the more exotic courtly culture of the south. A closer analysis of the changing position of the Bali Aga within Balinese society provides a key to understanding the politics and social process of cultural representation in Bali and beyond. The process is marked by a blend of representational competition and cooperation among the Bali Aga themselves, among the Bali Aga and southern Balinese, and later among the island's aristocratic elites and foreign colonizers or scholars, and state authorities. The study of this process raises important issues about the establishment and maintenance of status and power structures at regional, national, and global levels. Custodians of the Sacred Mountains explores the marginalization of the Bali Aga in light of a critical theory of cultural representation and calls for a morally engaged approach to ethnographic research. It proposes an intersubjective and communicative model of human interaction as the foundation for understanding the relative significance of cooperation and competition in the cultural production of knowledge.<br>

They also made comparisons between Pythagoras’s symbols and the efficacious speech used in magical practices. But after the third century c.e., the idea that symbols have the power to

  Book Title: Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tauber Alfred I.<br>
  Abstract: Freud began university intending to study both medicine and philosophy. But he was ambivalent about philosophy, regarding it as metaphysical, too limited to the conscious mind, and ignorant of empirical knowledge. Yet his private correspondence and his writings on culture and history reveal that he never forsook his original philosophical ambitions. Indeed, while Freud remained firmly committed to positivist ideals, his thought was permeated with other aspects of German philosophy. Placed in dialogue with his intellectual contemporaries, Freud appears as a reluctant philosopher who failed to recognize his own metaphysical commitments, thereby crippling the defense of his theory and misrepresenting his true achievement. Recasting Freud as an inspired humanist and reconceiving psychoanalysis as a form of moral inquiry, Alfred Tauber argues that Freudianism still offers a rich approach to self-inquiry, one that reaffirms the enduring task of philosophy and many of the abiding ethical values of Western civilization.<br>

As already briefly mentioned, during his early university days Freud explicitly rejected philosophy, because of its “speculative” character. He struggled with balancing the intellectual appeal of philosophy with the “certainty” he hoped to find in positivist science. That move heralded the series of clinical studies that would eventually emerge in the therapeutic system of psychoanalysis, a psychiatry he would consistently call a “science.” Freud never abandoned his commitment to scientific knowledge and perhaps more importantly, scientific reason.

To read the Bible as wholeheartedly endorsing their ascetic program challenged the Fathers’ interpretive ingenuity as well as their comprehensive knowledge of Scripture. How, given the Bible’s sometime recalcitrance, could the lived experience of Christian renunciants find a Scriptural justification?

  Abstract: The epic poet builds a world into his poem and makes it palpable through passages of varying emotional timbre, now pastoral, now contemplative, now devotional, now celebratory, now tragic. But he builds that world as understandable in terms of the best information or knowledge available to him. Epic places human beings within a cosmos; Milton writes for an audience interested in that cosmos not simply as a storehouse for metaphor but as a structure under investigation by the liveliest minds of his age. He designs his diffuse epic to engage the interest of the seventeenth-century reader in geography, medicine, astronomy,<br>

  Abstract: However strongly we may see scientific ideas as socially and culturally contingent in their origin and expression, we must acknowledge that they are also the products of individuals. Hence even if we all consider scientific activity to be the reworking of prior scientific activity, the dynamics by which individual scientists develop their theories is a subject integral to the history of science. If we accept the proposition that knowledge grows by public and critical dialogue, we should not ignore the fact that important phases of the dialogue may occur within an individual. Such is the case for Charles Darwin, who<br>

  Abstract: William Elford Rogers proposes a genre-theory that will clarify what we mean when we speak of literary works as dramatic, epic, or lyric. Focusing on lyric poetry, this book maintains that the broad genre-concepts need not be discarded but can be preserved by a new interpretive model that gives us conceptual knowledge not about works but about interpretation.<br>

  Abstract: Adopting any model of literary interpretation plunges one at once into enormously involved philosophical problems. I have provisionally put forward a model on Heideggerian lines. But the model is Heideggerian
                  onlyin that it accepts Heidegger’s crucial notion that interpretation is a making-explicit of what is already grasped (“understood”), but not fully articulated, in our encounters with literary works. What concerns me here is something I have previously mentioned in passing—namely, the fact that a Heideggerian model might seem to lead inevitably to a strict relativism, and, therefore, to the conclusion that knowledge in the human studies is impossible.<br>

The romances still observe Renaissance social decorum, bestowing the most serious roles on the social elite and depicting them in greater numbers than their inferiors, in defiance of Jacobean social reality. In contrast to the tragedies, redemptive symbols in the late plays are vindicated, and hard won self-knowledge is cherished by cosmic hope. Yet the spiritually ennobling process we witness in the romances is largely confined to the upper classes,<br>

  Book Title: Scripture, Canon and Commentary-A Comparison of Confucian and Western Exegesis<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): HENDERSON JOHN B.<br>
  Abstract: In this major contribution to the study of the Chinese classics and comparative religion, John Henderson uses the history of exegesis to illuminate mental patterns that have universal and perennial significance for intellectual history. Henderson relates the Confucian commentarial tradition to other primary exegetical traditions, particularly the Homeric tradition, Vedanta, rabbinic Judaism, ancient and medieval Christian biblical exegesis, and Qur'anic exegesis. In making such comparisons, he discusses some basic assumptions common to all these traditions--such as that the classics or scriptures are comprehensive or that they contain all significant knowledge or truth and analyzes the strategies deployed to support these presuppositions. As shown here, primary differences among commentarial or exegetical traditions arose from variations in their emphasis on one or another of these assumptions and strategies. Henderson demonstrates that exegetical modes of thought were far from arcane: they dominated the post-classical/premodern intellectual world. Some have persisted or re-emerged in modern times, particularly in ideologies such as Marxism. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Scripture, Canon, and Commentary is not only a challenging interpretation of comparative scriptural traditions but also an excellent introduction to the study of the Confucian classics.<br>

This branch of knowledge is separated from the branch of the social sciences and from the branch of the biological and physical sciences.

This constriction occurred because human existence itself, and with it human knowledge, came to be seen as creatures of finite historical situations that could not recur. Human actions and feelings, confined to nonrecurring situations, could not teach by example; they were inimitable; they could not be reexperienced or performed by spectators.<br>

  Book Title: Living Prism-Itineraries in Comparative Literature<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KUSHNER EVA<br>
  Abstract: She discusses the current state of comparative literary studies and the renewed role of comparative literature in a world that is at once more plural and more globalized, as well as some of the debates now taking place within literary criticism as a whole, including the interchange between comparative literature and cultural studies, the re-envisaging of the Renaissance, the work of Northrop Frye, myth and literature at the end of the twentieth century, modern drama, and post-colonialism. To play an important role in the human sciences, comparative literature had first to free itself of a number of restrictive habits, such as an insufficiently critical literary history. In order to do this, it had to think theoretically, but without yielding to the temptation of letting theory become an end in itself. Kushner demonstrates that, while under strong pressures to be a more rigourous science, comparative literature has realized that in the human sciences the validation of knowledge has to seek its own tests and criteria, becoming increasingly more open to individuality, difference, and life situations and controlling its tendency to universalize. With its emphasis on whether literary history is possible and the problems it raises for literary theory and for comparative literature in particular, The Living Prism adds an important dimension to the ongoing debate about criticism and comparative literary studies.<br>

No matter how careful we are to treat the object of our study scientifically, it will at some point want to “speak” to us; such is its specificity.

  Author(s) Volpe Medi Ann<br>
  Abstract: In the nineteenth century, various themes arose to prominence within the mind of the church. Some surfaced from within, by the natural process of maturation and development, while others resulted from sharp reminders given by a rapidly changing secular world. Among these, perhaps the most significant, and that because its influence was so far-reaching, was the awakening to a sense of history.¹ This questioned fundamentally the prevailing certainties of knowledge, and had the potential to transform the intellectual disciplines completely. To become aware of historicity is to acknowledge a sense of contingency, pluralism, and the possibility of change. Much that<br>

  Abstract: Context matters. We can understand the words and actions of others only with knowledge of the contexts in which those words were spoken and those actions taken.

  Abstract: The authenticity of psychoanalytic knowledge can be measured by the change in awareness of the person being analysed,¹ just as the verifiability of group analytical findings is measured by the changes in the group with whom the group analyst works. That is why psychoanalytic or group analytic theory formation has to be related to case studies in order not to be speculative. Due to the brevity of this chapter I cannot undertake any full, systematic ethnohermeneutic reconstruction in the way I would prefer; therefore, I will have to confine myself to proposals, to some case studies published,² and to my<br>

According to Anthony Giddens, distinguishing features of modernity include a basic trust in the transformative potential of human agency and social institutions as well as new perceptions of determination and ambiguity that leave little room for religious cosmologies (1994: 36).

  Book Title: Melanesian Odysseys-Negotiating the Self, Narrative, and Modernity<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Josephides Lisette<br>
  Abstract: In a series of epic self-narratives ranging from traditional cultural embodiments to picaresque adventures, Christian epiphanies and a host of interactive strategies and techniques for living, Kewa Highlanders (PNG) attempt to shape and control their selves and their relentlessly changing world. This lively account transcends ethnographic particularity and offers a wide-reaching perspective on the nature of being human. Inverting the analytic logic of her previous work, which sought to uncover what social structures concealed, Josephides focuses instead on the cultural understandings that people make explicit in their actions and speech. Using approaches from philosophy and anthropology, she examines elicitation (how people create their selves and their worlds in the act of making explicit) and mimesis (how anthropologists produce ethnographies), to arrive at an unexpected conclusion: that knowledge of self and other alike derives from self-externalization rather than self-introspection.<br>

The same operations simultaneously negotiate understandings of cultural practices and social knowledge. Subsequent chapters will show how much of this activity is telescoped in the accounts that people give about themselves, their lives and their achievements. The importance of narrative, then, is from the outset analytically bound up with the human interactions that are central to this study.

  Book Title: Academic Anthropology and the Museum-Back to the Future<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Bouquet Mary<br>
  Abstract: The museum boom, with its accompanying objectification and politicization of culture, finds its counterpart in the growing interest by social scientists in material culture, much of which is to be found in museums. Not surprisingly, anthropologists in particular are turning their attention again to museums, after decades of neglect, during which fieldwork became the hallmark of modern anthropology - so much so that the "social" and the "material" parted company so radically as to produce a kind of knowledge gap between historical collections and the intellectuals who might have benefitted from working on these material representations of culture. Moreover it was forgotten that museums do not only present the "pastness" of things. A great deal of what goes on in contemporary museums is literally about planning the shape of the future: making culture materialize involves mixing things from the past, taking into account current visions, and knowing that the scenes constructed will shape the perspectives of future generations. However, the (re-)invention of museum anthropology presents a series of challenges for academic teaching and research, as well as for the work of cultural production in contemporary museums - issues that are explored in this volume.<br>

  Abstract: In
                  The conflict of interpretations(1974), Paul Ricoeur makes a distinction between three types of knowledge based on their different epistemological ascriptions. These distinctions provide a useful starting point for discussion about the variants of anthropological discourse and their relationship with what I have termed elsewhere, ‘the three museologies’ (Shelton 1995b: 7). Briefly, Ricoeur distinguishes between what we might call a culture’s operative discourses, disciplinary regimes of knowledge, and critical philosophy. This latter practice subjects the first two narrative forms to analytical scrutiny or, to use a postmodernist idiom, fields a sustained ‘incredulity to meta-narratives’ (Lyotard 1984: xxiv).

  Abstract: As we’ve often said in the past, historical research presents certain problems for the behavioural sciences. When we think about the history of education, can it, as the title of this book seems to suggest, be conceived of simply as a subdivision of educational research? And does the argumentative structure that is developed in this domain of knowledge automatically give rise to the construction of ‘one’, let alone, ‘the’ language of education?

  Book Title: Islam & Europe-Challenges and Opportunities<br>
  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): TIBI Bassam<br>
  Abstract: Dedicated to increasing our knowledge and awareness of the ever-growing diversity and pluralism of global society, Forum A. & A. Leysen has initiated an annual debate/lecture series, beginning with a focus on Islam in today's world and in Europe in particular. Seven well-known influential authorities - each an active participant in the public debate on the global role of Islam past, present and future - recently presented papers at the first Intercultural Relations Conference sponsored by Forum A.& A. Leysen. These important contributions, on the topic Islam and Europe: Challenges and Opportunities, are reprinted in this volume. Although each contributor speaks from his own distinctive point of view, a common message emerges from all seven texts: only dialogue - on the one hand between the West (countries that manifest themselves as Western Democratic constitutional states) and Islam, and on the other hand within and among societies historically identified with Islam- will overcome entrenched confrontation and negative animosity, engender new possibilities and understandings, and, by encouraging free and critical thinking, pave the way to social equity and the scientific innovation that, potentially, can lead to more prosperity. In the course of the conference all seven talks led to fascinating debates. This book includes the most important questions asked and the speakers' responses. Although the question of how to actually construct the dialogue remains unsettled, this ground-breaking book takes a giant step toward an answer.<br>

  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): SHAH Prakash<br>
  Abstract: Within the framework of the Forum A. & A Leysen, several experts from in and outside the Muslim world contributed to this book. In Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges they discuss how dialogues between Islam and the West, with a focus on Europe, can be achieved. The various authors (legal scholars, political theorists, social scientists, and psychologists) explore in these collected essays such interrelated questions as: How much diversity is permissible within a liberal pluralistic democratic society? How strong are the implications of citizenship? What are equitable accommodations of contested practices? They argue for an adequate understanding of how Western Muslim communities in Europe experience their minority position and what needs to be done to improve their participation in European society. The second part of this volume is a collection of papers written around the work of Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im, who also makes his own contribution to the book. The Catholic University of Leuven awarded An-Na'im an honorary doctorate in 2009 on the theme of multiculturalism, intercultural relations and diversity. An-Na'im is recognized the world over as a leading expert in the area of religion and law, and as a human rights activist. Islam and Europe: Crises Are Challenges reinforces our sense that a better knowledge and awareness of the growing diversity of our society, and striving for harmonious relations between Islam and the West, are among the most important challenges of our time.

  Book Title: Subversion, Conversion, Development-Cross-Cultural Knowledge Exchange and the Politics of Design<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Wilson Lee<br>
  Abstract: This book explores alternative cultural encounters with and around information technologies. These encounters are alternative because they counter dominant, Western-oriented notions of media consumption; they include media practices as forms of cultural resistance and subversion, "DIY cultures," and other nonmainstream models of technology production. The contributors -- leading thinkers in science and technology studies, anthropology, and software design -- pay special attention to the specific inflections that different cultures and communities give to the value of knowledge. The richly detailed accounts presented here challenge the dominant view of knowledge as a neutral good -- information available for representation and encoding but separated from all social relations. The chapters examine specific cases in which the forms of knowledge and cross-cultural encounters are shaping technology use and development. They consider design, use, and reuse of technological tools, including databases, GPS devices, books, and computers, in locations that range from Australia and New Guinea to Germany and the United States.ContributorsPoline Bala, Alan Blackwell, Wade Chambers, Michael Christie, Hildegard Diemberger, Stephen Hugh-Jones, James Leach, Jerome Lewis, Dawn Nafus, Gregers Petersen, Marilyn Strathern, David Turnbull, Helen Verran, Laura Watts, Lee Wilson<br>

Michael Polanyi, for example, famously pointed out that “we know more than we can tell.” He called this kind of knowledge “tacit knowledge”—the kind of acquired, taken-for-granted skills that are essential to using computers, for example (Polanyi 1958).

  Book Title: Scientific Understanding-Philosophical Perspectives<br>
  Publisher: University of Pittsburgh Press<br>
  Author(s): Eigner Kai<br>
  Abstract: To most scientists, and to those interested in the sciences, understanding is the ultimate aim of scientific endeavor. In spite of this, understanding, and how it is achieved, has received little attention in recent philosophy of science.
      Scientific Understandingseeks to reverse this trend by providing original and in-depth accounts of the concept of understanding and its essential role in the scientific process. To this end, the chapters in this volume explore and develop three key topics: understanding and explanation, understanding and models, and understanding in scientific practice.Earlier philosophers, such as Carl Hempel, dismissed understanding as subjective and pragmatic. They believed that the essence of science was to be found in scientific theories and explanations. In Scientific Understanding, the contributors maintain that we must also consider the relation between explanations and the scientists who construct and use them. They focus on understanding as the cognitive state that is a goal of explanation and on the understanding of theories and models as a means to this end.The chapters in this book highlight the multifaceted nature of the process of scientific research. The contributors examine current uses of theory, models, simulations, and experiments to evaluate the degree to which these elements contribute to understanding. Their analyses pay due attention to the roles of intelligibility, tacit knowledge, and feelings of understanding. Furthermore, they investigate how understanding is obtained within diverse scientific disciplines and examine how the acquisition of understanding depends on specific contexts, the objects of study, and the stated aims of research.<br>

Seeing is therefore a form of knowledge. Travel (whether actual or virtual) and acquisition of knowledge about the world are indelibly linked.

But with Michel Foucault and Thomas Szasz, Goffman popularised the view that they ought to be studied as social institutions that shaped medical knowledge. Szasz coined the terminstitutional pathologyto begin to understand what he called a misguided definition of (mental) illness. For him, institutions combined a general inability to usefully treat a mental illness with an explicit aim to<br>

  Abstract: CONTEMPORARY LATIN AMERICAN literature in the past two decades—the 1970s and 1980’s—reliably proves that the written word of women has contributed to the outlining and definition of a culture which challenges male hegemony as well as androcentric power relations and knowledge.² The breach that certain feminist and nonfeminist writers opened in the patriarchal culture allowed them, as a point of departure, to underline the fact that they were different from men. At the same time, they emphasized the historical cost of marginalization and took up the struggle for fair treatment.³ Soon after, they established certain epistemological bases for<br>

  Abstract: Although the Italians played a seminal role in the development of the Western civility tradition, it was during the reign of the French absolutist monarchs that civil etiquette became substantially associated with the preservation of privilege. The fact that egalitarian Protestantism was a minority movement in France allowed the French monarchs to adhere to an etiquette philosophy based on a social philosophy of distinction and superiority. In this chapter we would like to review the transition from etiquette to civility in France and discuss important aspects of French civil society prior to the twentieth century.

  Abstract: When it comes to the internal consciousness of time, the novel picks up where philosophy leaves off. But does the novel therefore

Perhaps knowledge of time is in some way the domain of philosophy, so that wherever it is that the novel goes with time, by being beyond the limits of philosophy, it cannot be an adventure in knowledge as such. There are two intimately related questions about knowledge involved in this. The first is the oldest question of all, the question of the relationship between philosophy and literature,<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Herrnstein Smith Barbara<br>
  Abstract: This book explores the radical reconceptions of knowledge and science emerging from constructivist epistemology, social studies of science, and contemporary cognitive science. Smith reviews the key issues involved in the twentieth-century critiques of traditional views of human knowledge and scientific truth and gives an extensively informed explanation of the alternative accounts developed by Fleck, Kuhn, Foucault, Latour, and others. She also addresses the various anxieties (e.g., over ‘relativism’) and ‘wars’ occasioned by these developments, placing them in their historical contexts and arguing that they are largely misplaced or spurious. Smith then examines the currently perplexed relations between the natural and human sciences, the grandiose claims and dubious methods of evolutionary psychology, and the complex play of naturalist, humanist, and posthumanist ideologies in contemporary views of the relation between humans and animals.<br>

Philosopher Michael Williams writes: ‘Is it possible to obtain knowledge

This is because thinking must be distinguished from knowledge or mental activity in general: remembering, sensing, imagining and so on. These modes of cognition remain at the purely empirical level of recognisable objects. Thought, however, goes beyond the limits of the recognisable and thus needs to be grasped in a way which distinguishes it from our day-to-day cognition of the world.¹ In other words, thought goes beyond the given differences which allow us to recognise the objects of our experience, and in turn leads towards a realm in which differences<br>

  Abstract: Anthropology’s engagement with the sensuous has shifted over the last century and a half from a concern with measuring bodies and recording sense data to an interest in sensing patterns, then from sensing patterns to reading texts, and finally from reading texts to writing culture. In the course of the latter shifts, the content of anthropological knowledge has changed from being multisensory and social to being spectacularly stylized and centered on the individual ethnographer. The result is that ethnographic authority now depends more on the “reflexivity” with which one writes than the accuracy with which one “represents” a culture (e.g.,<br>

From the sociological standpoint of Elizabeth Burns the “theatrical metaphor” generated conventions that served as constitutive agreements for knowledge.¹ Yet this metaphor is also, for her, a “mode of perception,” a basic phenomenological category like those described by Ernst Cassirer or Susanne K.

The book builds on the work of linguistics, semiotics, narratology, and discourse theory and examines numerous literary works and narrative "vignettes" of medical problems, situations, and encounters. Throughout, the book presents usable expositions of the ways storytelling organizes itself to allow physicians and other healthcare workers (and even patients themselves) to be more attentive to and self-conscious about the information---the "narrative knowledge"---of the patient's story.<br>

  Abstract: Amid the most basic premises of

  Abstract: The previous chapter investigated the ways in which a selection of string theory popularizations makes an abstract theoretical space accessible through a pedagogical space. Within these string theory popularizations access becomes an imaginative mode that works to distinguish what theorists mark as novel in that space; in particular, images of strings and branes, from what the theorists frame as established yet incomplete knowledge of the cosmos. But on closer scrutiny, this novel string theoretical imaginary betrays, like the exposition within string theory technical discourse, its own incoherences. A radical heterogeneity arises from the way popularizations blend a multitude of string<br>

  Book Title: Archives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memory-Essays from the Sawyer Seminar<br>
  Publisher: University of Michigan Press<br>
  Author(s): Rosenberg William G.<br>
  Abstract: As sites of documentary preservation rooted in various national and social contexts, artifacts of culture, and places of uncovering, archives provide tangible evidence of memory for individuals, communities, and states, as well as defining memory institutionally within prevailing political systems and cultural norms. By assigning the prerogatives of record keeper to the archivist, whose acquisition policies, finding aids, and various institutionalized predilections mediate between scholarship and information, archives produce knowledge, legitimize political systems, and construct identities. Far from being mere repositories of data, archives actually embody the fragments of culture that endure as signifiers of who we are, and why. The essays in A
      rchives, Documentation, and Institutions of Social Memoryconceive of archives not simply as historical repositories but as a complex of structures, processes, and epistemologies situated at a critical point of the intersection between scholarship, cultural practices, politics, and technologies.<br>

  Author(s) Ananich Boris V.<br>
  Abstract: This essay is about the colonial order of things as seen through its archival productions. It asks what insights about the colonial might be gained from attending not only to colonialism’s archival content but to its particular and sometimes peculiar form. Its focus is on archiving as a process rather than archives as things. It looks to archives as epistemological experiments rather than as sources—to colonial archives as cross-sections of contested knowledge. Most important, I want to suggest that colonial archives were both transparencies on which power relations were inscribed and intricate technologies of rule in themselves. The essay’s<br>

  Book Title: The Science of the Soul in Colonial New England-  Publisher: The University of North Carolina Press<br>
  Author(s): RIVETT SARAH<br>
  Abstract: The Science of the Soulchallenges long-standing notions of Puritan provincialism as antithetical to the Enlightenment. Sarah Rivett demonstrates that, instead, empiricism and natural philosophy combined with Puritanism to transform the scope of religious activity in colonial New England from the 1630s to the Great Awakening of the 1740s.In an unprecedented move, Puritan ministers from Thomas Shepard and John Eliot to Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards studied the human soul using the same systematic methods that philosophers applied to the study of nature. In particular, they considered the testimonies of tortured adolescent girls at the center of the Salem witch trials, Native American converts, and dying women as a source of material insight into the divine. Conversions and deathbed speeches were thus scrutinized for evidence of grace in a way that bridged the material and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the worldly and the divine.In this way, the "science of the soul" was as much a part of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century natural philosophy as it was part of post-Reformation theology. Rivett's account restores the unity of religion and science in the early modern world and highlights the role and importance of both to transatlantic circuits of knowledge formation.<br>

  Abstract: The dangers of misapplied science, fully realized in the Salem witchcraft trials and the events’ larger context in Royal Society debates, put tremendous pressure on the science of the soul. By the late-seventeenth century, Harvard-trained ministers and Royal Society natural philosophers continued to advance their practices, though with renewed caution, aware both of mechanical philosophy’s limitations and the parameters surrounding empirical inquiry—especially interdictions against studying preternatural phenomena. Yet neither New England ministers nor London natural philosophers abandoned efforts to apply empirical methods to advance knowledge of God. Rather, such theologians as Samuel Clarke recuperated the goal of knowing the<br>

  Book Title: Moving Consciously-Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch<br>
  Publisher: University of Illinois Press<br>
  Author(s): Fraleigh Sondra<br>
  Abstract: The popularity of yoga and Zen meditation has heightened awareness of somatic practices. Individuals develop the conscious embodiment central to somatics work via movement and dance, or through touch from a skilled teacher or therapist often called a somatic bodyworker. Methods of touch and movement foster generative processes of consciousness in order to create a fluid interconnection between sensation, thought, movement, and expression. In Moving Consciously , Sondra Fraleigh gathers essays that probe ideas surrounding embodied knowledge and the conscious embodiment of movement and dance. Using a variety of perspectives on movement and dance somatics, Fraleigh and other contributors draw on scholarship and personal practice to participate in a multifaceted investigation of a thriving worldwide phenomenon. Their goal: to present the mental and physical health benefits of experiencing one's inner world through sensory awareness and movement integration. A stimulating addition to a burgeoning field, Moving Consciously incorporates concepts from East and West into a timely look at life-changing, intertwined practices that involve dance, movement, performance studies, and education.

  Abstract: The study of somatics offers many layers of learning, from the simplest focusing of attention to the cultivation of a deeper sense of self. Somatic study is concerned with experiencing the self from an internal perspective, inviting students to feel, acknowledge, and respond to inner and outer sensations and to consciously participate in attending to, and taking responsibility for, themselves. Developing self-awareness and self-knowledge through somatic processes can allow us to find release, ease, and clarity both physically and emotionally, and can give us choice and freedom to explore new possibilities in our approach to life.<br>

Debates and reflection on the subject are most extensive and intensive within the discipline of history itself, particularly among those scholars who, recognizing that the historian’s craft extends beyond the mere “reconstruction” of what “actually” happened, deploy more complex modes of analysis in their work. An initial complexity emerges from the recognition that what “actually happened” includes the subjective perceptions and experiences of social actors.

  Author(s) Godzich Wlad<br>
  Abstract: When Tzvetan Todorov coined the term “narratology” in 1969 to designate the study of narrative he was responding to the then widespread belief that narrative was particularly amenable to being elevated to the status of an object of knowledge for a new science armed with its own concepts and analytic protocols. He was also responding to the hope, or perhaps more accurately, the desire, to lift all of literary and cultural studies to the dignity of science, a desire that strongly animated French structuralism. Todorov’s programmatic enthusiasm seemed warranted then: whereas the previous half-century had been punctuated by occasional studies<br>

  Abstract: Life is lived looking forward, but it is told looking backward. Whether invented or experienced, events are normally emplotted retrospectively. Knowledge of the outcome shapes the narrator’s selection and evaluation of the preceding states and events; the crisis to be highlighted determines the exposition and the complication; the point to be made specifies the arguments to be used. While the laws of material causality operate forward, the laws of narrative, artistic, textual, or more generally of communicative causality operate overwhelmingly backward.<br>

The eclectic iconography of the Quays’ cinematic world—its meandering narrative structures and unique cosmogony—hinders an assured or exclusive classification to a genre or a movement. If anything, their works belong to a hybrid category of poetic-experimental film that operates at a liminal threshold between live action and animation.

  Abstract: The concept of pathology derives from ancient medicine, where it refers to the doctrine of kinds and causes of illness. According to Galen, the pathological is what deviates from “the normal course of nature” (Seidler 1989, 13). Discourse about social pathologies, in turn, stems from the metaphorical transferring of this medical concept onto societies—which are treated as if they were organisms that can be sick or healthy. Habermas’s reading of Freud, in
                  Knowledge and Human Interests, is decisive for the conception of pathology in his works as a whole. For Freud, pathology is based on the linguistification or verbalization<br>

  Author(s): HOUSER HEATHER<br>
  Abstract: Tracing the development of ecosickness through a compelling archive of modern U.S. novels and memoirs, this study demonstrates the mode's crucial role in shaping thematic content and formal and affective literary strategies. Examining works by David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, Leslie Marmon Silko, Marge Piercy, Jan Zita Grover, and David Wojnarowicz, Heather Houser shows how these authors unite experiences of environmental and somatic damage through narrative affects that draw attention to ecological phenomena, organize perception, and convert knowledge into ethics. Traversing contemporary cultural studies, ecocriticism, affect studies, and literature and medicine, Houser juxtaposes ecosickness fiction against new forms of environmentalism and technoscientific innovations such as regenerative medicine and alternative ecosystems.

Celebrating the life-giving potential of people, places, and powers that lie beyond our established worlds,

  Book Title: The Awakened Ones-Phenomenology of Visionary Experience<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Obeyesekere Gananath<br>
  Abstract: Throughout his career, Obeyesekere has combined psychoanalysis and anthropology to illuminate the relationship between personal symbolism and religious experience. In this book, he begins with Buddha's visionary trances wherein, over the course of four hours, he witnesses hundreds of thousands of his past births and eons of world evolution, renewal, and disappearance. He then connects this fracturing of empirical and visionary time to the realm of space, considering the experience of a female Christian penitent, who stares devotedly at a tiny crucifix only to see the space around it expand to mirror Christ's suffering. Obeyesekere follows the unconscious motivations underlying rapture, the fantastical consumption of Christ's body and blood, and body mutilation and levitation, bridging medieval Catholicism and the movements of early modern thought as reflected in William Blake's artistic visions and poetic dreams. He develops the term "dream-ego" through a discussion of visionary journeys, Carl Jung's and Sigmund Freud's scientific dreaming, and the cosmic and erotic dream-visions of New Age virtuosos, and he defines the parameters of a visionary mode of knowledge that provides a more elastic understanding of truth. A career-culminating work, this volume translates the epistemology of Hindu and Buddhist thinkers for western audiences while revitalizing western philosophical and scientific inquiry.<br>

Further, the flexibility of their Mahāyāna Buddhism was such that they could journey into unfamiliar cosmic realms, and to known or little-known geographic regions, to interpret in retrospect unusual visions, like that of the wolf rider and<br>

  Abstract: Shoulson is unconvinced of a direct link between a specific collection of rabbinic writings and Milton's works. He argues that many of Milton's poetic ideas that parallel midrash are likely to have entered Christian discourse not only through early modern Christian Hebraicists but also through Protestant writers and preachers without special knowledge of Hebrew. At the heart of Shoulson's inquiry lies a fundamental question: When is an idea, a theme, or an emphasis distinctively Judaic or Hebraic and when is it Christian? The difficulty in answering such questions reveals and highlights the fluid interaction between ostensibly Jewish, Hellenistic, and Christian modes of thought not only during the early modern period but also early in time when rabbinic Judaism and Christianity began.<br>

With few exceptions, these events marked painful losses: the destruction of the Temple and the ensuing loss of political power within the Roman Empire on the one hand, the Restoration of the English monarchy and the disempowerment of more radical embodiments of Protestantism on the other.

  Author(s): BASSO ELLEN B.<br>
  Abstract: An especially comprehensive study of Brazilian Amazonian Indian history, The Last Cannibals is the first attempt to understand, through indigenous discourse, the emergence of Upper Xingú society. Drawing on oral documents recorded directly from the native language, Ellen Basso transcribes and analyzes nine traditional Kalapalo stories to offer important insights into Kalapalo historical knowledge and the performance of historical narratives within their nonliterate society. This engaging book challenges the familiar view of biography as a strictly Western literary form. Of special interest are biographies of powerful warriors whose actions led to the emergence of a more recent social order based on restrained behaviors from an earlier time when people were said to be fierce and violent. From these stories, Basso explores how the Kalapalo remember and understand their past and what specific linguistic, psychological, and ideological materials they employ to construct their historical consciousness. Her book will be important reading in anthropology, folklore, linguistics, and South American studies.<br>

  Abstract: Since the early 1990s hundreds of thousands of Tamil villagers in southern India have participated in literacy lessons, science demonstrations, and other events designed to transform them into active citizens with access to state power.

In

  Abstract: Artifice is older than the arts of design, the plastic arts of drawing, painting, and sculpting, but the passage through these arts (their technical problems, especially how to imitate visual cues in different media) was decisive for the reorganization of technics as an economy of knowledge. We learned what design can do for artifice. The artistic accomplishment of Upper Paleolithic cave painting (figure 1.1) is a moment of a wider technical achievement that includes the design of tools, which become at once better engineered and more appealing to vision. The result is not technology right away, though in retrospect we<br>

  Abstract: I began the previous chapter with a brief discussion of the constructivist account of historical writing. Most practicing historians will tend to be skeptical of it. They will protest that the constructivist’s claim that our knowledge of the past is a mere construction based on existing evidence is a most unjust caricature of their discipline. And the idea that the past itself is no ingredient in the process of the acquisition of historical knowledge they will condemn as simply preposterous. In contrast to such interpretations of their discipline, they ordinarily consider their journeys through the past with just as much<br>

  Book Title: Aesthetic Vision and German Romanticism-Writing Images<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Prager Brad<br>
  Abstract: The work of the groundbreaking writers and artists of German Romanticism -- including the writers Tieck, Brentano, and Eichendorff and the artists Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge -- followed from the philosophical arguments of the German Idealists, who placed emphasis on exploring the subjective space of the imagination. The Romantic perspective was a form of engagement with Idealist discourses, especially Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and Fichte's Science of Knowledge. Through an aggressive, speculative reading of Kant, the Romantics abandoned the binary distinction between the palpable outer world and the ungraspable space of the mind's eye and were therefore compelled to develop new terms for understanding the distinction between "internal" and "external." In this light, Brad Prager urges a reassessment of some of Romanticism's major oppositional tropes, contending that binaries such as "self and other," "symbol and allegory," and "light and dark," should be understood as alternatives to Lessing's distinction between interior and exterior worlds. Prager thus crosses the boundaries between philosophy, literature, and art history to explore German Romantic writing about visual experience, examining the interplay of text and image in the formulation of Romantic epistemology. Brad Prager is Associate Professor of German at the University of Missouri, Columbia.<br>

  Book Title: Forgotten Dreams-Revisiting Romanticism in the Cinema of Werner Herzog<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Johnson Laurie Ruth<br>
  Abstract: Werner Herzog (b. 1942) is perhaps the most famous living German filmmaker, but his films have never been read in the context of German cultural history. And while there is a surfeit of film reviews, interviews, and scholarly articles on Herzog and his work, there are very few books devoted to his films, and none addressing his entire career to date. Until now. Forgotten Dreams offers not only an analytical study of Herzog's films but also a new reading of Romanticism's impact beyond the nineteenth century. It argues that his films re-envision and help us better understand a critical stream in Romanticism, and places the films in conversation with other filmmakers, authors, and philosophers in order to illuminate that critical stream. The result is a lively reconnection with Romantic themes and convictions that have been partly forgotten in the midst of Germany's postwar rejection of much of Romantic thought, yet are still operative in German culture today. The film analyses will interest scholars of film, German Studies, and Romanticism as well as a broader public interested in Herzog's films and contemporary German cultural debates. The book will also appeal to those interested in the ongoing renegotiation - by Western and other cultures - of relationships between reason and passion, civilization and wild nature, knowledge and belief.

  Abstract: Narratives make “meaningful totality” out of a myriad of events.¹ Therefore they play a very important role in the struggle for control and full participation in whatever is constituted as a “totality”—particularly a political totality expressive in ethnic or ethno-national boundaries. In constructing a meaningful totality out of the mess of political life, narratives invite other narratives to validate or invalidate them. Therefore, no single narrative is adequate in representing the political world.

Embodied, performative forms of knowledge represented one response to the desire to physically touch the past. The

  Abstract: The title “father of modern philosophy” (

By introducing mathematical methods into philosophy, Descartes founded the rationalist tradition in epistemology (the theory of knowledge and its objects), which holds that all knowledge of reality is ultimately derived from the exercise of human reason according to foundational principles independent of the senses. The rationalist position, which in Germany was taken up by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), Christian Wolff (1679–1754), and Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–62), gave philosophical underpinnings to the European intellectual movement<br>

According to Nietzsche, the spontaneous appeal of rhythm and melody evoke a primal sense of unity with life and with the greater whole in which life is imbedded.

For Treuer, this Wenabozho story moreover allegorizes the quest for “authentic Indigenous culture” that so often impels readers, critics, and even authors in the field of Indigenous literature. Smartberries—discrete, displaced packets of cultural knowledge—are but signs of the literature’s desire for a holistic, tribally specific cultural understanding, and should not be mistaken for an end in themselves.<br>

  Abstract: Within the strongly empiricist framework of American social science, there is very little acknowledgment of the nonempirical, theoretically driven dimension of scientific change. Yet the major developments in social science do not emerge primarily from simple accumulation of empirical knowledge or from proving previous theories false. They grow from confrontations with other, hegemonic theories. These confrontations, which are often intense and highly emotional, may take the form of critical experiments that crystallize and operationalize more general commitments, but they usually also present themselves as more general, less empirical arguments about theoretical logic itself.<br>

The regime’s ideologically distorted self-image is of interest to historiography as an extreme case in which historical knowledge is subject to direct politicization and ideologization in legitimating power.

  Book Title: Given World and Time-Temporalities in Context<br>
  Publisher: Central European University Press<br>
  Author(s): Miller Tyrus<br>
  Abstract: The interconnections of time with historical thought and knowledge have come powerfully to the fore since the 1970s. An international group of scholars, from a range of fields including literary theory, history of ideas, cultural anthropology, philosophy, intellectual history and theology, philology, and musicology, address the matter of time and temporalities. The volume’s essays, divided into four main topical groups question critically the key problem of context, connecting it to the problem of time. Contexts, the essays suggest, are not timeless. Time and its contexts are only partly “given” to us: to the primordial donations of time and world correspond our epistemic, moral, and practical modes of receiving what has been granted. The notion of context may have radically different parameters in different historical, cultural, and disciplinary situations. Topics include the deep antiquity, and the timeless time of eternity, as well as formal philosophies of history and the forms of histories implicit in individual and community experience. The medium specific use of time and history are examined with regard to song, image, film, oral narration, and legal discourse.<br>

Abstract: One of the most difficult and important questions regarding the uses of animals in research is the question of whether there ought to be restrictions on the uses of animals in exemplary basic research. Where the research is clearly pursuing important scientific questions but is invasive, the costs to animals are high and the potential benefits to knowledge are also high, but often unknown. Orlans et al. do indeed raise this question (p. 80) but unfortunately choose to raise it in the context of a case which is, at best, notorious and questionable: the Gennarelli head injury experiments. In these experiments researchers can be seen violating state and federal laws, performing procedures which violate their own research protocols, and ridiculing the animals. While the general interest of this case warrants discussion on many other grounds, surely, there are better examples of scientific research which might have been used in discussing the important issue of basic research.<br>

Abstract: In short, our present brains enclose another brain, destined to develop in the afterlife and to restore our identity, personality, and body together.
         112Since the resurrected body will be spiritual and incorruptible, the “small human body” hidden in the seat of the soul must be physically different from our bodies of flesh. Indeed, it is “that spiritual body which Revelation contrasts to the animal body that is only its envelope.”113But differences are secondary. Althoughbodyas such is essentially for identity, it is not through the numerical sameness of terrestrial and spiritual bodies that human beings will prolong their earthly past. Hence the limits of psycho‐theology. “The psychologist,” Bonnet wrote of himself, “who treats of human permanence [after death] must investigateanalyticallyhow the future state will relate to the past state, and by what physical means man will conserve his personality and all the knowledge [connaissances] he acquired in his terrestrial state” (

There is a widespread misunderstanding, if not prejudice, that identifies cognition with an individual and therefore nonsocial approach to language and discourse. This is the case in ethnomethodology, ethnography, and sociolinguistics as well as in much critical discourse analysis. Duranti mentions cognitive anthropology only in passing, and although this may not be the best example of an integrated study of cognition, interaction, and social context in anthropology and discourse studies, a study of language and discourse without an explicit cognitive basis is empirically and theoretically reductionist and hence inadequate. Ignorance of cognitive and social psychology, artificial intelligence, and related disciplines leaves a prominent gap precisely where a link must be construed between societal structures, social situations, and interactions, on the one hand, and the structures and strategies of text and talk, on the other. Social situations, interactions, or context as such cannot possibly influence discourse (and vice versa) without a sociocognitive interface. And, as is obvious in the relevance of the study of knowledge, attitudes, social representations, and ideologies, cognitions may be as social as they are mental. In sum, cognition, especially social cognition, is too important and too interesting to be left to psychologists, and as much as social scientists and discourse analysts can and should learn from them, they should learn from a more sociocultural approach to language and discourse.<br>

Abstract: If you would really like to know what makes us think, you will not get the answer by reading this book—the title is just a misnomer. The volume is a good after‐hours read on the views and exchanges of two prominent researchers, Jean‐Pierre Changeux, a neuroscientist, and Paul Ricoeur, a philosopher. They argue about a lot of issues, from evolution to brain to ethics, rarely reaching an agreement on the role of modern‐age neuroscience in shaping human values and experience. Changeux envisions an overarching role of neuroscience on human affairs. He writes, “[t]he knowledge that we are now in the process of piecing together about the human brain ought to allow us to have a clearer idea—I am perhaps overly optimistic—of the direction in which we wish to see human society develop” (p 27). Ricoeur holds steadfastly to every millimeter occupied by the totality of human experience and its unique value, seeing no special role in it for neuroscience
      qua neuroscience. For example, the authors engage in the following exchange: “Changeux: … Today … I think that observational methods make it possible to obtain physical facts about subjective psychological states. A physics of introspection may even be possible. Are we in agreement on this point? Ricoeur: In humans a function is not reducible to an observable behavior.… There is a hermeneutics of daily life that gives introspection the dimension of an interpersonal practice.… This is what I find expressed in the phrasefor intérieur,one’s heart of hearts—literally, a ‘forum’ in which one speaks to oneself. This heart of hearts has its own particular status that it would appear you will never succeed in explaining in your science. And so my answer to your question is no” (pp 67–69).<br>

Abstract: Nature likewise teaches me by these sensations of pain, hunger, thirst, etc., that I am not only lodged in my body as a pilot in a vessel, but that I am besides so intimately conjoined, and as it were intermixed with it, that my mind and body compose a certain unity. For if this were not the case, I should not feel pain when my body is hurt, seeing I am merely a thinking thing, but should perceive the wound by the understanding alone, just as a pilot perceives by sight when any part of his vessel is damaged; and when my body has need of food or drink, I should have a clear knowledge of this, and not be made aware of it by the confused sensations of hunger and thirst: for, in truth, all these sensations of hunger, thirst, pain, etc., are nothing more than certain confused modes of thinking, arising from the union and apparent fusion of mind and body.

Abstract: The incomprehensibility of the human being remains. Founded and required by the incomprehensibility of the One whose image and likeness man bears, it is bound up with theology. Nevertheless it does not belong entirely, or even foremost, to theology, because man must comprehend this very incomprehensibility, by opposing it to, and preserving it in front of, every other comprehension that he gains over every other thing—things that can become objects. Let us recall here Paul Ricœur’s brilliant statement: “the claim by knowledge to constitute itself raises the most formidable obstacle to the idea of revelation. In this regard, Husserl’s transcendental idealism potentially contains the very same atheistic outcome as Feuerbach’s idealism of self‐consciousness.”
         46In this sense, which is first of all negative, or rather denegatory, man’s incomprehensibility comes under the domain of philosophy.<br>

Author(s): Nicholson Hugh<br>
Abstract: An increase in knowledge and religious sensitivity has thus revealed the representations of the religious “other” in opposition to which Christianity has traditionally defined itself to be little more than projections of an underlying desire to establish religious identity.
         59Thoughtful comparison exposes this basic need to establish religious identity by invalidating many of the representations through which this need has been at once expressed and concealed. We might say that comparative theology represents the demythologization of apologetics, where demythologization is understood in Rudolf Bultmann’s sense as the recognition of an expressive function underneath an appearance of objective description. So just as Bultmann sought to demythologize the New Testament by explicating the mode of being‐in‐the‐world expressed through a mythical world picture,60so too the comparative theologian recognizes the expressive intent beneath the often questionable comparisons of traditional apologetics. The analogy with Bultmann’s demythologization project calls attention to a point about this conception of comparative theology that brings it into line with Clooney’s, namely, that it does not imply an outright rejection of apologetics. Comparative theology can be regarded as the attempt to salvage what is legitimate in apologetics, namely, the desire to preserve the integrity of a particular religious community by establishing its cognitive boundaries. This conception of comparative theology as a demythologized apologetics thus acknowledges the legitimacy of a sociopolitical dimension to religion. Through judicious comparisons, comparative theology brings into relief the defining features of the Christian community. Yet this aspect of comparative theology differs from traditional apologetics in that it distinguishes a desire to define the Christian faith from a perceived need to refute the teachings of other faith communities. To the extent that comparative theology succ~<br>

Author(s): Robbins,  Jeffrey W.<br>
Abstract: After this historical, critical section, Robbins develops a more constructive approach toward a philosophical theology that capitalizes on the ontotheological condition. He claims as his models Paul Ricoeur and, ultimately, Jean‐Luc Marion and Emmanuel Lévinas. Understanding Ricoeur’s hermeneutics “according to the model of religious orthodoxy in which faith and practice translate into knowledge” (p. 123), Robbins praises Ricoeur for offering a model of philosophical theology but criticizes this model because, like all orthodoxy, the philosophy remains uncritical of its foundations—that is, of the religion to which it gives conceptual formulation. Another model of philosophical theology is provided by Marion and Lévinas. In Marion, Robbins asserts, phenomenology and theology each pass into the other in such a way that there is not a confusion or reduction but a mutual criticism and modification of each by the other (p. 113). Marion’s supposed embrace of the ontotheological dialogue between philosophy and theology is foreshadowed, according to Robbins, in Lévinas, who first modeled “an alternative strategy for contemporary philosophical and theological thought … a strategy that is
      otherwise than overcoming” (p. 132).<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since h~<br>

Abstract: But with regard to philosophy, we could give prominence to the process whereby the domain of human knowledge operates as an organically integrated, self‐sustaining whole. We could do this because we value the health of the processes themselves, by which I mean semantic innovation at the levels of word, narrative, and library, whereby the operations of reading and imagining mediate in the constitution of individual lives. Arguably, no other profession has this brief. It could also be said that we already practice as if these narrative theories are true.<br>

Abstract: It is fitting to conclude my speculations on the disruptiveness of localization to the race/gender/sexuality analogy by briefly examining Haraway’s analytics of race in
         Modest_Witness@Second_Millenium(1997a). Although the essay on race, “Race: Universal Donors in a Vampire Culture” (1997b), begins with a numbingly familiar series of analogies—“Race, like nature and sex, is replete with all kinds of rituals of guilt and innocence in the stories of nation, family, and species … race, like sex, is about the purity of lineage; the legitimacy of passage” (213)—the bulk of the essay derives its interpretive impetus from historically specific articulations. Through a table that periodizes twentieth‐century kinship categories through key objects of knowledge—race, population, and the genome—in three periods in the twentieth century, Haraway both contextualizes the categories of race, sex, and nature and suggests related discontinuities and unfamiliar connections along the chart by seeing the chart as a hypertext. The most insightful of Haraway’s observations derive from rigorous localized analysis. Thus Haraway demonstrates both the humanist impulse behind the Human Genome Project and the raced, colonial workings through which indigenous peoples were once again the objects of knowledge rather than partners in a research agenda (1997b, 249).<br>

Date: 10 2005<br>
Author(s): Maggi Armando<br>
Abstract: Although Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden, the human race still retains a deformed perception of God’s original “metaphor.” “Beatification,” Tesauro explains, is the mind’s “reformation,” that is, man’s transformation from stained glass to clear mirror of God’s “metaphor,” the Word. God’s Only Begotten is the original metaphor who, when he became incarnate, transformed himself into a new “figure,” for he turned into the image and likeness of God. Later, after his resurrection, he returned to the Father as a new “transfigured” image. Augustine may help clarify this point of Tesauro’s reasoning. In
      De trinitate, Augustine offers an exhaustive analysis of his fundamental view of the “reformation” of man’s image‐likeness to the Word as the Father’s “figure.” The mind, Augustine contends, has a trinitarian structure analogous to God’s Trinity.44Consciousness (memoria) relates to the Father, knowledge (intelligentia) to the Son, and love (amor) to the Holy Spirit. Throughmemoriathe mind initiates a process of reformation, which can only occur “according to the image of God” (secundum imaginem Dei).45In Augustine’s view, our mind will perfectly conform to the image of God (it will become its perfect mirror) only at Doomsday.46One could infer that, according to Augustine, the mind’s process of reformation is an act of listening to the Father’s “figure of speech,” the Word, so that the mind can conform to his discourse.<br>

Author(s): Young III William W.<br>
Abstract: As Frei discusses in
         The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative, the study of philology and the grammar of scripture has been a central component of redaction and historical criticism. By and large, grammatical study has examined the language of scripture in light of the uses of language in the historical settings in which texts were written. Grammatical analysis took the form of historical analysis of the verbal forms used in the composition of the texts; as Frei writes of Johann Philipp Gabler, it “meant working out from a text’s words, as used at the time they were written, and the single, and never more than single, meaning of the text and its author, quite regardless of one’s estimate of the soundness of his position.”37This single, ostensive meaning of words, in association with the world of the author, subsequently permeated historical‐critical studies, dogmatic theology, and hermeneutics. This historical determination of grammatical meaning comes to fruition in the work of Schleiermacher, whose hermeneutics oscillated dialectically between the poles of psychological, “technical” interpretation and grammatical interpretation. Grammatical understanding involves understanding “the discourse as a focus within a language as a whole, characterized by its relation to the total linguistic stock” of the author, for whose completion, quoting Schleiermacher, “there would have to be a complete knowledge of the language.”38While grammatical interpretation is necessary, and always remains incomplete, the “divinatory” element of psychological interpretation governs and guides the interpretation, leading the reader to the text’s meaning, in knowing the author better than she knows herself.<br>

Abstract: The studies following the trichotomy of exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism all recapitulate the arguments for and against the first two models and weigh the pros and cons. However, the third model, pluralism, is not evaluated in terms of positive and negative aspects but mainly in comparison with the other two models, while attracting a flood of criticism. There is no point dealing with this in detail—one can read it anywhere. Let me merely sum up the gist of it. A cardinal objection is the cultural and religious relativism allegedly evinced by the model of pluralism: Christianity and the other religions are all just vehicles of knowledge about, and devotion to, God, contextually confined as they are both temporally and spatially. The cultural relativism evident in this view inevitably leads to religious relativism, which is incompatible with Christianity’s claims, not merely to universality but also to uniqueness and absoluteness. Christianity not only has a universal message for all peoples in all ages; that message also contains the unique truth, transmitted to us only through the unique, divine person of Jesus the Christ; and this truth is also absolute, not to be experienced by any other religion. That, in a nutshell, is the critique of pluralism in the Vatican document

Abstract: Ibid., 298. The field of memory studies is still underdeveloped, although most efforts today are concentrated in the direction of neurobiology. Some research circles have revived the ancient idea of a memory trace, which preserves the information received from experience. Only when there is activation of such a trace does the highly specific causal connection occur that is required for true remembering. Others contest this idea, based on the very little knowledge we have about the physiological processes involving the memory of specific events. They insist that memory is highly dispersed in alternative neural networks rather than encoded in specific brain cells.<br>

Abstract: Human community under such fragile circumstances constantly devolves into a community of mere difference alone. The original sin, from a poetic point of view, is the failure to embrace our own deeper capabilities for creating ever more inclusive social worlds. The possibility for a living creative tension among others is on some level always already defeated by the use of human creative faculties in merely limited ways, by historical stasis and consolidations of power, and by all too human anxieties that leave us naked and ashamed before one another. In symbolic terms, the invisible “fruitfulness” of social generativity in the image of a Creator is inevitably (if understandably) overcome by the idolatrous temptation of the visible “fruit” of a fixed and tangible “knowledge of good and evil.” The products of creative life are mistaken for creative life itself. Moral uncreativity is perhaps similar in this respect to bad literature: repetitive of worn‐out clichés (as also in Hannah Arendt’s description of the overwhelming reliance on clichés by Adolf Eichmann), lacking a more inclusive movement and tension, or uninvested with openness to larger and wider meaning.
         35In any case, the challenge for us morally creative beings is to turn tensions of fear and division in human relations into tensions of inclusive production and multiplication. It is to imitate the Creator’s perfect Sabbath, which is no mere final stasis but a living harmony of the ongoing differences between night and day, land and water, plants and animals, and the whole Creation in all its marvelous and interacting diversity. The expulsion from the Garden of Eden is a loss, from this perspective, not of placid amoral inactivity but of the vital capability for generating, on the basis of human multiplicity and otherness, an ever more complex and diverse narrative of humankind.<br>

Abstract: To my modest knowledge, this rapprochement of economics and virtue ethics is quite novel. Ricoeur makes an important opening in this direction. As is characteristic of this chapter, the endeavor is to unearth an “anthropological base” at the foundation of the capabilities approach: “What is important is our having discovered reinforcement for a concept of human action as rooted in a fundamental anthropology” (146). But, as I have said earlier, I believe this anthropology is faulty if it insists on understanding action in a precommunicative way.<br>

Abstract: A recent article by Martin Frické, Kay Mathiesen, and Don Fallis [
         22] reviews some examinations of the LBR that argue that it is ambiguous and political and emphasizes censorship while underemphasizing intellectual property rights and patron privacy. They then contend that, given a philosophical foundation of fallibilism (no knowledge is absolutely certain, and there is the possibility of correction), some of the tenets of the LBR are problematic. They point in particular to Articles II, III, and V. The third article, for example, prohibits censorship; the authors raise the question of what should be done when one right (the right to free expression) conflicts with another right (say, to privacy). Their questioning is reflected in the first scenario presented above. At that point of conflict, a decision must be made, and the LBR does not address such conflict directly. Some interpretations of the LBR do address privacy rights but from the standpoint of access to information and patron records rather than from the standpoint of the content of the information carriers. Frické and his colleagues urge that social‐contract theory be the basis for considering intellectual freedom within the context of the LBR. Building upon Rawls’s conception of rights, they argue that, while some individuals have an idea of the good, “it may be that not all conceptions of the good should be accommodated, by means of the principle chosen for distributing information in society. If we contemplated from behind the veil of ignorance the possibility that we might be placed in society as child pornographers, perhaps we would desire society to supply the means for sympathetic understanding and medical help, rather than public libraries full of child pornography” [22, p. 482].<br>

Abstract: Responsibility for and to this double heritage then requires the invention, each time anew, of a rule according to which both contradictory demands could be met simultaneously or of an action from which such a rule could, after the fact, be construed. In Patočka’s parlance, such responsibility toward the memory of Europe is, therefore, inevitably heretical. The relation to this memory is a responsible one only if the contradictory injunctions are met in a way that amounts to a transformation of the tradition that is new each time, one that is singular. Needless to say, what we have seen in regard to the relation to the memory of Europe is valid as well for all other responsible decision making insofar as it takes place against the backdrop of an experience of tradition. Any responsible decision making must face the demand to give reasons without at the same time being reduced to knowledge that would merely be put into effect.<br>

Abstract: If, as Koselleck has envisaged, history was elevated as the subject of its own absolute self‐knowledge—history itself a unified history of humanity, imperially gathering up all special histories into the unifying realm of the collective singular—it was also empowered by what Ricoeur calls a “hidden form of the same claim” that could act against its untenable status as self‐knowledge and singular time (
         MHF,p. 305). The historical present, now established as the perspective for all temporal formations, is centered as an absolute. Once the collective singular is discredited in its impossible universalizing mission to singularize the history of humanity, it turns to the singular historical moment, which is the now of the historical present. Even today, it insists on the developmental imperative and its familiar claim of a totalizing history; the “vocables of world history” and the imposition of odious comparisons promote programs of catching up with the parade of the historical present attained by modern Euro‐America (MHF,p. 305). The here and now is henceforth distinguished from times past, to be sure, but also from those different temporalities that exist immanently in the modern present but are hidden from it, as in the there and the then, since it is our time that provides both perspective and tribunal. The here and now of actual experience, our modernity, is our history, our time, and never theirs. The distancing of expectation from past experiences thus becomes the condition of asserting the difference of our self‐valorizing and self‐referring modernity and its superiority over both its antecedents and others. But the decision to shift the concept of modernity to the register of an absolute historical present eventually required misrecognizing the apparent contradiction that our time and place is characterized by its unique difference from others. Moreover, the change of index directs attention instead to generalizing the values our modernity embodies an~<br>

Abstract: In contrast to the teleology and chronology of history, myth is a singular time‐space, a chronotope fusing present, past, and future. As Atlas recounts his story, he tells how he can “hear the world beginning. Time plays itself back for me. … I realise I am carrying not only this world, but all possible worlds. I am carrying the world in time as well as in space. … I am carrying its potential as well as what has so far been realised” (Winterson
         2005, 25). While the world embodies the myth as “a narrative whose beginning and ending continually inform the middle” (Coupe1997, 97), Atlas represents myth as eternal return and, with that, myth as tragic destiny (see Eliade1991, especially 34–46). Indeed, when Atlas, relieved from his burden by Heracles so that he can carry out one of the latter’s labors, comes to the Garden of the Hesperides to fetch the three golden apples, Hera tells him the rules of the mythical game. Reminding him that “Mother Earth’s greatest gift” is “knowledge of past and future,” she explains, “The apples you have taken are your own past and future. … The third apple is the present … made from your past, pointing toward the future. Which is it, Atlas? Only you can decide” (Winterson2005, 72–73). Hera speaks of choice; in contrast, Atlas speaks of fate: “There is no choice,” he says. “There is Fate. No man escapes his fate” (75). The goddess disagrees: “There was no enchantment, Atlas. You could not see the tree as it is. You could not see the changefulness of the world. All these pasts are yours, all these futures, all these presents. You could have chosen differently. You did not” (75).<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

New York: Cam- bridge University Press. 2003. Pp. xiii, 527. $60.00. In reviewing for this journal the first two volumes of J. G. A. Pocock's Barbarism and Religion, the present reviewer observed that there is a symphonic quality to Pocock's writing, as polyphonic lines in the form of concepts are spun out, developed, inverted, and brought into counterpoint with others. This third movement offers a scherzo reminiscent of the author's 1975 book, The Machiavellian Moment, and it sounds some of the same chords (republicanism, political cycles, civic virtue, arms vs. commerce). The subtitle of volume three is deceptively simple: it refers to the first (and best-known) volume of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece, which he published in 1776. That book commenced (after a very brief account of the structure of the Augustan principate) with the "Five Good" Antonine emperors from Nerva to Mar- cus Aurelius, and concluded (narratively) with Con- stantine's defeat of Licinius and restoration of a unified rule-a temporary resolution immediately fol- lowed by two chapters on Christianity that seem jarringly out of place, given the fact that Christians are scarcely mentioned through the previous fourteen chapters. Gibbon's readers had to wait until 1781 for the story to pick up again. Exposition of this "first decline and fall" in fact occupies only the ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END ~<br>

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives.

Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: Yet the nagging fact remains, lodged right at the generic crux of ethics and epistemology. For there is no denying that the withheld truth would have had a decisive ethical charge, removing the unearned guilt of years, releasing the unloved son to a different autobiographic consciousness altogether. The promissory morality of soul mates as helpmates in the novel's last paragraph—they are returned to a society that has previously contributed to their exclusion, to perform what service they now can—is of course stationed to outbid all epistemological regret. Yet to the supposed selflessness of this social ethic, the self-knowledge of the hero has been entirely sacrificed. What might have done him good is subsumed to his doing good. A logic like this does have its own communal morality, of course, but only if articulated. Instead, we get, unadmitted, a sublimation of the sexual into the social subject. In this way the closural immanence of form within the compromises of Dickens's story is neither providential nor evidentiary but merely and remorselessly conventional. I say merely, because conjugal love has been unfleshed into duty by an ideology of the so-called work ethic; remorselessly, because the pace of closure excludes all talking back from within the plot; but not seamlessly, because the false notes remain, jangling, reverberant. They remain, that is, for the reader to read—and this as a certain lingering discord that outlasts plot itself. In what we've stumbled over in the novel's final paragraph the discrepancy between knowledge and desire takes the form of a verbal deviance writ small, a mere glitch or two at the level of agreement, a predication no longer justified in the linguistic sense nor in the ethical and the epistemological senses, given that it implies a not only vaguely morbid but a downright deceptive variant of the marital two-made-one.

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Earlier I stated that just‐war morality involves a spiritual exercise—an ascesis—demanding political elites and ordinary citizens to discipline their attitudes, practices, and representations of the Other.
         75I also said that such an idea suggests a controversial point that harks back to an idea from Augustine, namely, that virtue is grounded in the practice of confession. We are now in a position to see how that is so. Confession for Augustine was not solely or chiefly a matter of privately disclosing personal temptation and wrongdoing, as is often thought. Such personal reports are part of a more general practice of rendering oneself accountable to standards that one does not wishfully create (or project), objective norms by which to measure one’s subjective leanings and desires. Confession, in short, is a matter of making oneself accountable to standards and purposes beyond one’s immediate interests. For Augustine and for those who follow in his path, self‐knowledge quickly slides into excessive self‐love and self‐deception without objective reference points by which to measure oneself. Self‐knowledge, including one’s personal and social memories, must be tested by the principle of reality. Virtue for Augustine thus relies on the willingness to submit oneself to norms by which to evaluate one’s loyalties and commitments. In our self‐reflexive acts, we must ask ourselves whether our self‐interpretation is grounded in reality or fabricated with an eye toward self‐justification.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

Abstract: Excavating Victoriansbrings out very clearly the discomfort the newly discovered vast expanse of geological time gave the Victorians and examines some of the writings that helped shape responses to it. Though the book may not be of particular relevance to the historian focusing closely on Victorian geology or archaeology, for the historian of science who examines wider cultural or literary phenomena it is an important guide to the stimulus that the writings of geologists and archaeologists gave other mid-Victorian writers. Nevertheless, the specialist or narrowly focused historian of science will probably find it frustrating rather than helpful, since the overviews of Victorian geology and archaeology are brief and there are distracting errors, such as the attribution of theNinth Bridgewater Treatiseto William Buckland rather than to Charles Babbage (p. 18). The chapters on Tennyson and Dickens are both interesting and illuminating, although a reader accustomed to historical argument and with limited knowledge of the techniques of literary criticism may find them faintly bewildering in places. Nonetheless, it is in this part of the analysis that the work provides valuable guidance to the historian of science.<br>

This absence is difficult to understand in a work of serious scholarship aimed at academic readers, as is the press's decision to invest in numerous glossy still‐frame illustrations that add nothing substantive to the analysis. However, the extensive, thematically organized filmographies and bibliographies that conclude the volume should prove very useful to all readers by providing a starting point for further reading and research.<br>

Abstract: But how shall all these shards of information be catalogued, organized, and merged into a larger enterprise? How shall information become knowledge and inquiry be disciplined? If the internet decenters research, the university remains staunchly hierarchical, committed at some level to selection, procedure, and evaluation. After all, its academic programs are built on what we call the course that from some motivated beginning promises to reach a plateau of understanding ten or fifteen weeks later. Student plans of study put courses in relation to one another, and we call the sum of courses, including their progression and interrelation, a curriculum. Of all American film scholars, Bordwell has been most dedicated to the film curriculum. His textbooks establish the bedrock information, concepts, and skills that enable more sophisticated inquiry into what he calls the historical poetics of the medium. He argues for and from first principles and believes students should progress to higher‐level courses (and presumably can succeed in them) only after having mastered foundational material (a modicum of film history) and skills (close analysis, archive research, and so on). But rare is the department in the U.S. that has implemented such a program, at least at the undergraduate level. Few film professors would refuse—for lack of prerequisites—smart, eager neophytes (English majors, say) who ask to join a senior seminar in feminist film theory or in the globalization of film distribution. Except in its production track, film studies does not take itself to be analogous to chemistry or economics in this regard. Still, at the minimum film studies programs should arrange things so that students can grow term by term in the depth, breadth, and subtlety of their film analyses and historical inquiries.<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur,  Paul<br>
Abstract: This is not Ricoeur at his most accessible, and I would not recommend the work as an entrance point for engaging his corpus. The essays are tough going, and the essays in the second section are particularly difficult. The essays do deal with important themes in Ricoeur’s work, ones especially visible in his later writings. Many of the essays are introduced with footnotes that indicate a debt to previous works, and nearly all the essays make some reference to the “little ethics” of
      Oneself as Anotherbut suggest that knowledge of these works is not necessary. This is not completely true in my estimation; it is difficult to discern where Ricoeur is headed in this volume if one knows little or nothing of where he has been. Some understanding may be gained without previous knowledge, but grounding in previous works is essential for a thorough understanding of this volume.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 10 2009<br>
Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: In making the language of prayer catachrestic, he is once more reinscribing a theme from the tradition, but more forcefully and centrally than his predecessors. Calvin had written, “God tolerates even our stammering and pardons our ignorance … as indeed without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray.”
         46Yet, classically, if there had been an epistemological problem in prayer, it was not about humanity’s knowledge of God (“the transcendency of religious Intuitions”) but rather about God’s knowledge of humanity: why pray, if God already knows what you are going to tell him? Equally, the focus on the Lord’s Prayer tended to mean that the language of prayer was a priori appropriate, even if Luther noted that its initial petitions were “Hebraically expressed,” that is, concerning spiritual mysteries.47However, catachresis is in keeping with the tenor of Coleridge’s thought: the “I” against itself, the limit of human reason against itself, unbelief against itself, language against itself.<br>

Author(s): Franke,  William<br>
Abstract: Revelation of the transcendent is always apocalyptic, but apocalypse is not limited to religious discourse: “For in poetry, language is broken open to let the previously inconceivable appear” (24). The negative capability of poetry is a creative deconstruction akin to negative theology, and this is especially true of modernist poetry that reflects on the limits of its own representation. The result is deconstructive—a breaking down of the idols of thought and speech—but also openness to what we cannot conceive or represent. The deconstructive power of literature reveals and reveils grace or gift, but Franke insists that this openness to transcendent mystery has no positive or dogmatic content. However, to deny this openness as irrational repeats the dogmatism of absolutist belief, and here Franke parts company with Habermas and insists that such openness informs reason. None of us has a privileged vantage point to confirm or deny the transcendent, and reason itself requires an openness that questions the present in pursuit of new knowledge.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 605587<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: The final chapters of
         The Enlightenment and the Intellectual Foundations of Modern Cultureexamine seventeenth- and eighteenth-century reactions to the sequestering of religion. Although Dupré does not cite any of the studies discussed in this essay, he nonetheless surveys much of their terrain. Like Bell, for instance, he observes that religion moved to the periphery in part owing to the rise of the nation-state during the eighteenth century. In addition, he notes along with Sheehan that biblical scholarship provided a means for reducing Scripture to the status of local history. It is on this point that Dupré returns to a major theme of his work, that rationalism succeeded more in casting doubt on traditional ways of formulating knowledge than in replacing them with a new content. One response to this failure was the emergence of a “spiritual counter-culture” during the period. Quietists and Pietists, Dupré contends, turned their backs on the question of self-assertion and instead advocated “a passive surrender to God's will.” However, their affirmation of the doctrinal independence of individual believers ultimately reinforced the Enlightenment's most characteristic tendency: the institution of the individual human person as the source of meaning (Dupré, 229–329, quotes on 318, 326).<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>
Date: 10 2010<br>
Author(s): Walter Gregory<br>
Abstract: All this could work in an adaptation of Tillich’s writing without addressing his intuitionism until we now take up the way to discern and think of the promise in specific gifts and promises. Because the promissory token is itself not a gift in the rudimentary sense but only the initial sign of what the donor promises, its being as possibility additionally enables discourse and debate about the promise. The doubled character of the promise or prophetic can also enable us to think about prophetic criticism as itself debatable. Its status as knowledge is not final and is revisable since the token is but a trace of the final promised gift. It invites trust but does not demand it. This means that any sign already is partaking of the ordinary economy of exchange of gifts.<br>

Author(s): Thistleton Anthony C.<br>
Abstract: The first two chapters of the book are introductory in nature. In the first chapter, Thistleton sets out to justify the enterprise of hermeneutics by delineating its aim and scope and by distinguishing it from the enterprise of philosophy in general. In the second chapter, he contextualizes and integrates contemporary hermeneutics, through the most recent insights and developments, within biblical studies and literary theory. He concludes this chapter by arguing that a proper understanding of hermeneutics requires a multi- and interdisciplinary approach; such an approach is the impetus for chapter 3, which employs the parables of Jesus as a case study in how a multi-perspectival approach casts different shades and light on a given text. With this more general understanding of hermeneutics in hand, it is to the history and development of hermeneutics that he next turns. In the remaining fourteen chapters, he outlines that history beginning with classical Jewish and ancient Greek thought, tracing it through developments in early, medieval, and modern Christianity and following it on up to contemporary continental philosophy. He concludes this narrative arc by looking at some current approaches to hermeneutics, notably liberation and postcolonialist, feminist and womanist, and postmodernist. Clearly, the scope of the work is vast and the breadth of Thistleton's knowledge is encyclopedic, for it not only spans the history of hermeneutics as such but also engages interdisciplinary approaches in contemporary hermeneutics.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 659348<br>
Date: 4 2011<br>
Author(s): Landy Joshua<br>
Abstract: My approach has something in common with that of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht's
            Production of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey(Stanford, Calif., 2004). I differ, however, in viewing the crucial contemporary barrier to contemplation as that of an obsession with narrative rather than an obsession with meaning. (The last thing I would accuse contemporary culture of is a surfeit of intellectualism!) To be reengaged with nonnarrative phenomena does not require us to surrender all interest in meanings; perceiving the beauty of a gesture, for example, requires understanding what it signifies. Nor does it require us to surrender all interest in depth, another of Gumbrecht's targets; on the contrary, the beauty of other human beingsistheir depth, the depth of that invisible perspective which emerges in their aesthetic and everyday style. Even scientific knowledge—such as the delightful fact, inAdaptation, about Darwin's moth—can be truly enchanting, an enrichment rather than a desiccation of experience. We may well wish to save all these charming babies from going out with the “meaning” bathwater. What is more, the contemplation of orchids need, on my account, have nothing mystical about it (it would certainly not need to involve a perception of “Being”) and need not be transitory in the manner of epiphanies (orchid-lovers can happily stare at bromeliads all day). Finally, I hope to have given a substantive account of the role that the non-“presence” elements play in the fictional work; as I see it, these elements are absolutely necessary for making the flowers available in the first place.<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Date: 01 01, 2012<br>
Author(s): Bowman Sharon<br>
Abstract: In sum, this is one of the most important books on selves or the practical side of personhood in the last decade. It is also well written; the particular arguments are virtually always clear, and it is not too hard to keep track of their role within in the larger argument of the book. Some portions rise to an almost literary style and provide a rich survey of key ideas in twentieth-century French philosophy, while others engage quite originally with scholarship in moral psychology and theories of self-knowledge that will be more familiar to analytic readers. This work also complements the more detailed ethical theory on Larmore’s other books. Despite its relative inattention to volitional aspects of practical identity, and some questionable moves in the critique of authenticity, then, this work is still highly recommended.<br>

Author(s): Walton Heather,<br>
Abstract: This tensional approach enables new possibilities for the field. As David Jasper recognizes, literature is no longer (to quote John Wesley) the “handmaid of piety” (5). Accordingly, the field is not limited to art and literature that are explicitly theological or religious, nor is it limited to literature and theology within the Christian traditions. Literature can now both instruct and deconstruct theology. For Jasper, theology is no longer tenable without literature. Invoking Emmanuel Lévinas as well as Ricoeur, Hass helps us to understand why: theology needs the apophatic power of metaphor to redescribe reality and to confront the other that cannot be reduced to any single discipline. Alana Vincent reminds us that this is not easy, nor is this work ever done, but this is what makes the work so valuable. Interdisciplinary inquiry confronts us with insurmountable uncertainties and ambiguities, but these challenges are constructive opportunities to reflect upon the limits of our knowledge, our boundaries, and our disciplines.<br>

Author(s): Csordas Thomas<br>
Abstract: Among the multiple dimensions of social and cultural imagination, morality occupies a blurred place across social domains, being Religion, on the one hand, and Law, on the other, the traditional loci of the moral in classical anthropology. Tom Csordas’s article helps us think beyond tradition, pointing out a little addressed topic in the emerging subfield of the anthropology of morality: the notion of
         evil, which, by the way, was and still is of central concern in shamanic and witchcraft studies, and also in certain currents of contemporary philosophy. This article interrogates us about the possibility of defining morality “as a cultural system,” in Clifford Geertz’s sense. In doing so, the author seems to discard finally the idea of morality as a “cultural system” for a less systematic, dispersed set of moral meanings that traverse social life. In this undertaking he does not leave the central Geertzian concern on symbols and meaning. Ultimately, human action is mediated by symbols that condense and produce meaning. Here, meaning seems to be the master concept related to the anthropological study of morality. Among the cultural meanings that shape moralities, Csordas finds appropriate introducing cross-cultural notions of evil to enrich any anthropological approach to morality. In the multifarious realms of morality, evil appears as a complex idiom or code through which moral notions are expressed. And among cultural practices, witchcraft and sorcery are of central concern to understand how many societies build their moral frameworks. Regarded both as a human and a cosmological (or nonhuman) phenomenon, evil in Csordas’s view as a cross-cultural analytical category, might enlighten studies about what I may call the “moral installation in the world.” The latter is related with the existential approach to morality proposed in this article. But I consider that, in conceptual terms, morality is always hierarchically included in ontology (what is the nature of ~<br>

Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>

Author(s): Urbaniak Jakub<br>
Abstract: Few have experienced the consequences of religion being used by the political order as a tool to mobilize forces for its agendas more acutely than Bonhoeffer. Bethge, his closest friend to whom most prison letters were addressed, asks rhetorically, “Is there not concealed behind our religious trends our ungovernable urge toward … power—in the name of God to do what
         wewant, and in the name of the Christian worldview to stir up and play people against one another?”
               Those immersed in the forms of religion that legitimate their own culture are particularly susceptible to ignorance regarding the deep connection between religion and the will to power. Unlike religious institutions (in the Bonhoefferian sense), the church that is rooted in Jesus’s being for others has the potential to offer the world a vision that relativizes all social orders.155
            
               Commenting on Matt. 7:21, where Jesus says, “Not all who say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven,” Bonhoeffer warns against “a kind of confession of Christ that Jesus rejects because it is in contradiction with doing the will of God.”156
            
               Jesus rejects such a confession, Bonhoeffer, explains, “because it arises out of our own human knowledge of good and evil.”157
            
               Therefore, the ecclesia must always remain aware of the danger consisting in a religious dogmatism that equips the believer with the categories of good and evil without incorporating personal relation with God as the measure against which his or her life is to be discerned.158

Abstract: Bosola’s figure is only one of the play’s many attempts to make sense out of seemingly senseless cruelty. The same world of suffering that leads to his image of the stars’ tennis match inspires a very different response from Antonio. In conversation with the Duchess, Antonio delivers one of the most notable of the play’s many “wise” statements: “Man (like to
      Cassia) is prov’d best, being bruiz’d” (3.5.71). In a precursor to Bradley’s meditations on the fragrance of a crushed flower, Antonio also responds to tragic events with an argument that our best selves are revealed through suffering, making pain a valuable experience and tragedy a process of identity formation. Antonio’s perspective, like Bradley’s, grows out of confrontation with a tragic world that appears destined to crush its inhabitants and through associations that find value in that process. But just as the play casts doubt on the ability of the senses to perceive reality, it also questions the capacity of metaphor to make sense of suffering. Webster’s strongest character, the Duchess, rejects Antonio’s philosophy—although even she cannot escape the metaphorical thinking ingrained in the world of the play. In response to Antonio, she produces two images of her own:
            Though she initially rejects Antonio’s philosophy outright, the Duchess reveals her own uncertainty about the nature and meaning of her suffering by introducing a second figurative interpretation. Her images inject the play with what could be seen as an optimistic view of divine involvement in human life, and she asserts her own ability to make “sense” of her pain through concepts developed out of her personal experience, not generalized

Abstract: In an effort to overcome David Hume's skepticism, Immanuel Kant attempted, among other things, to establish both the validity of knowledge and the impossibility of knowledge without sensory experience. The idea of times derives from the succession of our perceptions. For, as it is from the disposition of visible and tangible objects that we receive the ideas of space, it is also from the succession of ideas and impressions that we form the idea of time. Time, then for Kant, becomes a “necessary” representation that underlies all “time,” he remarks, “is therefore a purely subjective condition of our (human) intuition [ … ] and in itself, apart from the subject, is nothing” (p. 166). G. F. W. Hegel proceeded beyond Kant to posit that “the narration of history and historical deeds and events appear at the same time; a common inner principle brings them forth together.” In discussing Paul Ricoeur's approach to the question of time, formulated in
      Time and Narrative, Mooij traces the philosophic traditions of idealism, phenomenology, and hermeneutics in that three‐volume work. For Ricoeur, “time requires narratives in order to manifest itself fully” (p. 240).<br>

Abstract: This debate eventually focused on the nature of revelation (letters 35–39), with Strauss having written that “there is an essential distinction between the thinking of the Middle ages, based on revelation, and the thinking of classical antiquity, not based on revelation” (78). Voegelin responded that both revelation and reason are part of a universal human knowledge that is understood concretely and experientially. This prompted Strauss to write back that claims of a universal human knowledge must reside in the realm of philosophy and not in Christianity. To understand Plato properly, one should not impose “biblical concepts,” since they are separate from Greek philosophy. Although Strauss and Voegelin did not resolve this debate, it does clarify and present challenges to both thinkers' philosophies: for Voegelin, the claim that the experience of the divine is the foundation of a universal, human knowledge requires some sort of demonstration in order for him to escape what Strauss referred to as “the desert of Kierkegaard's subjectivism” (88); for Strauss, the tension between reason and revelation suggests a permanent condition of human incompleteness that is unable to point to a right way of life, leading one into nihilism.<br>

Abstract: Among other interpretations one should also think of this rhetoric as a means to justify the subdivision of power within architectural offices. Sociologist Judith Blau stated, in her
               Architects and Firms: A Sociological Perspective on Architectural Practice(Cambridge and London: MIT Press, 1987), 26, that in architecture similar training and shared knowledge create a bond between different echelons within the firm. Blau and Cuff (Architecture,130–37), demonstrate that this bond brings the sense of purpose to entry-level architects' every day activities—but it could also lead to subtle forms of exploitation. Clearly, the presentation of the production of working drawings as pleasurable and enjoyable was directed toward aspiring architects and the lower echelons of architects' offices, to encourage an understanding of the material qualities of a project, and this rewarding and pleasurable aspect of being an architect. See Woods,From Craft to Profession, 141–46, for her depiction of the complex mixture of camaraderie and exploitation that took place in architectural offices at the turn of the century.<br>

Author(s): Thomas Paul Brian<br>
Abstract: By utilizing the textual products of extraterrestrial-inspired religious thinkers like George Van Tassel, Raël, and Patricia Cori, as well as related materials by Erich von Däniken and Zecharia Sitchin, this article explores the concept of revisionism in ET-inspired religions. The authors examined in this article reread ancient religious texts, especially the Bible, as containing evidence of extraterrestrial influence in the course of human history. The anatomy of this "drive to revise" human history is explored, including an examination of how an improvisational millenarianism combines with a cultic milieu suspicious of authority and hegemonic narratives, and the conspiratorial intellectual maverick willing to work with "stigmatized" knowledge to produce narratives that are highly critical and suspicious of established intellectual authorities and procedures.<br>

Abstract: Using data from an ethnographic study of
         tarot divination, occult claims to knowledge are analyzed and interpreted. Attention is focused on theproceduresparties to occult divination employ to claim and sustain what they regard as extraordinary knowledge. This view of occult knowledge stands opposed to efforts to discredit occult claims as unscientific or the result of psychosocial conditions like deprivation and marginality. Like knowledge in general, occult knowledge is a product of sociohistorical influences, interactional negotiation, and interpretation. The challenge for sociology therefore is the pursuit of the social interactional and historical processes whereby knowledge and interpretation are accomplished in everyday life.<br>

Article Title: Ways of Evaluating Teacher Cognition: Inferences concerning the Goldilocks Principle<br>
Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>
Issue: i249721<br>
Date: 10 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Zumwalt Dona M.<br>
Abstract: Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be "too big" (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process--product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes.<br>

Abstract: The study of teachers' personal practical knowledge is an emerging orientation that focuses on the way teachers' understanding of their world affects the way they structure classroom experience and interact with students, parents, colleagues, and administrators. I argue that several recent articles on this topic are developing greatly enriched models of cognition, meaning, understanding, and knowledge. These models emphasize nonpropositional, pre-reflective dimensions of meaning that arise in our spatio-temporal orientations, perceptual interactions, and bodily movements. To take these experiential dimensions seriously requires new models of cognition and thus marks out a new territory for curriculum inquiry.<br>

Abstract: An assumed link between language and experience prompted the narrative collection and mutual interpretation of data between me and an immigrant from Iran whom I taught ESL. An underlying theme of the study was the quest for a helpful image of language. Realizing that dictionary meanings were inadequate in the meaning-making process, we concentrated on illustrative examples for the meaning of words. We exploited mininarratives implicit in such examples-incipient stories based on the speaker's past, present, and imaginatively projected experiences. As we expanded these "experiential narratives," the student's personal practical knowledge emerged and helped clarify troublesome words and sentences. Viewing language as experiential narrative demonstrated the importance of the context of acquisition. It increased opportunities for the negotiation of meaning and highlighted the notion of agency in the constitution of meanings.<br>

Issue: i250466<br>
Date: 4 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): White Marcy Singer<br>
Abstract: This article examines challenges to discourses of curriculum research and practice by the growing fascination with alternative forms of representation. The author takes as a starting point a cluster of exchanges with students that were situated in a study of a classroom in which music and image joined word and number as essential sources for learning about a context irreducibly distant from students' own: the past. In the study, what seemed to make painting, photography, film, and poetry potent sources of understanding was their capacity to bridge the gap between a remote, textbook past, and the sensory world of the students' present; these forms expressed to students not only the outline of events, but also what the events signified and felt like. Yet, in juxtaposing students' comments against discourses of historiography, philosophical aesthetics, and history teaching and learning, one soon recognizes that the very ability of the arts to communicate a sense of immediacy and human intention is what makes them problematic as sources of historical insight: in pushing out the boundaries of "acceptable" forms beyond discursive text, one also pushes up against assumptions about the nature and purposes of knowledge and inquiry. While the starting point of this article is historical inquiry, the author argues that the difficulties of representing experiences of persons in contexts removed in time or space, and of making sense of others' representations, are relevant to other forms of inquiry; the challenge of the arts to historical inquiry is paralleled in other fields, and no less in educational research.<br>

world-is founded on an illusion, that rather than provide "a discourse of self-
restoration," autobiography knows only the "language of privation" (923)<br>

Article Title: Study Drawings in Architectural Design: Their Properties as a Graphic Medium<br>
Publisher: Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, Inc.<br>
Issue: i262141<br>
Date: 1 1, 1978<br>
Author(s): Tyler Daniel M.<br>
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical foundation for extending our understanding of study drawings by bringing forward concepts from a number of disciplines that are concerned with the structure of knowledge. Study drawings are defined as the informal, private drawings that architectural designers use as a medium for graphic thinking in the exploratory stages of their work. Drawings from the work of Paxton through Picasso are analyzed to confirm the familiar characteristics of study drawings and to identify the properties which account for their role in the working process of design, including their use as a means of inquiry. This epistemological function is compared with certain features of written language in order to propose an internal structure for study drawings. The paper concludes that much of the origin and nature of knowledge in design can be explained in terms of the properties and processes of study drawings and that these terms should be used to evaluate proposals for new media in design.<br>

Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann<br>
Issue: i262155<br>
Date: 8 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Kramer Réjean<br>
Abstract: As a basis for the professionalization of their field, architectural historians have assumed the autonomy and verifiability of historical knowledge. Central to these premises is the view that the archives and monuments of the past are the primary sources of the discipline. The historian's task is conceived as the gathering, selection, and verification of facts, the interpretation of which is presented in "literary" form for the sake of communicability. As such, a separation of form from content is assumed. However, recent studies in historiography insist on the determinant role played by the language of the historian upon the representation of history. In these works, critical insights developed in the fields of linguistics, rhetoric, and literary theory are brought to bear upon the analysis of historical accounts, pointing to the other "source" of history: discourse and rhetoric. This article reassesses the link among history, literature, and language. It raises the issue of the nature and authority of historical narratives and encourages rethinking their role within the discipline of architecture.<br>

Article Title: Toward an Ontology of Relativism<br>
Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263711<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Wilson Mark C.<br>
Abstract: Despite the significant impact of the awareness of perspectival relativism on the religious imagination, recent philosophers and theologians have rarely subjected epistemological relativism to careful scrutiny. This paper attempts to overcome the current theological impasse by a careful exploration of the metaphysical implications of relativism. The central thesis of the essay is that truth is relative because meaning is contextual and being is relational. Contextualized meaning and relational being join to form relative truth disclosed through symbolic awareness. The roots of contemporary relativism lie deep within eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophical movements and are inseparably entangled with the psycho-social pluralization endemic to the process of modernization. The efforts of Neo-orthodoxy, polytheism, and the scientific study of religion to resolve dilemmas posed by epistemological relativism are inadequate. What has gone unnoticed is that the discovery of truth's relativity is the realization of its inherently dialectical character. This insight begins to emerge when it is recognized that meaning is contextual and context is semiophantic. Principles identified in Hegel's logic, in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of temporality, and in Ricoeur's and Gadamer's hermeneutics disclose that meaning assumes form through dialectical interrelationship in which co-implicates mutually constitute each other. The synchronic and diachronic dimensions of relationality reveal the inexhaustability and perpetual revisability of meaning. The problem of semantics, however, is inseparable from the question of ontology. Ontological reflection leads to the conclusion that being itself is dialectical-fundamentally social or essentially relational. Determinate identity is born of ontological intercourse with otherness. Relations are not external and accidental, but are internal and essential to being itself. Identity and difference, unity and plurality, oneness and manynes~<br>

Publisher: American Academy of Religion<br>
Issue: i263719<br>
Date: 3 1, 1974<br>
Author(s): Weiss Richard<br>
Abstract: Anyone who wishes to understand the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is forced to confront not only the staggering complexity of their thought but also the disparate nature of the key texts which are available and the fact that many philosophers and theologians approach Hegel and Schleiermacher with misleading preconceptions. This article attempts to illuminate the conflict between the two thinkers by exploring the biographical and historical context in which it arose. The author argues that, while neither thinker depended upon the other in forming his own position, each man kept the other's position constantly in view as a foil for his own. After a consideration of some early indications of conflict, the debate between Hegel and Schleiermacher is traced through a series of events which begins with Hegel's call to Berlin. While Schleiermacher was apparently quite willing to have Hegel come to Berlin, differences in political philosophy soon led to conflict, with the student movement providing a concrete focus for their disagreement. Schleiermacher's role in excluding Hegel from the Berlin Academy of Sciences is shown to have heightened the tensions. The article concludes with an exploration of Hegel's critique of Schleiermacher's dogmatics. It is argued that the intellectual core of the conflict between the two men centers upon the problem of immediate knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Anthropologists have seldom avoided anecdotal data and included in their texts information about how they produce knowledge that they claim to be true. While considering fieldwork as the foundation of their discipline as well as their identity, they have removed this activity from analysis and overlooked its relationship with textualisation. This account of fieldwork in Quilombo Frechal (Maranhao, Brazil) purports to move from "participant observation to observation of participation" (Tedlock 1991), including in written texts the process of construction of anthropological knowledge. It attempts to represent the social reality of "Others" through an analysis of one's own experience in their world.<br>

Abstract: Creativity is seen as inherent in the developmental potential of the individual and of society as well. This "yen for becoming" is felt at all ages, and is in fact recognized as associated with the realization of the profoundest aspirations of man. Its origin is detected in early childhood. It is deeply rooted in the associative trend of thought and action, a trend which tends to perpetuate itself in the direction of unending abundance and novelty. The process assumes passage from awareness to memory, and even to the subconscious. The thought of the moment dips into the past, awakens memories, even those seemingly forgotten, reactivates all that is pertinent for the creation of new structures. It is believed that this tendency is essentially dynamic, endowed with energy which drives toward endless realizations. Nothing dies in the subconscious, as Freud pointed out. Each past experience is apt to return into consciousness and engage in a double process of homogenization and heterogenization, of convergent and divergent currents. Here the combinations, or commutations and permutations, are indefinite, an array which defies any computer. Creativity calls into play all energized experiences, present and stored, cognitive and affective, perceptual and conceptual, sensory and motoric, verbal and non-verbal, taxonomic and functional, real and symbolic; it constantly provokes new patterns. The richer the content of experience, the greater the possibility of innovation. The creative construction starts with the activation of readily available knowledge, the elements of which trigger related material in the memory and the subconscious. The movement is derived from active associations that continue to connect the units, and is oriented toward specific goals, leading to eventual syntheses, which may be expressed in either action or discourse. Here we face an unfurling, which coincides with interpretation, the unlocking of the new meaning built from the past upon the first mean~<br>

Abstract: Anecdotal evidence suggests that many qualitative researchers have had the experience of discovering that their informants had told them lies. This is quite different to those instances where faulty memory, subjective perception, partial or erroneous knowledge, a desire to give the researcher what they think they want, or even where a 'personal myth' comes in to play, because a lie is a conscious and deliberate intention to deceive. What should researchers do when they discover that they have been misled? What are the implications for qualitative methodology and its practitioners in the light of the criteria for good practice outlined in the Tooley Report? This article draws on two examples of informants who lied, in order to explore some of the questions and issues that can arise. It suggests, tentatively, that generic criteria may not always be sufficiently sensitive to cope with complexities of social life.<br>

Author(s): Balthasar Kenneth<br>
Abstract: Hans Urs von Balthasar says: "The key to the understanding of God's action lies
exclusively in the interpretation which God gives of himself before man on the stage of
human nature .... What God has done for man is 'understandable' only in so far as it is
not understandable or justifiable from a human, worldly point of view, and from the
standpoint of our fragmentary knowledge: by these standards it is bound to appear 'fool-
ishness' and 'madness'" (Love Alone: The Way of Revelation [London: Burns & Oates,
19681 58).

Abstract: Analysis of records of women at risk for abuse showed that though information about abuse was present, emergency room physicians rarely utilized it. The doctor-patient interaction tended to obscure rather than elucidate knowledge of abuse. Medicine's epistemologic model of care reconstructs abusive relationships through a medical encounter in which what is most significant is not seen. Nurses are less affected by the model but are under institutional constraints that lead to similar outcomes.<br>

Publisher: The American Political Science Association<br>
Issue: i333635<br>
Date: 3 1, 1962<br>
Author(s): Wheelwright Eugene F.<br>
Abstract: Since the language of political inquiry seems to be inescapably metaphorical, the question necessarily arises as to how metaphors of various types, including models, enter into the composition and expression of political knowledge. The solutions that have been most influential in contemporary political science can be called the verificationist and constitutivist views of political metaphor. While both views contain important elements of truth, there are fundamental difficulties in each that require the search for a more satisfactory view. An alternative view of metaphor and political knowledge is developed by reference to four main problems: Why is political speech metaphorical? How do metaphors make political things manifest? How are political metaphors tested? and Are metaphors indispensable to political expression and political knowledge?<br>

Article Title: The Formation of Soviet Foreign Policy: Organizational and Cognitive Perspectives<br>
Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
Issue: i308720<br>
Date: 4 1, 1982<br>
Author(s): Jonsson Christer<br>
Abstract: Several recent studies of Soviet foreign policy formation have sought to bring organizational and cognitive considerations to bear on the subject. The article evaluates these perspectives and suggests how future research may, through the use of cognitive methods of analysis, distinguish formally between different conceptualizations of Soviet foreign policy formation, thus permitting a more rigorous empirical examination of the organizational issues involved. A model of inference that accounts for organizational and cognitive links between the Soviet press and Soviet foreign policy formation is also constructed; examples are drawn from the items under review. In conclusion, the article outlines a research strategy for cumulating knowledge about how the Soviet system works, and specifies what the organizational and cognitive frameworks for the study of Soviet foreign policy formation may contribute to such a project.<br>

Abstract: One of the most prominent features of the Irish landscape is the great multitude of megalithic sites which date back to the Neolithic. In this paper, I will attempt to demonstrate that the understanding of these sites in Ireland can be enhanced by referencing the native tradition, including the Irish word for the sites, sí, and the sí's powerful cultural tradition attested to throughout native Irish folklore, literature, onomastics, and traditional knowledge. In doing so, I will explore the difficulties and the potentials of interdisciplinary communication between archaeology and folkloristics, and the related issues regarding communication between official and unofficial discourses.<br>

Issue: i20184615<br>
Date: 11 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Iguchi Kawori<br>
Abstract: This article seeks to explore the act of reading as an essential element of notated musical practices and of the construction of knowledge about them. By examining how musical notations affect their reader-performers (and vice versa) in two different musical contexts in Japan--the Kyoto Gion festival and amateur lessons on the nohkan flute--the article draws attention to the ways in which the act of reading notation is central to the construction of knowledge about such musical practices. With reference to Etienne Wenger's notion of learning as a process of alignment, and to debates in the anthropology of reading, it then argues that, for learners of these musics, reading notations is a practice of reverse tracing towards the bodily practices of the accomplished. In discussing the musicians' concern for the efficacy of reading as a means of achieving a relevant state of understanding, the article also addresses questions on the role of reading as a method of becoming knowledgeable in the practice of anthropological inquiry.<br>

Article Title: A Socio-Cultural Theorisation of Formative Assessment<br>
Publisher: Routledge Journals, Taylor & Francis<br>
Issue: i20462366<br>
Date: 2 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Crossouard Barbara<br>
Abstract: Formative assessment has attracted increasing attention from both practitioners and scholars over the last decade. This paper draws on the authors' empirical research conducted over eleven years in educational situations ranging from infant schools to postgraduate education to propose a theorisation of formative assessment. Formative assessment is seen as taking place when teachers and learners seek to respond to student work, making judgements about what is good learning with a view to improving that learning. However, the theorisation emphasises formative assessment as being a discursive social practice, involving dialectical, sometimes conflictual, processes. These bring into play issues of power in which learners' and teachers' identities are implicated and what counts as legitimate knowledge is framed by institutional discourses and summative assessment demands. The paper argues that, rather than only paying attention to the content of learning, an ambition for formative assessment might be to deconstruct these contextual issues, allowing a critical consideration of learning as a wider process of becoming. The article suggests a model that might be useful to teachers and learners in achieving this.<br>

Abstract: In this article, the author argues that many of the best practices of oral history reflect phenomenological thinking even though practitioners may not describe themselves as using phenomenological methods. The author suggests that knowledge and application of phenomenology can clarify or minimize such potential problems as interviewer bias and informant unreliability and can refute accusations that oral history is less reliable than history taken from documents.<br>

Abstract: "Cross-Cultural Research Methods" pretends to be a primer on the "how to" of conducting cross-cultural research, but focuses only on quantitative methods that use secondary data in the service of generating knowledge. The book is caught twice in the dialectic of the general and the specific, by putting all its eggs into the former basket and failing to recognize the role of the latter both in research itself and in the teaching of research methods to its readers. Because I know that the students in my graduate research methods course would fail to appreciate the book, I would neither select nor recommend it to others as a resource in teaching (quantitative) research methods or research designs courses.<br>

Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The contribution outlines a research programme which I have coined the "sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse). This approach to discourse integrates important insights of FOUCAULT's theory of discourse into the interpretative paradigm in the social sciences, especially the "German" approach of hermeneutic sociology of knowledge (Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie). Accordingly, in this approach discourses are considered as "structured and structuring structures" which shape social practices of enunciation. Unlike some Foucauldian approaches, this form of discourse analysis recognises the importance of socially constituted actors in the social production and circulation of knowledge. Furthermore, it combines research questions related to the concept of "discourse" with the methodical toolbox of qualitative social research. Going beyond questions of language in use, "the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse" (Wissenssoziologische Diskursanalyse) addresses sociological interests, the analyses of social relations and politics of knowledge as well as the discursive construction of reality as an empirical ("material") process. For empirical research on discourse the approach proposes the use of analytical concepts from the sociology of knowledge tradition, such as interpretative schemes or frames (Deutungsmuster), "classifications", "phenomenal structure" (Phänomenstruktur), "narrative structure", "dispositif" etc., and the use of the methodological strategies of "grounded theory".<br>

Abstract: Actual efforts to use Michel FOUCAULT's ideas about discourse for empirical research induce a linguistic bias which misses FOUCAULT's interests in power/knowledge. Against such tendencies, this article argues for a grounding of discourse theory and empirical discourse research in the sociology of knowledge, especially in the German-based Hermeneutische Wissenssoziologie, which follows the BERGER/LUCKMANN approach to knowledge. For the purposes of empirical discourse research on knowledge, the author first considers the interpretative dimension of research. Then, some conceptual tools for knowledge analysis are presented (interpretative scheme, classification, phenomenal structure, narrative structure). Third, drawing on grounded theory and sequential analysis, concrete work on texts is discussed. Finally, the article insists that discourse research should not be reduced to the analysis of spoken or written texts. Instead, different kinds of materiality—for example as dispositifs—have to be considered.<br>

Abstract: In sociohistorical inquiry, no epistemology prevails as a widely accepted account of knowledge. Positivism yet retains its defenders. As alternatives, both structuralist and hermeneutic challenges to science are undermined as foundations of knowledge by their own accounts, yielding the postmodern loss of certitude. Conventionalism, rationalism, and realism have been proposed as "local epistemologies" under the new conditions, and on a broader level, pragmatic and transcendental theories of communication substitute for epistemology classically conceived. As yet, these contending developments do not resolve the crisis of sociohistorical knowledge.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>
Issue: i20849827<br>

Author(s): Cormier Philippe<br>
Abstract: Le dépassement phénoménologique du substantialisme métaphysique devrait permettre aujourd'hui d'envisager une refondation de la notion de personne, laquelle s'était quelque peu immobilisée depuis Boèce. Sur ce nouvel horizon, le retour à la fondation première, celle d'Augustin, s'impose. Celui-ci est le premier en effet, pour l'essentiel dans son traité de la Trinité, à avoir clairement pensé la personne (divine) comme relation et non comme substance. La réduction augustinienne de la personne (humaine) à l'ego ou à « l'homme intérieur » ouvre la possibilité d' « analogies subjectives » avec la Trinité: pensée, amour, connaissance; mémoire, intelligence, volonté. Cependant, la spéculation augustinienne trouve sa limite en échouant à penser une personne de chair — et, qui plus est, une telle personne comme « en relation ». Ce qui était relation en Dieu reste, en l'homme, substance pensante, seule face à son Dieu. Phenomenology has overcome the old substance of metaphysics and then should permit us today to refound the idea of the person which was in a way, since Boethius, brought to a standstill. Therefore we must to go back to St. Augustine who was actually the first, in his De Trinitate, to conceive, the (divine) person as a relation and not as a substance. The (human) person so confined to the ego or to the « inner man » allows some possible « subjective analogies » with the Trinity: thought, love, knowledge, memory, intelligence and will. However the Augustinian theory fails to conceive first the person in her own flesh and blood — a bodily person — and secondly such a person as being « in relation »: man is a thinking substance, alone facing her God.<br>

Abstract: In many parts of the world, excavations of British military sites have unearthed material reflecting lifeways in the British Empire. Specifically, studies of historical ceramics and glass have greatly advanced our understanding of status and material expression. This study highlights the current body of knowledge on British military crested ceramics, contrasting the rarity of archaeological finds with their abundance in documentary sources. An elemental stylistic analysis reveals that these crests expressed regimental affiliation as the fundamental unit of self-identification. Symbolic interpretation of these crests stresses their active role in the socialization of officers and structuring collective memory, particularly through the mess institution.<br>

Abstract: Josef Macek has provided a capsule summary of historical
semantics: "The historian does not interest himself only with the relation between the
sign and the concept, or merely between the word and the psychological endowment
of man; he inquires about the relation existing between the sense of a word and the
world itself- that is, the external facts and states of affairs. The word does not reflect
things and the universe only in a passive manner but constitutes an active element in
the reflection upon these things, as in the process of knowledge itself" ("Pour une
semantique historique," in Melanges en honneur de F. Braudel [Toulouse, 1973],
p. 344).

Abstract: The first part of the article discusses the usefulness of the biographical method in order to solve some epistemological crucial issues: the integration between comprehension and explanation, the possibility of an objective (or at least intersubjective) knowledge, the overcoming of the micro-macro dicothomy. The second part holds the utility of such a method in order to study the reflexive post-modern society and especially the contribution intellectuals can offer to the post-modern culture. Results from recent empirical research are discussed. The last part-though recognizing some methodological problems linked with life stories — stresses flexibility and openess as the main virtues of this method.<br>

Abstract: The article examines one of the problems opened by the specific diachronic perspective of the biographic field, i.e. the set of the theoretical and methodological approaches that use biographic material. The forms of memory implied in the narrative of the life story are analysed, along with two of the main pre-methodological conceptions that deal with the problem of the knowledge that is reachable by using biographic methods.<br>

Abstract: The Phenomenology says that every knowledge is a perspective knowledge, because every knowledge is situated in a time and in a space. The human's embodiment discloses a perspective overview on the world. The paper claims the aim to analyze how the sexual and gender dimensions, which are incarnated in a determinate body, are present in the qualitative research, specifically into the ethnographic observation. First for all, we hypothesize that the gender is a border for the access into a field and not in other, so to be man or woman is not neutral for the knowledge of a specific social context. Moreover, the performative dimension of the gender, which shows the norms that pre-exist and that conduct the role's interaction (i.e. the role's gendered content and the role's gendered language) is another tie in the participant observation. The awareness that all the knowledge is gendered, requires to the fieldworker to play a double competence (ability). The researcher must use the self reflexivity to point out his gender identity and his background on this theme: he must point out his background frame relatively to the gender, his gender behaviour's expectations in the interaction, and his correlated opinions. The researcher, moreover, must know that exist a cultural mainstream about the gender, but that the concrete gender playing is based on the interaction in a concrete frame. So, we have a lot of concrete ways in which the gender is embodied. The researcher on the field, so, must enter in a knowledge's circulation in which must point attention to: the epistemic interdependence, i.e. the knowledge borns in the symbolic interaction between the researcher and the subject; the gendered nature of the communicative interaction between the researcher and the subject; the negotiable nature of the concrete managing of the gendered role in the interaction.<br>

Abstract: The long-standing dominance of history in the adjudication of debates on postcolonialism and modernity in India has resulted in the relegation of the knowledge claims of `classical' performance traditions and aesthetic concepts to the domain of the essentializing and the untrustworthy. This paper argues that performances of music and dance have preserved an understanding of tradition that is more dynamic and agential than that put forward by nationalist understandings of tradition, and that aesthetic conceptions continue to illuminate the values and efficacy of these practices in engaging the affects of spectators. The paper explores in particular the subject position of the rasika as offering a distinctive way of inhabiting the present. The class privilege implicit in being able to take up such an invitation is explored in the second part of the paper. La longue domination de l'histoire dans l'orientation des débats sur le post-colonialisme et la modernité en Inde a relégué les prétentions au statut de savoir des arts performatifs et des concepts esthétiques « classiques » au domaine des choses essentialisantes et peu fiables. Le présent article fait valoir que les performances de musique et de danse ont préservé une compréhension de la tradition plus dynamique et agentielle que celle mise en avant dans les interprétations nationalistes, et que les conceptions esthétiques continuent de mettre en lumière les valeurs et l'efficacité de ces pratiques en faisant appel aux affects des spectateurs. L'article explore en particulier la position de sujet du rasika comme une manière différente d'habiter le présent. Le privilège de classe, implicite dans la possibilité d'accepter une telle invitation, est exploré dans la deuxième partie de l'article.<br>

Abstract: What role do emotions play in the way in which young people confront the history of the Holocaust? This article examines memorial sites and video interviews of survivors as interfaces of the representation and appropriation of the past. These contact zones satisfy the need for emotional participation and for information. Videos uploaded by youngsters on the internet following their visit to memorial sites, and short films extracted by pupils from survivor's video interviews, were used as examples in order to examine emotional strategies. These products of involvement point to stored images and ideas mediated by mass media. This repertoire of cultural knowledge and feelings can serve as a template for understanding how young people process the Holocaust emotionally.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo es un intento de aproximación a las singularidades de Pablo Neruda como lector, sobre la base de su doble condición de lector que hace un uso libre e intencionado de los textos, y de lector antilibresco. Examina dos vertientes de lecturas de Neruda, aquellas vinculadas con la tradición literaria —a las que el poeta denomina "el bosque de la literatura"—, y las otras, extra literarias, relacionadas con diversas disciplinas y con la historia del conocimiento. El artículo se ocupa también de la transición entre la lectura textual y la lectura del mundo en Neruda. This article intends to approach the peculiarities of Pablo Neruda as a reader, on the basis of his dual status of reader who makes a free and deliberate use of texts, and as a reader that neglects the intellectuality of books. In this light, two aspects of Neruda's readings are examined: those associated with the literary tradition which the poet calls "the forest of literature", and extra-literary readings related to varied disciplines and the history of knowledge. The article also discusses the transition between textual reading and the reading of the world in Neruda.<br>

Publisher: Society for American Archaeology<br>
Issue: i23072521<br>

Author(s): Sabloff Jeremy A.<br>
Abstract: This study builds on the premise that local knowledge of limestone—and its workable characteristics—was foundational to landscape inhabitation in the Puuc region of Yucatán, México. Classic Maya architecture of the northern Yucatán generally is considered to represent the apogee of Maya construction prowess with extensive use of core-veneer masonry and the creation of tall, wide corbelled vaults. Less commonly discussed is the variable distribution of high-quality limestone across the Yucatán, the social matrix that undergirds the quarrying, transporting, and working of limestone, and the pronounced social differences materialized in stone architecture. This study explores these three topics by bringing to bear Yucatec Mayan linguistic evidence and excavation data from the archaeological site of Sayil, in the hilly Puuc region of Yucatán. That information provides a basis for understanding the development of a sprawling residential complex, the role that variable limestone quality played in its expansion, and serves as an index of intra-compound social difference. Late additions to the dwellings indicate that recognition of the cultural value of carved stone persisted long after masonry skills became attenuated. The durability of stone renders it a particularly effective—if underutilized—medium for interpreting social landscapes of the past. Este estudio amplifica la premisa de que el conocimiento de la piedra caliza—y sus propiedades arteseanales—fue una base fundamental para la ocupación del paisaje de la Región Puuc, Yucatán, México. En general, la arquitectura de los mayas de la época Clásica del norte de Yucatán se considera representativa del apogeo de su proeza arquitectónica con el uso extensivo de núcleos de piedra burda recubiertos de piedra labrada y la creación de habitaciones con bóvedas altas y anchas. Menos mencionados son la distribución geográfica variable de piedra caliza de alta calidad a través de Yucatán, la matriz social que permite la explotac~<br>

Abstract: A theory of the moral subject of cooperative relations proceeds from a different point of departure than a formalistic ethics based on individualism and rationalism. Shweder (Merrill-Palmer Quarterly, 1982, 28, 41–69) fails to see that, in this theory, persons communicate in order to co-construct knowledge and to maintain and promote mutual respect. Moral principles are, thus, cooperatively generated because validity is grounded in the structure of reciprocal relations.<br>

Abstract: Controlling for insecurities depends on a capacity to make inferences on the basis of experiences about the past, yet the use of knowledge about the past for anticipating and predicting future threats is highly problematic. This article examines the problem of governing individuals on the basis of what is available about their past deeds and social networks in governmental and commercial archives. It highlights the tension between administrative and private narratives about individuals, the former being constructed on the basis of minute details collected and stored about individuals since birth, and the latter referring to the accounts individuals offer of themselves. By applying the notions of ipse and idem identity developed by Paul Ricoeur, the article examines the two-way flow between memory and identity and the consequent concern that administrative narratives are blind to the ethical renewal of individuals, to the capacity of Man to extricate himself from the shackles of his past. To prepare the ground, the article considers some inherent limitations of biopolitics, pointing out that although biopolitics was classically concerned to govern both individual bodies and the body politic, administrative and governmental limitations have led states to govern the "average citizen" rather than individuals in their "individuality."<br>

Publisher: Department of Sociology, University of Kansas<br>
Issue: i23250013<br>
Date: 1 1, 2000<br>
Author(s): Chriss James J.<br>
Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Publisher: Humboldt State University<br>

Author(s): Jacobs Anton K.<br>
Abstract: This essay suggests Friedrich Nietzsche has a contribution to make to the theoretical enterprise of social science. Contemporary theorizing, reflecting an increased attention to language, has been focusing on the dialogical mode of production and, of course, on hermeneutics. This has led to a renewal of interest in Friedrich Nietzsche. In this essay, two alternative models of the hermeneutic circle are examined: one arising out of the work of the school of Konstanz; the other associated primarily with the work of Juergen Habermas. The former presents a circular image of the "conversational" situation; the latter portrays a time schedule of the process based on the psychoanalytic process of therapy. Nietzsche's contributions are suggested to be significant, in the first model, in regard to the mode of production and, in the second, the stage of the quasi-naturalistic turn. Nietzsche's way to truth is through constant and relentless criticizing. In contrast to the rationalistic practices of Western philosophy, Nietzsche exercised an art of interpreting based on the use of metaphor and aphorism. This practice seems to reflect Nietzsche's concern to communicate truth in a world he saw as inherently ambiguous and dynamic, thus, rendering propositional truth impossible. Nietzsche radically challenges the rational foundations on which we stand. Thus he presents us with a mode of knowledge production that reclaims traditions lost to science. In addition, Nietzsche shows, by word and example, that his existential approach offers a way to see life as a text and source for quasi-naturalistic forays toward understanding. In this way Nietzsche shows that the traditional concept of knowledge is a pseudo-concept by revealing the intimate and inseparable connection between life and knowledge. Knowledge is rooted in life; it is a manifestation of concrete psychological and political realities. Consequently, it makes sense not to ignore life as a source for explanation when examining~<br>

Publisher: Wiley Subscription Services<br>
Issue: i23351874<br>

Author(s): Doran Robert<br>
Abstract: To claim that Hayden White has yet to be read seriously as a philosopher of history might seem false on the face of it. But do tropes and the rest provide any epistemic rationale for differing representations of historical events found in histories? As an explanation of White's influence on philosophy of history, such a proffered emphasis only generates a puzzle with regard to taking White seriously, and not an answer to the question of why his efforts should be worthy of any philosophical attention at all. For what makes his emphasis on narrative structure and its associated tropes of philosophical relevance? What, it may well be asked, did (or could) any theory that draws its categories from a stock provided by literary criticism contribute to explicating problems with regard to the warranting of claims about knowledge, explanation, or causation that represent those concerns that philosophy typically brings to this field? Robert Doran's anthologizing of previously uncollected pieces, ranging as they do over a literal half-century of White's published work, offers an opportunity to identify explicitly those philosophical themes and arguments that regularly and prominently feature there. Moreover, White's essays in this volume demonstrate a credible knowledge of and interest in mainstream analytic philosophers of his era and also reveal White as deeply influenced by or well acquainted with other important philosophers of history. White thus invites a reading of his work as philosophy, and this volume presents the opportunity for accepting it as such.<br>

Abstract: This Study is divided in three parts. The first treats the problem of the relation between Scripture and reason considered as Springs of Moral Theology. Why a recourse to Bible should be necessary if conscience is already a Spring of moral knowledge? What kind of Priority has, for christian conscience, the Authority of the Gospel? The answer is that the light of the Gospel and the light of Reason are not two independant possibilities: there is interaction and complementarity between them: both Scripture and human Reason can be said to be, together, the soul of Moral Theology. The second part is about Hermeneutics. How can we apply the written Gospel to every day's reality? Exegesis tells me what the biblical text is saying: the text speaks. Hermeneutics tells me what the biblical text is saying to the modern man: the text speaks today. Hermeneutics try to liberate the actual meaning of the biblical text. In the third Part, the dialectic between faith and reason is applied to the moral of S. Paul. What was Paul's Filter in front of hellenism? How did he manage to borrow some principles of morality from the current morality and to refuse some others? What was his originality? How did he use Faith and Reason in building up his moral doctrine?<br>

Abstract: "Teaching" and "science" are notions that cannot be applied univocally to theology. Teaching implies that the mind masters its object scientifically through human methods; but who can master the knowledge which God alone possesses? There is need for God's Word himself to become Teacher (John 1,18). Thus, in the schools the sacra pagina will open itself up to become sacra doctrina. The method of theology is therefore always subordinate to a transcendent knowledge which finally remains inaccessible to any merely human science. Is science thereby degraded or on the contrary enhanced? Thomas Aquinas developed the idea of «subalternation». Blondel spoke of a science based on Christ «verified and realised in us». Today hermeneutics discovers that only the Glory of ultimate reality is capable of giving meaning to all the figures that announce it in human history and knowledge. On the other hand, the avatars of nominalism show that reducing theology and science to univocity results in perverting science as such.<br>

Abstract: This article critically revisits the Foucauldian perspective on modernity by exploring the constitutive importance of limits of transparency in relations of power and knowledge. It differentiates between Foucault's Panopticon as a model for modernity, which posits a total visibility of subject under modern gaze, and what I call cybernetic ways of knowing that posit the 'black box' of the inner self that is blocked from visibility. The case in point is a comparative study of two anthropologies — two groups of anthropological cadres — the American anthropologists who in the 1940s were involved in emerging Soviet studies, and Soviet anthropologists of the 1920s and 1930s who took part in Soviet reforms. The article draws attention to similarities in their perspective of images and notions of the enemy: the 'enemy of the people' within Soviet society and the Soviet society as the West's Cold War enemy. In doing so, the aim of this article is to develop an ethnographic perspective on state socialism that does not depend on a foundational dualist distinction between 'Soviet' and 'Western' or 'socialist' and 'capitalist' modernity as a starting point.<br>

Publisher: BRILL<br>
Issue: i23653923<br>
Date: 1 1, 2006<br>
Author(s): Taylor Betsy<br>
Abstract: The global justice movement reveals a diverse array of emergent publics striving politically for a sustainable world. Working partly from John Dewey, we try to illuminate democratic grounds for knowledge and action in these endeavors. We begin by situating Dewey's ideas in the politics of American history, especially historian John Diggins' countervailing approach to issues of authority, knowledge and opinion. Diggins, against Robert Westbrook and others, contends that Dewey's philosophy of politics chased radical democratic illusions, whereas he might have learned from Charles S. Peirce to uphold the boundary between professional communities and other entities including democratic publics. Dewey saw no democratic alternative to harness the political energy of ordinary people. We argue that Dewey had come to understand that a corporate state system of political economy had come to engulf both the liberal democratic polity and the professions. Dewey's political challenge to the professions and his illumination of the aesthetic ecology of democratic publics prefigure a democratic republican alternative that opens up a new basis for participation in the global justice movement confronting, among other obstacles, a transnational corporate state based in the USA. A Marxist-progressivist notion of the ongoing socialization of markets by corporate capitalism too often reinforces an anti-Populist intellectual sensibility that is coupled with, whether wittingly or not, either a social-democratic elitism or a revolutionary vanguardism. Globalization struggles need, on the contrary, a pragmatic vision of democratic publics instituting a true diversity of policies assuring a world-in-common. The fight for public spaces in the treacherous politics of civil society and global consumerism is a struggle against subjectivization. The fact that corporate state elitism, in the U.S. context, feeds on a rightist version of nationaism does not mean we can junk the history of democratic s~<br>

Abstract: In contrast to relying on something (on natural or social processes and on what others are expected to do), trust implies to believe more or less deeply in the other himself — in view of his genuine otherness which escapes our knowledge and calculation of risks. Having faith in others exposes us to severe disappointment in the case that they do not justify our belief, that is, our deep trust (which is faith). This essay examines trust in an historical perspective as a specific dimension of human vulnerability — in contrast to "systemic" trust.<br>

Date: 1 1, 1998<br>
Author(s): Sabete Wagdi<br>
Abstract: This article aims at explaining, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the formalist positivist method in answering the essential questions of constitutional Law, such as the validity of the constitutional norm, the sovereignty of the people which comes before the original constitutional act and the effects of a theory of values on the limitation of the revision power. On the other hand, it proposes an onto-axiological approach, which refers to the Philosophy of Law. A relevant methodology of constitutional science of Liberty helps the specialists to follow the progress of knowledge. It puts forward means for approaching the subject matter of science (the norm), the constitutional environment and the theoretical basis of the norm. Following this proposed method would help not only in describing the norms but also in checking their validity, their justification and their imperfection when compared with their aims. These thought processes are a never ending search, that is to say a characteristic of science itself.<br>

Author(s): WASINSKI Christophe<br>
Abstract: L'ambition de cet article est d'apporter une contribution en matière d'analyse interprétative du phénomène guerrier. Dans cette optique, il s'interroge sur les mécanismes de la pensée stratégique qui ont contribué à faire de la guerre moderne une pratique sociale jugée techniquement faisable et, partant de là, légitime pour les militaires. Pour ce faire, l'analyse proposée s'inscrit dans les champs, très proches sur le plan théorique, de la sociologie pragmatique (en s'inspirant d'auteurs tels que Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier et Francis Chateauraynaud) et de la sociologie des sciences (en s'appuyant surtout sur les travaux de Bruno Latour). D'une part, la sociologie des sciences a développé un très fertile questionnement portant sur la construction des faits scientifiques dont la présente étude s'inspirera largement. D'autre part, la sociologie pragmatique a élaboré un cadre de compréhension des actions collectives qui s'articule à l'enquête sur la construction sociale des faits. Grâce à ces deux approches, nous nous proposons d'enquêter sur la formation d'un régime d'expertise stratégique qui soutient la légitimité technique de l'emploi de la force militaire. Ensemble, la sociologie des sciences et la sociologie pragmatique apportent un éclairage particulièrement pertinent à la question de la guerre. This article is intended to contribute to the interpretative analysis of war. For that purpose, I investigate how some apparatuses located in strategic thinking help making modern war a social practice considered as technically feasible and, at the same time, legitimate for soldiers. In order to do that, I made use of two different but closely related theoretical fields, i.e., pragmatic sociology (finding inspiration in the work of scholars such as Luc Boltanski, Nicolas Dodier and Francis Chateauraynaud), and sociology of scientific knowledge (mostly by referring to the work of Bruno Latour). On the one hand, the sociology of scientific knowledge has developed a prod~<br>

Date: 1 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Scuccimarra Luca<br>
Abstract: Moving from Koselleck's most recent essays on Historik, the author explores the role played by historiography in the constitution of historicity as a peculiar experiential dimension of human existence. The essay focuses on the complex link between difference and repetition which, according to Koselleck's theory of experience, constitutes a "specific historical temporality" and its inner articulation. Actually, it is by exploring the "formal temporal structures" which constitute the horizon of historical intelligibility that Koselleck brings to light the decisive role that the point of view of historiography has for the constitution of man as the subject of historical knowledge and action. It is difficult to ignore the importance of this theory of historical temporalization in an age in which the End of History rhetoric tends to transform itself in a sort of media gospel.<br>

Abstract: Au Portugal, au début des années 1930, quand cesse l'expérience républicaine et laïque qui avait été très marquée par l'intervention politique des médecins, le psychiatre type était neurologue, positiviste et anticlérical. Avec le régime conservateur de l'Estado Novo, les médecins catholiques, dont les psychiatres, ont opéré une reprise en main qui, en quelques décennies, a changé la nature sociopolitique de la psychiatrie institutionnalisée. Nourris par de nouveaux courants scientifiques, religieux et idéologiques, les savoirs et les pratiques cliniques des psychiatres se sont accommodés du contexte politique et religieux de l'Estado Novo. Un de ces courants, la psychanalyse, a joué un rôle inattendu dans le rapprochement entre psychiatrie et catholicisme. Ce rapprochement est analysé, ainsi que ses conséquences épistémiques, pratiques et institutionnelles. In Portugal of the early 1930s, in the aftermath of the secularist regime of the First Republic, marked by a significant political involvement of doctors, the typical psychiatrist was a positivist and anticlerical neurologist. With the conservative regime of Estado Novo, Catholic doctors, including psychiatrists, undertook a takeover which, in a few decades, changed the socio-political nature of institutionalized psychiatry. Influenced by new scientific, religious and ideological trends, the knowledge and clinical practices of psychiatrists adapted to the political and religious context of Estado Novo. One of these currents, psychoanalysis, played an unexpected role in the rapprochement between psychiatry and Catholicism. This process of rapprochement is analysed as well as its epistemic consequences and institutional practices. En Portugal, en la década de 1930, tras la experiencia laica de la Primera República, muy marcada por la intervención de los médicos en política, el psiquiatra tipo era neurólogo, positivista y anticlerical.

Abstract: This article discusses the theoretical and methodological debates concerning the experience and consequences of upward social mobility between generations. The methods employed by researchers working on this subject are diverse, and the results they arrive at are sometimes contradictory. This article proposes, firstly, to give an overview of the different traditions of studying the experience of social mobility in order to identify the conditions for potential "cumulative" knowledge. In a second step, we argue that it is mainly through a study of the narratives of mobility that one can, simultaneously and comprehensively, grasp the ambivalence and multiplicity of effects that produce upward social mobility. Cet article revient sur les débats théoriques et méthodologiques sur l'expérience et les conséquences de la mobilité sociale ascendante intergénérationnelle. Les méthodes mobilisées par les chercheurs travaillant sur ce sujet sont multiples, et les résultats auxquels ils parviennent parfois contradictoires. Cet article se propose donc, dans un premier temps, de donner une vue d'ensemble des différentes traditions d'étude de l'expérience de la mobilité sociale afin de cerner les conditions d'une potentielle «cumulativité» des savoirs qu'elles produisent. Dans un second temps, nous défendons l'idée que c'est principalement à travers une étude du discours des personnes en mobilité que l'on peut, dans un même temps et dans un même élan, saisir l'ambivalence et la multiplicité des effets que produit la mobilité sociale ascendante.<br>

Abstract: The curriculum for biblical studies in the Israeli public high school system is designated by the official program of the ministry of education to be taught along essentially critical lines based on historical-philological research tools. The aim of this article is to expound on the cultural consequences and hermeneutical problems which are a direct product of this prescription, with emphasis on three major points: first, the fact that the official program of studies has completely disregarded contemporary hermeneutical approaches; second, the import of this hermeneutic deficiency given a literal reading of the biblical text which is meager in descriptive details but is hermeneutically saturated; third, the cultural status of the Bible class as sole agent of socialization pertaining to Jewish knowledge in Israeli public high-schools.<br>

Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Bell Allan<br>
Abstract: This article questions the aptness of 'discourse analysis' as a label for our field, and prefers the less reductionist concept of 'Discourse Interpretation'. It does this through drawing on ideas from the field of philosophical hermeneutics – the theory and practice of interpreting texts. It operationalizes and adapts the construct of the Interpretive Arc from the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur in order to address issues that are central to discourse work, including that of how we warrant the validity of our textual interpretations. The Interpretive Arc consists of six interlinked phases, which the article presents and exemplifies through discussion of a single text – the story of Babel. Phase I of the arc defines readers as being in a state of Estrangement before the text because of the distancing created by its written or technological form. Phase 2 is that of Pre-view, the state of opinion or knowledge that readers bring to a text. At phase 3, a first reading forms readers' Proto-understanding, their initial 'guess' at what the text means. Then processes of Analysis (phase 4) test and evidence the validity of alternative readings, limiting the interpretations which can plausibly be taken from a text. Three byways of interpretive analysis are challenged and discarded: the dominance of author intention, structuralist analysis and limitless polysemy. Analysis then leads into 5, the phase of informed Understanding of the matter or injunction of the text, of what is disclosed or unfolded before the text. The Interpretive Arc is completed in phase 6, Ownership. Here, through processes of critique of their own and the text's ideologies and of fresh listening, readers are led to a new self formed by the matter of the text. There is a dialectic amongst Analysis, Understanding and Ownership, with each informing and modifying the other. The approach emphasizes interpretation as the heart of discourse work. The 3000-year-old narrative of Babel is a subject as well as an object h~<br>

Article Title: Text as action, action as text? Ricoeur, λογοσ and the affirmative search for meaning in the 'universe of discourse'<br>
Publisher: SAGE Publications<br>
Issue: i24049943<br>
Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Scott-Baumann Alison<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur placed a great deal of importance upon text and the interpretation of text. Bell accepts this by virtue of his extended analysis of the story of Babel, and I hope to offer ways of extending and developing Bell's arguments to incorporate the ethical demands that Ricoeur placed upon text, upon our interpretation of text and upon action as a form of readable text. This will not include a commentary on discourse analysis, which I am not qualified to give. Ricoeur differed from the structuralist tradition in that he saw the relationship between language and life as taking a dialectical form: debate that presumes the possibility of altering one's position by grappling with different views, and often taking inspiration from Hegelian dialectics, with their contrasting polarized views and the eventual attempt at affirmative common ground. The term λογοσ (logos) was first used in a philosophical way by Heraclitus to give us the principle of order and knowledge, and yet for Heraclitus the world was dominated by conflict and change. Ricoeur studied this tension within logos between order and disorder, partly by his writing about language and his work on signs and symbols, partly through metaphor and narrative and also through his insights on translation. For him, all these are facets of the need for both Explaining and Understanding as forms of interpretation of language, ethics and action. Ricoeur's work on logos provides us with an approach that asks whether ethics controls language or vice versa or both and how this fits in with structuralism and later movements. For Ricoeur, signs (words, texts) are not the centres of our perceptual experience. At the heart of our perception are our motivations and our actions, for which we must take responsibility in a sort of provisional affirmation that we will keep trying. In so doing we must doubt (be suspicious of) our own motives just as much as those of others, and see action as a form of readable text.<br>

Abstract: Usando métodos da História e da Antropologia, investigou-se a prática do aborto no Sul do Brasil na primeira metade do século XX. O exame de fontes primárias e as entrevistas com mulheres idosas visaram auscultar um enorme silêncio em torno dessa prática que deixa poucos vestígios em termos de fontes históricas e que reveste de segredos a memória. O texto apresenta dados registrados pela pesquisa e reflete sobre a diversidade das representações em torno do aborto, as ambigüidades dos sujeitos em relação ao tema. A prática do aborto precisa ser entendida como estando inserida num contexto de poder. Os sujeitos operam com conhecimentos de várias origens e dentro de uma rede moral composta de malhas contraditórias. By using methods of the fields of History and Anthropology, this study investigated the practice of abortion in southern Brazil in the first half of the twentieth century. The examination of primary sources and interviews with elderly women intended to unveil a huge silence around this practice, which leaves very few historical sources to be investigated, and hides those memories. This text presents data collected by this survey and analyzes the diversity of representations over abortion and the ambiguities that this theme causes on the subjects involved. The practice of abortion must be understood as inserted into a context of power. The subjects operate from multiple sources of knowledge and within a morality network composed of contradictory elements.<br>

Abstract: Este artículo está orientado a precisar las relaciones entre experiencia corporal de las mujeres y testimonio. Un largo hábito de subalternidad ha expropiado a las mujeres de la posibilidad de tomar la palabra sobre sus experiencias corporales. Es por ello la importancia que tiene la singularidad de sus testimonios, que implica tomar la palabra en una situación de imposibilidad del lenguaje; es siempre el relato de un acontecimiento traumático del que se habla, pero del que también podría no hablarse. El sujeto/a que toma la palabra da cuenta de un conocimiento que - si bien es precario - constituye un saber del que antes no se tenía registro. Es que el testimonio pone en juego la relación entre la lengua y el archivo. Exige una subjetividad que atestigüe sobre la posibilidad misma de hablar, un/a sujeto capaz de pronunciar lo "inaudito", produciendo con su palabra una intervención ética. La autoridad del testimonio depende de una relación inmemorial entre lo indecible y lo decible, produce una palabra que nombra una experiencia singular. Las palabras de las mujeres que relatan experiencias corporales nombran una dimensión fundamental de nuestra experiencia, la de la diferencia sexual produciendo un dislocamiento en la presunta neutralidad de la lengua. Se trata de una reflexión que abre la posibilidad de poner palabras a lo innombrable. The aim of this article is to specify the relationships between corporal experiences of women and testimony. A long habit of subordination has expropriated the women of the possibility of speaking of their bodily experiences. Thus, the importance of the singularity of their testimonies, which implies beginning to speak in a situation of impossibility of the language. This is always the account of a traumatic event, but which could also not be spoken about. The individual who speaks shows an awareness that, even though insufficient, constitutes a knowledge that has not been registered before. The testimony brings into play the link b~<br>

Abstract: Before any significant attempt is made to read Negro-African history, the first task is to conquer its field of research. The critical works of Frobenius, Westermann and Bauman, Delafosse, Homburger, Murdock, Leakey and Cheikh Anta Diop provide us with appropriate means of investigation (which still require to be refined) in order to obtain a profound, inner knowledge of the Negro-African social tradition. Prehistory must become a major science in the teaching profession — especially in Africa — because it offers man a general outline of the first consequences of his past before the appearance of writing. No Africanist or African historian can allow himself to by-pass this branch of study. The same applies to Egyptology and to African linguistics, sociology and ethnology. Diop has used the last three sciences to retrace the migrations of African peoples, to establish their cultural unity and to rediscover the continuity of Negro-African history. The study of African, Greco-Roman, Arab and European documents (whether oral or written, archaeological, linguistic or sociological) gives us information concerning the appearance of homo faber in Africa about 5,500,000 years ago, the Egypto-Nubian civilizations, the African Neolithic worlds, pre-colonial Africa, the Arab invasions, the slave-trade, colonization and the present-day national liberation struggles and the formation of new States. The African cultural world has its roots in the Tertiary Period and it is beyond doubt that the biological substratum of humanity is Negro or Negroïd (C.A. Diop and the discovery of Asselar Man by the Augiéras-Draper Saharan expedition in December 1927), that Negroes were in Europe during the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and helped in the formation of today's Europoïd races. The author uses the social structures of the Pharaonic Ancient Empire (2778 - 2423 B. C.) as models to describe the history of Negro-African societies in their ensemble and contrasts the former with thos~<br>

Abstract: This paper discusses Hans-Georg Gadamer's account of what he sees as a major change in the approach to the Western philosophical and aesthetic traditions that began in the second half of the eighteenth century, and the results of this change today. According to Gadamer, these traditions ceased to be binding at this time and became objects of historical research. Instead of being seen even as potential sources of insight, traditional knowledge claims and works of art were subjected to historical and aesthetic analysis. And Gadamer holds that these approaches have partially come to encompass the present as well. Thus, modern art has often downplayed cognitive and pedagogical tasks in proceeding in a purely aesthetic, playful way. And the study of history has been seen as providing insight into the contextually determined nature of presuppositions, those of the modern age included. According to Gadamer, this unduly limits the possibilities of both art and history to provide learning.<br>

Abstract: There is an obvious parallel between foundationalism, which ignores history in working out the conditions of knowledge, and radical relativism, which contends that by virtue of its own historical character there is no way to choose among different interpretations, all of which are "equally good." Might it not be, rather, that the recent historicist attack on the very idea of rationality is as damaging as foundationalist objections against the plurality of conceptual schemes or frameworks? Can philosophy maintain the traditional distinction between the form and content of knowledge, between rationality and historicity between doxa and episteme?<br>

Author(s): ESS CHARLES<br>
Abstract: I expand the metaphor of computing as philosophical laboratory by exploring philosophical insights gleaned from examining computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies in terms of the cultural values and communicative preferences they embed, as well as their interactions with the values and preferences that define diverse cultures in which the technologies are deployed. These empirically grounded data provide new insights for debates in philosophy of technology, notions of the self, and epistemology. This approach to utilizing data drawn from the cultural encounters facilitated by CMC technologies further suggests more ambitious ways of making philosophical use of CMC venues as a laboratory for testing and refining basic claims and hypotheses. The approach also uncovers other grounds that should encourage philosophers to become interdisciplinarians – not only for the sake of perhaps developing new sorts of insights and even forms of knowledge but also in order to shape and contribute to a global ethic and a Socratic education needed to sustain cultural diversity as CMC envelops the globe.<br>

Abstract: For anthropologists working on the topic of human rights, fieldwork often consists of collecting narratives documenting experiences of violence and loss. Drawing on research with human organizations in Argentina, this article questions this methodological focus that is often related to human rights activism. While these narratives are often treated as organic accounts, they are also products of the human rights movement. Analyses that fail to address this larger institutional context may end up reproducing conventionally held knowledge. By exploring the larger interconnections between narrative, human rights and trauma, I conclude by questioning the prevalent normative assumptions about narrative. Pour l'anthropologue travaillant sur le sujet des droits humains, le travail de terrain consiste souvent à recueillir des récits documentant des expériences de violence et de perte. À partir de recherches menées auprès d'organismes de défense des droits humains en Argentine, cet article interroge ce parti-pris méthodologique qu'on associe souvent au militantisme pour les droits humains. Alors que ces récits sont souvent traités comme des comptes-rendus organiques, ils sont aussi des produits du mouvement pour les droits humains. Les analyses qui omettent de tenir compte de ce contexte institutionnel plus étendu peuvent finir par reproduire des connaissances conventionnellement admises. En explorant les interconnexions plus étendues entre les récits, les droits humains et les traumatismes, je conclus en remettant en question les a priori normatifs courants relatifs aux récits.<br>

Abstract: All humans by nature desire to know and humans are distinguished from the rest of creation by the miracle of knowledge. If all cultures have developed their own forms of knowledge, the spectacular success of a certain form of knowledge, science, notably in the west, has frequently led to its being exclusively attributed to the west. Yet science remains only one of many forms of knowledge and the west only one of its producers. The success of the west has tended to marginalize other forms of knowledge and other contributions to knowledge and, thus to impoverish an otherwise potentially rich and complex world knowledge landscape. It has tended to inhibit or even prevent the development of a really universal, human-knowledge project. Its very success, due essentially to its sustained application to technology, has enabled the development of a false superiority over other forms of knowledge and a real power hegemony of the west over other peoples. The future of lasting peaceful co-existence in the world may depend, in part, on the emancipation of other knowledge modes and forms. De par leur nature, tous les êtres humains éprouvent le désir de savoir, et les humains se distinguent des autres êtres de la Création par le miracle de la connaissance. Bien que toutes les cultures aient développé leurs propres formes de connaissance, le succès spectaculaire, notamment en Europe, d'une forme particulière de la connaissance, la science, a fait que cette dernière a été exclusivement attribuée à l'Occident. Pourtant, la science ne représente qu'une des nombreuses formes de la connaissance et l'Occident n'est qu'un producteur de celle-ci, parmi tant d'autres. Le succès de l'Occident a contribué à marginaliser les autres formes de connaissance et autres contributions à la connaissance, et ainsi, a fini par appauvrir le paysage international de la connaissance, qui autrement, aurait pu être extrêmement riche et diversifié. Ce succès de l'Occident a fini par inhiber, voire empêcher le~<br>

Author(s): Gordon Lewis R.<br>
Abstract: In celebration of the fortieth anniversary of CODESRIA, an institution from the Global South devoted to taking responsibility for the production of social science knowledge, this article explores what it means to pursue such a task under the threat of colonial imposition at methodological and disciplinary levels, which, the author argues, carries dangers of disciplinary decadence marked by the fetishisation of method. The author offers alternatives through what he calls 'a teleological suspension' of disciplinarity, and raises the question not only of the decolonisation of knowledge but also norms. Pour célébrer le quarantième anniversaire du CODESRIA, une institution des pays du Sud dévouée dans la production de connaissances en sciences sociales, cet article explore les implications de mener une telle tâche sous la menace de l'emprise coloniale à des niveaux méthodologiques et disciplinaires, qui, selon l'auteur, provoque des dangers sur la décadence disciplinaire marquée par la divination de la méthode. L'auteur propose des alternatives à travers ce qu'il appelle « une suspension téléologique » de l'interdisciplinarité, et pose la question non seulement de la décolonisation de la connaissance, mais aussi celle des normes.<br>

Abstract: Truth is attributed by hermeneutical phenomenology not only to science but also to art and literature. According to Ricoeur, its veritable bearer is the expression of experience that can take artistic and literary forms as well as scientific ones. However, truth in this sense cannot be defined as a correspondence with a ready-made reality, nor can it be reduced to any internal coherence in our knowledge of the world. What is, then, its precise meaning in this context? The two terms mentioned in the title—'redescription' and 'refiguration' of reality—indicate the two answers Ricoeur gives to this question. The similarities and the differences between these two answers are submitted to an inquiry in the following paper, which, relying upon Ricoeur, adumbrates the outlines of a phenomenological and hermeneutical approach to truth.<br>

Publisher: Presses de Sciences Po<br>
Issue: i24672910<br>
Date: 9 1, 2014<br>
Author(s): Mazurel Hervé<br>
Abstract: L'histoire des sensibilités suscite encore une méfiance persistante, avant tout parce que son projet intellectuel demeure mal identifié, parce que l'historiographie a souvent laissé penser que ses origines s'ancraient uniquement dans la continuité du projet de Lucien Febvre et de l'histoire des mentalités à la française. Or, en vérité, celle-ci n'est autre que la traduction historiographique d'un mouvement philosophique beaucoup plus ample et ancien, né du basculement incarné par Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche et Sigmund Freud, ces penseurs du soupçon, qui nous ont appris à repérer derrière les idées, la raison et la conscience, le rôle des désirs et des appétits, le jeu des pulsions et des sentiments. Rendant ainsi l'homme moins transparent à luimême, l'historien du sensible vise, outre à restituer l'historicité de notre vie sensible, à réévaluer la part des affects dans la détermination des conduites humaines. Pour ce faire, il s'appuie également sur la riche nébuleuse des savoirs critiques élaborés ensuite, dans l'Allemagne de la première moitié du 20e siècle, sous les appellations de « psychologie sociale » ou « historique » ou, à la manière nietzschéenne, de « psychologie des profondeurs ». The history of sensibility still continues to elicit suspicion, first and foremost because this intellectual project remains poorly defined, historiography often having led us to believe that its roots stemmed solely from Lucien Febvre's endeavours and the French history of mentalities. And yet in truth, the history of sensibility is nothing less than the historiographical translation of a much broader and older philosophical movement, born of the tipping point provoked by Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Those great sceptical thinkers taught us to unmask the role of desires, appetites and impulses behind our ideas, reason and consciousness. In addition to recreating the historicity of our lives of sensibility and thus rendering man less transparent to himse~<br>

Author(s): Morton Herbert Donald<br>
Abstract: Philosophy and worldview both have a religious starting point, so Dooyeweerd and Vollen-
hoven maintain. The question however is whether philosophical thought is conditioned in
its own turn by worldview. Although in Vollenhoven and even more so in Dooyeweerd
there is a tendency to deny the latter, their standpoint on the issue is not entirely consistent.
Vollenhoven writes: 'What the view of life is to non-scientific knowledge, philosophy is to
scientific knowledge' ('Schriftgebruik en wijsbegeerte', p. 8). Yet as it turns out, philosophy
on the one hand and life and world view on the other are not completely separated in his
conception, for he continues: 'scientific knowledge never loses all traces of what is non-
scientific'. Dooyeweerd observes: 'Philosophy cannot take the place of a life- and world-view,
nor the reverse, for the task of each of the two is different' (A New Critique, vol. 1, p. 128);
and elsewhere: Ά life- and world-view may not be "elaborated" philosophically. It must
elaborate itself (Ibid., p. 158). Nonetheless, he goes on to say also: Ά life - and world-view
should come to theoretical clarity in philosophic thought' (Ibid., p. 165). I call such state-
ments happy inconsistencies!<br>

Abstract: Precision is important here. Popma's formulation is that transcending coincides with
placing oneself 'over against' the creatural, whereby this opposing-oneself-to-the-creatural is
identified with the opposition characteristic of the theoretical attitude of thought. In
Dooyeweerd there is still another link in the chain: religious self-knowledge, c.q. transcending
the cosmic order of time, is not as such theoretical; rather, it is the condition that makes the
'over against' in theorizing possible. Dooyeweerd distinguishes the supra-temporal 'above' (tran-
scendence, religious self-knowledge) and the temporal 'over against' typical of the Gegenstand
relation. In Popma 'above' and 'over against' more or less coincide.<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: François Laplanche a été un éminent spécialiste de l'histoire de l'exégèse catholique. S'il a consacré ses dernières années à Loisy, notamment par l'édition de son grand manuscrit sur La crise de la foi dans le temps présent, c'est d'abord à la figure de Lamennais qu'il s'est longuement intéressé. C'est ce qu'explique cet article qui cherche à identifier le sens et les raisons de la quête par F. L. de la science catholique. Ce concept, mis en circulation dans les milieux mennaisiens, occupe une place centrale par sa volonté d'inclure tous les savoirs, y compris les plus nouveaux, dans une succession de révélations dont le catholicisme serait l'aboutissement. Cette manière de penser théologiquement l'histoire a pu faire un temps sa place à une science des religions, perçue comme la quête des traces de la révélation primitive; elle s'est vite révélée incapable de prendre en compte les exigences d'une approche scientifique des écritures et de ce fait elle a joué un rôle non négligeable dans le long hiver de l'exégèse catholique. François Laplanche was an eminent scholar of the history of Catholic exegesis. He spent his last years studying Loisy, notably via the edition of his large manuscript on The Contemporary Faith Crisis, but his first concern was the figure of Lamennais. This article tries to identify the meaning and the reasons of François Laplanche's quest of Catholic science. This concept, which circulates in mennaisian circles, occupies a central place because of his willingness to include all forms of knowledge, including the newest ones, in a succession of revelations of which Catholicism would be culmination. This way of theologically thinking history gave way for a time to a science of religions, seen as the quest of the traces of primitive revelation; it soon proved unable to take into account the requirements of a scientific approach of the scriptures and thus it has played a significant role in the long winter of Catholic exegesis.

Fieldwork with mobile street vendors in an African city may confront the fieldworker with the problem of locating the 'field' and attaining access to it, both spatially and temporally. As I will show by reference to my fieldwork with a group of shoe vendors on the streets of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the frictions that occurred at the beginning of my fieldwork nevertheless ignited a process of ethnographic knowledge-gaining that led me to understand the importance of temporality and rhythmicity for the shoe vendors' practices. In their active engagement with the spatio-temporal landscape of the city, the street vendors organised their practices as an experiential rhythm that unfolded as sequences of rising and subsequently declining cognitive and corporeal tensions. These rhythms did not flow smoothly, but were necessarily interspersed with disturbances and frictions by the rhythms of other pedestrians in the streets, whose attention the street vendors tried to attain.<br>

Abstract: For the disregard of context see Appleby, Hunt, and Jacob, Telling the Truth About
History, 207-31 • The stress on "how" rather than "why," on process rather than causation, on
identity and knowledge rather than interests and needs is embedded in the new criticism based
on culture, gender, and rhetoric. See also Joan Wallach Scott, Gender and the Politics of History

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1985<br>
Author(s): Sternberg Nancy<br>
Abstract: Hayden White's perhaps richest and most profoundly argued book, The Content of the Form, touches many nerves in the American historical profession. The entirety of the book, from its premises through its most thoughtful exegeses of historical writing, insists that linguistic form is the primary carrier of content in historical writing, indeed, in historical knowledge. This insistence on a respectful and careful attention to the formal usages of nonfiction prose, truth-claiming language, goes well against the grain of American tastes. As de Tocqueville presciently and correctly predicted, when Americans take to literature in a serious way, they won't have much patience with precise matters of form. Hayden White's narrative theory has had uphill work to penetrate this pervasive indifference, especially among historians. He has been joined in recent decades by Paul Ricoeur, whose Time and Narrative, beginning from different premises and a slightly different question, arrives at a sympathetic and complementary analysis of historical narrative. In spite of White's published hesitations about the political/philosophical tendencies of Ricoeur's work, I am convinced that their books are mutually supporting and, in an important cultural sense, belong together. Altogether, however, I do feel that the main import and justification of this present essay must rest on my quite serious reading of Hayden White's best joke, a profound shaggy dog story about the historian monk of St. Gall.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i342993<br>
Date: 5 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Carr Steven G.<br>
Abstract: If, as many historians and theorists now believe, narrative is the form proper to historical explanation, this raises the problem of the terms in which such narratives are to be evaluated. Without a clear account of evaluation, the status of historical knowledge (both in itself and in all those social, political, and other contexts in which appeal to historical explanation is made) remains obscure. Beginning with the view, found in Hayden White and others, that historical narrative constitutes a meaning not reducible to the factual content it engages, this essay argues that such meaning can arise only through a synthesis of cognitive and normative discourses. Narrative combines "heterogeneous" language games in such a way that neither appeal to "truth content" nor to "justice" suffices to decide the question of which of two competing historical explanations is, as a whole, superior. Examining in critical detail the opposed positions on this issue articulated by two recent theorists-Frank Ankersmit ("narrative idealism") and David Carr ("narrative realism")-the paper concludes that the debate between those who hold that historical narratives should be judged in essentially cognitive terms and those who hold that they should be judged in essentially political terms cannot be resolved and that a philosophical view of historical narrative that is neither realist nor idealist needs to be developed.<br>

Publisher: Wesleyan University<br>
Issue: i342969<br>
Date: 5 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): Bernstein Cushing<br>
Abstract: Simon Schama's Dead Certainties is assessed in the light of the complex relationship between history and fiction, which share some limited common territory. Examples are cited from Mary Chesnut, Oscar Handlin, Georg Lukács, Herman Melville, Robert Penn Warren, P. D. James, and Wallace Stegner. Schama's book has some kinship to the skepticism found in "the new historicism" and "deconstruction," but also has its own differences from the fashionable "inverted positivism" which concludes that since evidence is not an open window on reality, it must be a wall precluding access to it. Only two of Schama's three narratives cohere, and while uncertainty may be a common theme, his historian's judgment tends to dissipate much of the mystery his fictionalizing technique creates. His idea of historical uncertainty arises from a fallacy that a "communion with the dead" (as in Henry James's The Sense of the Past), possible only for a time-traveler, represents authentic knowledge. Affirming that asking questions and relating narratives are not mutually exclusive, Schama joins the company of philosophers (Collingwood, Dray, Mink, Ricoeur) and historians (Hexter, John Lukacs, Veyne, and Strout) who have also made this case.<br>

Abstract: Meaning is one of the recent terms which have gained great currency in mathematics education. It is generally used as a correlate of individuals' intentions and considered a central element in contemporary accounts of knowledge formation. One important question that arises in this context is the following: if, in one way or another, knowledge rests on the intrinsically subjective intentions and deeds of the individual, how can the objectivity of conceptual mathematical entities be guaranteed? In the first part of this paper, both Peirce's and Husserl's theories of meaning are discussed in light of the aforementioned question. I examine their attempts to reconcile the subjective dimension of knowing with the alleged transcendental nature of mathematical objects. I argue that transcendentalism, either in Peirce's or Husserl's theory of meaning, leads to an irresolvable tension between subject and object. In the final part of the article, I sketch a notion of meaning and conceptual objects based on a semiotic-cultural approach to cognition and knowledge which gives up transcendentalism and instead conveys the notion of contextual objectivity.<br>

Abstract: Lerner's interpretation is that as a result of the Fall, "humanity, in this act of
acquiring a higher level of 'knowing,' assumes the burden of distinguishing between good
and evil and of choosing the good in order to be saved"; but so far as humanity's newly-won
knowledge is, in part, sexual knowledge, the burden falls more heavily on the woman,
because God forbids her the "free and open sexuality of the fertility-goddess," symbolized,
at the time Genesis was written, by the serpent (The Creation of Patriarchy [New York: Oxford
UP, 1986] 196-97).<br>

Abstract: This essay traces the involution of anthropological understanding from the 1950s to the present. It is shown that as the conception of "doing ethnography" changed from sensing patterns to reading texts, and from reading texts to writing culture, so too did the content of anthropological knowledge change from being multi-sensory to being self-centred. The essay also proposes a way of escaping the tunnel-vision of contemporary (post-modern) ethnography — namely, by treating cultures as constituted by a particular interplay of the senses which the ethnographer must simulate before making any attempt to describe or evoke the culture under study. /// Cet article trace l'enchevêtrement qu'a subi l'étude de l'anthropologie depuis les années cinquante à nos jours. L'auteur démontre que le concept de "faire de l'ethnographie" a changé radicalement — de la perception sensorielle à la lecture des textes et de cette lecture à l'acte d'écrire une culture. Également, le contenu des connaissances anthropologiques a subi un changement du multi-sensoriel à l'égocentrique. L'article propose comment s'éloigner du champ de vue plutôt étroit de l'ethnographie contemporaine (dite post-moderne) en suggérant que les ethnographes traitent les cultures telles que constituées par l'action réciproque particulière des sens qui doivent être simulés avant que les ethnographes puissent essayer de décrire ou d'évoquer la culture en question.<br>

Abstract: El ensayo explora la dimensión cultural de la experiencia misionera de los jesuitas en China durante la primera edad moderna y analiza en particular la relación entre evangelización y escritura. Es a nivel de la cultural civility que el misionero jesuita logra identificarse con el "hombre de letras" chino. Es a nivel de la bibliofilia, del coleccionismo, de la exégesis y del bricolaje como jesuitas italianos y literatos chinos podrán entrar en diálogo. Los primeros, adoptando la definición de "letrados europeos", resaltan la intrínseca afinidad con los otros, los wenren 文人. Los libros representan el aspecto más significativo del encuentro entre estos dos grupos humanos. Interactuando con la élite política e intelectual china, los jesuitas intentaron poner en práctica un programa educativo basado en el modelo de los collegia de la Compañía en Europa. El proyecto nunca fue puesto en marcha, pero mediante la producción de libros para y sobre China, los jesuitas contribuyeron a insertarla en un proyecto universal de circulación de saberes. /// This essay explores the cultural dimension of the Jesuit missionary experience in China during the early modern period while focusing on the particular relationship between evangelization and writing.

Abstract: En el artículo se reflexiona sobre las diversas formas de relación con el pasado que lo hacen contemporáneo del presente. El autor aborda tres temas que permiten discutir diversas propuestas teóricas y presenta ejemplos sacados de sus más recientes investigaciones. Estos temas son en primer lugar la construcción del pasado por las obras literarias, particularmente teatrales; luego, la presencia del pasado de la literatura misma en cada momento del presente de la escritura literaria y, finalmente, la competencia entre las representaciones del pasado producidas por la ficción narrativa y la construcción del saber histórico propuesto por la operación historiográfica. Semejante trayectoria permitirá la discusión de los conceptos de «energía social», de «campo cultural» y de «representancia» tal como los proponen Stephen Greenblatt, Pierre Bourdieu y Paul Ricœur. In this article, the various forms of relationship with the past which make it contemporary of the present are approached. The author deals with three subjects that allow various theoretical proposals and present examples drawn from his more recent researches. These subjects are first the construction of past by literary works, particularly theatrical; then, the presence of past of literature itself in every moment of present in literary writing, and, finally, the competence between representations of past produced by narrative fiction and construction of historical knowledge proposed by historiography operation. A trajectory such as this will allow discussion of concepts of «social energy», «cultural field», and «representance», as are proposed by Stephen Greenblatt, Pierre Bourdieu y Paul Ricœur.<br>

Abstract: Historians today frequently feel torn between the requirements of basic research (which implies scientific method and independent scholarship) and the demands of a society asking for relevance and readability. Two trends have developed within the craft since the nineteenth century: one, positivist and professional, oriented towards the sole production and transmission of knowledge; the other trying to broaden the historian's aims and to make history socially useful (hence the introduction of the notion of "applied history"). After analysing the assets as well as the perils of both approaches, the article argues that are conciliation between them appears possible provided a number of methodological requisites are met. Modern historians should not be afraid of new functions and new tasks in society.<br>

Date: 9 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): George Jim<br>
Abstract: Recent debates in International Relations have seen some of the characteristic dichotomies of the discipline under severe and sophisticated challenge. The proposition, for example, that the study of International Relations, is somehow "independent" of mainstream debates on theory and practice in the social sciences is now widely rejected. The disciplines change in attitude on this issue owes much, in the 1980s, to the influences of an as yet small group of scholars who have infused the "third debate" in International Relations with an appreciation for previously "alien" approaches to knowledge and society, drawn from interdisciplinary sources, which repudiate (meta) theoretical dualism in all its forms. Utilizing the sponge term "postpositivism" Yosef Lapid has concentrated on an important aspect of the "third debate," one which has seen positivist based perspectives repudiated in favor of critical perspectives derived, primarily, from debates on the philosophy of science. This paper takes a broader view of the "third debate" in focusing on some of the broader patterns of dissent in social theory that are now evident in its literature. It argues that for all the differences associated with the new critical social theory approaches, theirs is critique with common purpose. Its purpose: to help us understand more about contemporary global life by opening up for questioning dimensions of inquiry which have been previously closed off and supressed; by listening closely to voices previously unheard; by examining "realities" excluded from consideration under a traditional (realist) regime of unity and singularity. Its purpose, reiterated: the search for "thinking space" within an International Relations discipline produced by and articulated through Western modernist discourse.<br>

Abstract: From the perspective of Gabriel Marcel’s juvenile writings, most notably
         Fragments Philosophiques(1909-1914) andJournal Métaphysique(1914-1923), this study discuss the first theoretical statute of the experience of God. This reflexive movement, strictly speaking, phenomenological-existential is based (as background) on the critique of absolute knowledge (modern idealism and scientism) which, according to Marcel, is an unavoidable contradiction: at the same time, it affirms the being, it denies the being. What draws attention is the fact that such explanatory model is transposed and, therefore, applied using the classical formulation of the so-called problem of the existence of God, of which theodicy has one of the most eloquent and emblematic metaphysical discourses. For the young French thinker, God cannot be verified or justified as an ontological proof: God is the Inverifiable Absolute, since it has to be experienced in the act of faith, in the expression of love and grace.<br>

Abstract: L'œuvre de Max Weber commence à être mieux connue du public français grâce à la traduction d'un nombre croissant de ses écrits et à la parution d'un grand nombre d'ouvrages le concernant. L'examen de ces publications récentes montre que les polémiques opposant sociologues et philosophes à propos du «vrai» Weber, polémiques qui se sont intensifiées au cours des années 1960, polarisent aujourd'hui encore le débat sur cet auteur. Néanmoins, les nouveaux éclairages concernant «l'épistémologie» wébérienne permettent de mieux cerner le dilemme auquel Weber a été confronté, dilemme qui reste le nôtre: comment un chercheur en sciences sociales peut-il justifier et défendre sa pratique empirique, sans abandonner le terrain des sciences sociales au profit d'une argumentation sur les fondements de la connaissance empruntée aux philosophes néokantiens? Max Weber's work is beginning to enjoy a wider audience in France due to the translation of a growing number of his writings and the publication of many works devoted to him. An examination of these recent publications shows that the polemics opposing sociologists and philosophers with regard to the "real" Weber – arguments that intensified during the 1960s – are still alive today. Nevertheless, the new perspectives on Weberian "epistemology" allow us gain a sharper view of the dilemma that once confronted Weber and continues to confront us: how can a researcher in the social sciences justify and defend his or her empirical practice without abandoning the terrain of the social sciences and shifting to an argument on the foundations of knowledge borrowed from neo-Kantian philosophy?<br>

Abstract: Dans le cadre du séminaire Bonheur et Travail qui a débouché sur une enquête de l'Insee, Céline Bessière et Frédérique Houseaux ont pu « suivre des enquêteurs » et tirer de leurs observations de terrain quelques conclusions sur la production de données statistiques. Une passation mouvementée du questionnaire auprès d'un salariéagricole agricole montre l'importance de la situation d'enquête ainsi que celle des malentendus sur les mots utilisés. Les auteurs proposent de s'appuyer sur ces «ratés» de la relation d'enquête pour mettre en lumière le rôle souvent oublié de l'enquêteur. Elles suggèrent enfin de rapprocher enquêteurs et concepteurs et d'utiliser les données produites en gardant à l'esprit le travail de traduction qui a présidé à leur fabrication. Christian Baudelot et Michel Gollac en tirent la conclusion qu'il faut «faire avec» et refusent de renoncer aux gains de connaissance qu'apportent les enquêtes statistiques. Ils plaident qu'à condition de ne pas s'y enfermer, on peut les utiliser pour combattre l'ethnocentrisme même qui a pu présider à leur recueil. Florence Weber s'interroge sur la nature de l'interaction entre enquêteur Insee et enquêté: «relation anonyme et formulaire d'enquête» se conjuguent pour la rapprocher des relations qu'entretiennent d'autres agents subalternes de l'État avec les administrés. En jouant sur la nature des questions posées, on déplace simplement le lieu où se produisent les malentendus, à la fois instructifs et constructifs. Enfin, Alain Desrosières se demande «à quoi sert une enquête». Si les mêmes critiques, formulées depuis des décennies, n'ont jamais fait obstacle à la répétition des enquêtes statistiques, c'est que leur enjeu n'est pas seulement cognitif mais aussi politique. Il faut donc restituer la visée d'usage des enquêtes et les moyens sociaux des produits et des énoncés statistiques. Within the scope of the Happiness and Work seminar that led to an Insee survey, Céline Bessière and Frédérique Houseaux were able t~<br>

Abstract: Ce sont quelques temps forts du parcours scientifique de l'historien Carlo Ginzburg qui sont abordés dans cet entretien. Évoquant les rencontres et les lectures qui ont déterminé sa formation d'historien, évaluant l'aventure de la microhistoire, C. Ginzburg aborde également les caractéristiques majeures de sa démarche, et revient sur les principaux débats auxquels il a pris part, ainsi que les questions que ne manquent pas de soulever ses travaux: le statut des témoignages figurés en histoire, les rapports entre morphologie et histoire, les modalités de la connaissance en histoire. The highlights of the scientific career of the historian Carlo Ginzburg are discussed in this interview. C. Ginzburg discusses the encounters and readings that had a decisive effect on his training as an historian and evaluates the adventure of micro-history. He also discusses the main features of his approach and comes back to the principal debates in which he has taken part, as well as the questions inevitably raised by his work: the status of figurative testimony in history, the relationship between morphology and history and the methods of historical knowledge.<br>

Abstract: French-speaking academic literature makes abundant use of the notions of anchoring and rootedness when dealing with dwelling and residential practices. Though the metaphoric origin of these notions can be evoked, and even exploited by the authors, it is generally glossed over. This article seeks to revive the metaphorical dimension of these terms by adding two others – mooring and docking. Our goal is twofold. First, we demonstrate that by taking the terms seriously, it is possible to have them designate different types of relationships to place, which directly use underlying images. Second, we discuss how these images participate in the poetics of knowledge that distills the effects of truth, whose motivations must be sought out in the major epistemological options that have been adopted.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'The Uncanny', XVII, p. 220. There is, of course, a vast literature on Freud' s
concept of the uncanny, most of which is not concerned with the self-civilization relation
that is explored in this essay. Julia Kristeva, for example, examines the uncanny in the
context of the self-other relation. 'The uncanny strangeness', she writes, 'allows for
many variations: They all repeat the difficulty I have in situating myself with respect to
the other.' See Julia Kristeva, Strangers to Ourselves, trans. Leon S. Roudiez (New York,
1991), p. 187. While Kristeva's interpretation underscores the place of the uncanny in
human intercourse, Samuel Weber finds the uncanny important in forming a correct
theory of knowledge, one that does not hold to the Cartesian illusion of an objectivizing,
insulated and reliable cognition. 'Whereas for Descartes the essential condition for
attaining certitude was the subject's withdrawal from a world that in its alterity could no
longer be relied on, it is precisely the discovery that such withdrawal is a fata morgana,
an unsustainable construct that informs the misrecognition, that constitutes the uncanny. '
See Samuel Weber, The Legend of Freud (Stanford, CA, 2000), p. 20. For a political
interpretation of the concept, see Derrida's brief but illuminating discussion of the
uncanny element in Marxism, in Jacques Derrida, Specters of Marx (New York, 1994),
pp. 172-5. For a general discussion of Freud's theory of memory, see Richard Terdiman,
Present Past: Modernity and the Memory Crisis (Ithaca, NY, 1993).<br>

Abstract: With regard to the "meaning" of the Oedipus myth, Lévi-Strauss concludes
that it "has to do with the inability, for a culture which holds the belief
that mankind is autochthonous... to find a satisfactory transition between
this theory and the knowledge that human beings are actually born from the
union of man and woman... By a correlation of this type, the overrating
of blood relations is to the underrating of blood relations as the attempt
to escape autochthony is to the impossibility to succeed in it" (pp. 91-92).<br>

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive firms are composed of multiple communities with specialized expertise, and are often characterized by lateral rather than hierarchical organizational forms. We argue that producing knowledge to create innovative products and processes in such firms requires the ability to make strong perspectives within a community, as well as the ability to take the perspective of another into account. We present models of language, communication and cognition that can assist in the design of electronic communication systems for perspective making and perspective taking. By appreciating how communication is both like a language game played in a local community and also like a transmission of messages through a conduit, and by appreciating how cognition includes a capacity to narrativize our experience as well as a capacity to process information, we identify some guidelines for designing electronic communication systems to support knowledge work. The communication systems we propose emphasize that narratives can help construct strong perspectives within a community of knowing, and that reflecting upon and representing that perspective can create boundary objects which allow for perspective taking between communities. We conclude by describing our vision of an idealized knowledge intensive firm with a strong culture of perspective making and perspective taking, and by identifying some elements of the electronic communication systems we would expect to see in such a firm.<br>

Issue: i27582855<br>
Date: 6 1, 1990<br>
Author(s): Payen Pascal<br>
Abstract: The article proposes to analyse the fictional aspects in history writing. Indeed, history doesn't borrow from fiction its compositional techniques only; the discursive strategy which consists in narrating a story is in fact part of historical knowledge as such. A study of Cambysis's biography in Herodotus (II,l-III,66) leads us to grant a very specific function to Book II dealing with Egypt—nearly always considered as some sort of useless overgrowth—and to the "secondary remarks" concerning the Greek world (III,38, 39-60). Setting the Egyptian civilization as a foil enables Herodotus to establish a parallel between expansionist ideas and folly and he includes the Greeks in a plot itself critical of helleno-centric ideology. Our methodological approach owes as much to Ricœur's hermeneutics, as to H. R. Jauss's esthetics of reception and to the various streaks of narratology (narrative syntax and "mise en abîme"), with a view to showing that, once replaced in its "Erwarthunghorizonte", the form of the historical narrative makes full sense.<br>

Issue: i27652935<br>
Date: 10 1, 2008<br>
Author(s): Kliger Ilya<br>
Abstract: Ilya Kliger addresses the question of Mikhail Bakhtin's intervention in modernist discourse by taking a step back from Bakhtin's views on modernist literature and outlining instead a more general Bakhtinian conception of the modernist condition as characterized by what Kliger calls "a crisis of authorship." The article focuses on Bakhtin's early work in narratological aesthetics and situates it within the longue durée context of debates about the status of the subject of aesthetic experience and, more generally, of knowledge, debates that can provisionally be seen as originating at the end of the eighteenth century and coming to a head within the intellectual and creative milieu of twentieth-century modernism. Early Bakhtin helps us formulate a specifically modernist—by contrast with what will be called "transcendental" and "realist"—critique, a critique not limited to the field of literary analysis alone but applying to all forms of thinking that either presuppose abstract subject-object division or rely on modes of synthetic reconciliation.<br>

Abstract: International and national agendas are redesigning the terms of intellectual-property (IP) Laws to create cultural property for developing nations. Debates over IP and cultural-property "rights" or legal needs for "protection" are critical to anthropology's effort to reflect on how the production of knowledge, even culture itself, is variously construed to originate with, or "belong to," particular individuals, ethnic communities, or nation-states. We explore the implications of two Indonesian legal documents to show the disjunction between discourses of regional artists who describe the ritual exchanges, relationships, and transgenerational messages their arts shape and (inter)nationalists legal initiatives that bypass artists' concepts of process, access, and authority in an effort to disembed and control ritual-based expressions as products with exclusive owners.<br>

Abstract: El autor propugna que el conocimiento en el ámbito de las ciencias sociales no se puede comparar fácilmente con el conocimiento puramente filosófico o el conocimiento histórico ni reducirlo a uno u otro. De hecho, tiene sus raíces en la comunidad y, por lo tanto, da lugar a una empresa colectiva. En esencia, se basa en una interacción entre seres humanos y presupone una relación de confianza mutua entre el investigador y los miembros del grupo social que se va a investigar en una situación dada. Un enfoque cualitativo, que sitúe en un mismo plano al investigador y a los investigados, parece por tanto necesario. Cuesta creer que una persona pueda estar dispuesta a confesar sus experiencias (Erlebnisse) a una grabadora o a un cuestionario rígidamente precodificado. The Author's contention is that knowledge in social science cannot be easily compared and reduced either to purely philosophical knowledge or to historical knowledge. In fact, it is community grounded and therefore it results in a collective enterprise. In essence, it is based on an interaction among human beings and it presupposes a relation of mutual trust between the researcher and the members of the social group to be investigated in a given situation. Therefore, a qualitative approach whereby researcher and researched are in the same footing and involved in a face to face relationship seems to be necessary. It is hard to believe that somebody would willingly confess his/her Erlebnisse to a tape-recording machine or to a rigidly precodified questionnaire.<br>

Abstract: This Note reviews shortcomings and claims of discourse analysis (DA). In particular, it focuses on the relationship between DA and reflexivity. It argues that DA could not succeed as its supporters originally thought, because DA has not dealt adequately with the issue of reflexivity. Even now that has turned to such issues, DA has a limited interpretation of reflexivity that is related to the change in sociological focus from scientific beliefs and knowledge to the study of texts for texts' sake.<br>

Publisher: Duke University Press<br>
Issue: i212746<br>
Date: 7 1, 1996<br>
Author(s): Spitzer Lloyd<br>
Abstract: Gerard Noiriel's recent book, Sur la "crise" de l'histoire (Paris, 1996), describes a social and intellectual crisis of fragmentation among contemporary professional historians and then proposes to restore professional unities through a disciplinary commitment to pragmatic ideas and methods. According to Noiriel, social inequalities within the profession and a recent turn toward postmodern, philosophical skepticism have undermined professional unity and the traditional paradigm of historical knowledge. In response to these perceived threats, Noiriel advocates a pragmatic philosophy that will help historians recognize the practices and language they share. Yet Noiriel's pragmatic quest for a professional paradigm offers few solutions for the profession's social stratifications, and his pragmatism remains as dependent on philosophy as the historical theories he condemns. There are nevertheless intriguing ironies in Noiriel's use of an American philosophy to criticize recent American uses of French theories.<br>

Abstract: Before World War II the intellectual climate of American sociology was congenial to the growth of a sociology of knowledge akin to Mannheim's. Yet in the postwar period American sociologists committed themselves to ahistorical theory, positivist methodology, and team research; their "scientistic" sociology did not permit the historicism, relativism, and holism necessary to Mannheimian analysis. Currently, however, convergent trends in a number of disciplines--not only sociology but also philosophy, anthropology, literary criticism, and the histories of ideas, science, and art--favor a revival of the Mannheimian program. Analysts of culture now seek to integrate the sociological goals of "explanation" and "understanding"--the formulation of quasi-laws of behavior, based on identification of the social structural elements of culture production, and the interpretation of the subjective meaning of culture, based on recovery of actors' intentions. Their research program requires investigation of the peculiar sociohistorical circumstances that condition actors' perceptions, necessitating attention to the cognitive content of culture. This article surveys both the theoretical justifications for such a research program and recent exemplifications of it, focusing on anlyses of what Mannheim termed "objective culture"--such symbolic vehicles for conceptions as religion, the arts, science, and political thought that acquire independent existence, becoming subject to diverse interpretations.<br>

Author(s): White Sheldon H.<br>
Abstract: The rhetoric of social work often seeks its legitimacy and authority on the idea that knowledge can be translated into skills. Knowledge is made in universities in the form of timeless, objective, context-free truths about people and social institutions. Such knowledge rationalizes and justifies the professional practices of social work. It is not clear, however, that the knowledge-into-skills story fully explains social work practices. Practice is often ineffective and tends to throw social workers into moral quandaries, leaving them to practice in a context of faith and doubt. In addition to skills, social workers share values, purposes, the wielding of and submission to power, and mythic stories. Timely, value-expressive, contextual knowledge helps social work to create and maintain social solidarity and to shift its dispositions of skills, purposes, power, and myth to keep up with the pace of social change.<br>

Article Title: Toward a New Materialist Semiotics: Undoing the "Dialectic's" Philosophical Hypocrisy<br>
Publisher: University of Wisconsin Press<br>
Issue: i30154168<br>

Abstract: While the Dialectic of Enlightenment (1944; 1947) is often judged to be too limited a cultural critique, it is still widely accepted as pioneering cultural criticism, a mix of critical discourse analysis, hermeneutics, and semiotics. This article contests this reputation by turning to a source that Horkheimer and Adorno are at pains to occlude: Ernst Cassirer's Philosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923-29). Drawing on the tradition of eighteenth-century German Christology revived by the Young Hegelians in general and F.W.J. Schelling in particular, Cassirer evolves a critical strategy broader than that in the Dialectic, yet clearly implied by it. Most particularly, Cassirer's Schelling analysis discriminates philosophy, art, and religion as forms of knowledge and forms of epistemological critique, where Horkheimer and Adorno recast the art of the Bildungsbürger to occlude Cassirer's innovation, a new materialist semiotics that offers cultural critique in the broader terms that the Dialectic's critics would favor.<br>

Abstract: In an extensive interview, Rodenbeck responds to questions posed by various colleagues on the significance of travel, travel literature, and cultural encounters. Rodenbeck elaborates his views and his convictions, marked in their unfolding by his encyclopedic knowledge. Starting with a personal narrative, he explores the roots of his fascination by travel and by other cultures and explains how he came to live and teach in Egypt and retire in France. His attitudes towards globalization, orientalism, and typologies of travel are illuminated by examples drawn from historical travelers from different continents and epochs, from his lived experience as an expatriate, and from literary sources. ﻓﻲ ﻫﺬﻩ ﺍﻟﻤﻘﺎﺑﻠﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺴﻬﺒﺔ٬ ﻳﺠﻴﺐ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﻋﻦ ﺃﺳﺌﻠﺔ ﻋﺪﺩ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﺰﻣﻼﺀ ﺣﻮﻝ ﻣﻐﺰﻯ ﺍﻟﺴﻔﺮ٬ ﻭﺃﺩﺏ ﺍﻟﺮﺣﻠﺔ٬ ﻭﺗﻘﺎﻃﻌﺎﺕ ﺍﻟﺜﻘﺎﻓﺎﺕ ﻭﻳﺸﺮﺡ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﺁﺭﺍﺀﻩ ﻭﻣﻌﺘﻘﺪﺍﺗﻪ ﺑﺘﺠﻞ ﹴﻳﻨﻢ ﻋﻦ ﻣﻌﺮﻓﺘﻪ ﺍﻟﻤﻮﺳﻮﻋﻴﺔ٠ ﺑﺎﺩﺋﺎً ﹰ ﺑﺴﺮﺩﻳﺔ ﺷﺨﺼﻴﺔ٬ ﻳﺴﺘﻜﺸﻒ ﺍﻟﻤﺤﺎﻭﹶﺭ ﺟﺬﻭﺭ ﺍﻧﺒﻬﺎﺭﻩ ﺑﺎﻟﺴﻔﺮ ﻭﺍﻟﺜﻘﺎﻓﺎﺕ ﺍﻷﺧﺮﻯ٬ ﺷﺎﺭﺣﺎ ﹰﻛﻴﻒ ﺟﺎﺀ ﻟﻴﻌﻴﺶ ﻭﻳﺪﺭّﺱ ﺑﻤﺼﺮ٬ ﺛﻢ ﻳﺘﻘﺎﻋﺪ ﺑﻌﺪ ﺫﻟﻚ ﻓﻲ ﻓﺮﻧﺴﺎ٠ ﻭﺗﻀﻲﺀ ﺃﻣﺜﻠﺔ ﻋﺪﻳﺪﺓ ﻣﺴﺘﻘﺎﺓ ﻣﻦ ﺭﺣﻠﺔ ﺗﺎﺭﻳﺨﻴﻴﻦ ﻣﻦ ﻗﺎﺭﺍﺕ ﻭﺃﺯﻣﻨﺔ ﻣﺨﺘﻠﻔﺔ٬ ﻭﻣﻦ ﺧﺒﺮﺗﻪ ﻛﺄﺟﻨﺒﻲ ﻣﻐﺘﺮﺏ٬ ﻭﻣﻦ ﺍﻃﻼﻋﺎﺗﻪ ﺍﻷﺩﺑﻴﺔ٬ ﺭﺅﻯ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﺣﻮﻝ ﺍﻟﻌﻮﻟﻤﺔ٬ ﻭﺍﻻﺳﺘﺸﺮﺍﻕ٬ ﻭﺃﻧﻤﺎﻁ ﺍﻻﺭﺗﺤﺎﻝ٠<br>

Abstract: Judith Roof remarks with regard to lesbian
fiction: "While the drive of conventional history is to know, lesbian fiction histories frus-
trate the possibility of total knowledge and define the desire for mastery as unfulfillable
from the start. Not fulfilling the desire to know sustains desire, continues it so that
desire, like history, is a paradox: the desire is to desire not to have a desire fulfilled; it is
the desire for an unfulfilled desire" (111)<br>

Abstract: The radical constructivist assertion that the student constructs his or her own knowledge as opposed to receiving it "ready made" echoes the classical debate as to whether the human subject constitutes the world or is constituted by it. This paper shows how the philosophical traditions of post-structuralism and hermeneutic phenomenology offer approaches to effacing this dichotomy and how this forces a re-assertion of the teacher's role in the student's constructing of mathematical knowledge. It is also shown how hermeneutic phenomenology provides an opportunity to ground constructivist mathematical thinking in the material qualities of the world.<br>

Abstract: El artículo presenta los elementos constitutivos de una aproximación interpretativa a las Ciencias Sociales. Empieza explicando por qué los marcos interpretativos constituyen un tamiz ineludible de nuestra apropiación cognitiva del mundo que nos rodea, y cómo las metáforas (entendidas como una forma particular de adquirir conocimientos) pueden proveer los principios que los organizan. Explica además el sentido en el cual la interacción social constituye un proceso de creación de significados, y por qué la interpretación de esos significados debe ser el propósito fundamental de las Ciencias Sociales. /// The article presents the constituent elements of an interpretive approach to Social Sciences. It begins by explaining why interpretive frames constitute an inevitable filter for our cognitive appropriation of the world that surrounds us and how metaphors (understood as a particular way of acquiring knowledge) can provide the principles that organize them. It also explains the way in which social interaction constitutes a process of creating meaning and why the interpretation of these meanings should constitute the fundamental purpose of Social Sciences.<br>

Abstract: Social theorists' recent interest in global capitalism is partially driven by their sense of "being behind" in a changed and changing world. It is also part of their larger efforts to critique the present. In this article, I seek to find analogues of this sense of temporal incongruity between knowledge and its objects in the Tokyo financial markets. My focus is on the anxieties and hopes animating some Japanese securities traders' life choices. I argue that these traders' differing anxieties and hopes resulted from their divergent senses of the temporal incongruity among strategies, workplaces, and Japan's national location vis-à-vis the United States. Drawing on a parallel between social theorists' and traders' efforts to generate prospective momentum in their work, I propose that anthropologists investigate the work of temporal incongruity in knowledge formation more generally.<br>

Publisher: American Educational Research Association<br>

Author(s): Wittig Zeus<br>
Abstract: Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.<br>

Abstract: Faut-il vraiment doubler désormais chaque haut lieu de mémoire par un "équipement d'interprétation" et d'accueil où s'opèrerait un "rattrapage de la mémoire par l'histoire"? La question hante sans aucun doute les collectivités locales, soucieuses aussi bien de "devoir de mémoire" que de rentabilité touristique. Elle est toujours actuelle, par exemple à Colombey à propos du général de Gaulle. Elle a été posée avec une intensité particulière à Oradour de 1993 à 1999. En voici la version personnelle d'un chef de projet qui là-bas tenta de gérer l'impossible, avant d'être remercié. En 1993, le conseil général de la Haute-Vienne a décidé la construction d'un équipement culturel d'accueil et d'information destiné à recevoir les visiteurs des ruines du village d'Oradour-sur-Glane martyrisé par la division SS "Das Reich" en juin 1944. Ce "Centre de la mémoire" fut inauguré en 1999 par le président de la République. L'auteur, ancien chef du projet, décrit les difficultés de sa mise en œuvre, car la communauté d'Oradour, détentrice de la mémoire des victimes, s'opposa souvent aux initiatives publiques et, plus largement, à toute vision critique de l'événement dont une meilleure connaissance aurait pu, pourtant, hâter le travail du deuil. /// In 1993, the general council of the Haute-Vienne decided to build a welcome and information cultural center for the visitors to the ruins of Oradour-sur-Glane, martyr zed by the SS division "Das Reich" in June 1944. This "Memory Center" was inaugurated in 1999 by the President of the Republic. The author, the former head of the project, describes the difficulties of its implementation, because the community of Oradour, the holder of the victims' memory, often took issue with the public initiatives and any critical vision of the event even though more knowledge of it could have hastened the period of mourning.<br>

Author(s): Winch David P.<br>
Abstract: The question addressed in this article is how people come to know the foundational axioms of their moral systems as true and correct. Drawing on my fieldwork among the Himba of northwestern Namibia, I argue that the most potent form of intellectual conviction is not generated through the external manipulations of ritual, but through a deeply internal experience in which moral knowledge coalesces with a subjectively perceived experience of timeless universality. / Dans cet article, l'auteur cherche à savoir comment les individus en viennent à savoir que les axiomes fondateurs de leur système moral sont véridiques et corrects. À partir de son travail de terrain chez les Himba du nord-ouest de la Namibie, il affirme que la forme la plus puissante de conviction intellectuelle ne naît pas de manipulations externes dans le cadre de rituels, mais d'une expérience profondément intériorisée au cours de laquelle le savoir moral fusionne avec l'expérience subjective d'une universalité intemporelle.<br>

Abstract: Hannah Arendt's and Charlotte Delbo's writings about the Holocaust trouble our preconceptions about those who do evil and those who suffer evil. Their jarring terms "banal evil" and "useless knowledge" point to limitations and temptations facing scholars of evil. While Arendt helps us to resist the temptation to mythologize evil, Delbo helps us to resist the temptation to domesticate suffering.<br>

Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i371617<br>

Author(s): Ricoeur Michael<br>
Abstract: The last thirty years have brought about a fundamental revision of historical epistemology. So intense a concentration on the nature of history as a form of inquiry has diminished attention given to the thing that history inquires into: the nature of the past itself. Too readily, that entire domain has turned into a place for dreams, as Hayden White put it: a lost world only available now through the imagination of the author and subject to aesthetic whim. The next thirty years will, I propose, be the period in which ontology returns to the center of historical theory. And nothing short of the reconceptualization of the past-indeed of time itself-must be its objective. It must achieve that objective, moreover, in establishing arguments that are congruent with what revisions of epistemology have taught us about the limits of historical knowledge and the inevitability of textual representation. This paper enters this field by discussing some of the issues involved in rethinking the place of time in historical constructions since Bergson. It demonstrates the confusions inherent in spatial reductions of temporality, which historians have done so much to entrench rather than eradicate, and argues that historians have yet to accommodate the fundamental conceptual shifts inaugurated by Heidegger. It then moves to propose a methodological doctrine to which I have given the name "chronism" and seeks to sketch the utility of such a doctrine for bringing one form of presence-that of authenticity-back into the domain of historical study. Doing so invites a number of conceptual and practical difficulties that the paper will address in its conclusions; these may disturb those who have closed their minds to anything beyond the present. Taking ontology seriously interferes both with structuralist assumptions about the nothingness of time and with some of the styles of historical representation that have become fashionable in the postmodern climate. There may be painful lessons to b~<br>

Abstract: Drawing on two studies of children aged between seven and 10 years this article explores their narratives of themselves, families, sibling and peer relationships. Their narratives were full of push-pull and contradictory processes. The children moved towards knowledge as well as a disavowal of 'reality' about their families and material conditions. Critically they revealed profound wishes for something better alongside the knowledge that 'this is it'. This article focuses on theorizing children's understandings of and relationships to social and material life in order to argue that meanings matter and meanings have matter. Narratives are social in two critical ways: they involve reaching out and connecting with others, and narratives are constructed within and through the social sphere, while simultaneously they are shot through with conscious and unconscious fantasies. Children are moving towards being in a complex - engaged in and inhabiting many relationships.<br>

Author(s): Flyvbjerg Bent<br>
Abstract: Este artículo examina cinco malentendidos comunes sobre la investigación mediante estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no podemos generalizar a partir de un solo caso y, por lo tanto, el estudio de un solo caso no puede contribuir al desarrollo científico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras otros métodos son más adecuados para verificar las hipótesis y construir las teorías; 4) el estudio de caso contiene un sesgo hacia la verificación, y 5) suele ser difícil resumir estudios de caso específicos. El artículo explica y corrige estos malentendidos uno por uno y concluye con el principio kuhniano de que una disciplina científica que carece de una elevada cantidad de estudios de caso concienzudamente desarrollados es una disciplina sin producción sistemática de ejemplares, y una disciplina sin ejemplares es una disciplina ineficaz. La ciencia social debe reforzarse mediante la realización de más estudios profundos de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: (1) Theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; (2) One cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; (3) The case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; (4) The case study contains a bias toward verification; and (5) It is often difficult to summarize specific case studies. The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more good case studies.<br>

Abstract: El presente estudio revisa los presupuestos teóricos de los estudios culturales y el área de la cultura popular en Gran Bretaña a partir de 1950. Esta esfera de lo popular fue definida por la sociedad de masas mediado el siglo xx, y por quienes como Theodor W. Adorno y Max Horkheimer teorizaron sobre la cultura que le es propia. Los artistas modernos y sus críticos abrieron entonces una brecha insalvable entre el arte y los objetos comerciales de dicha cultura. El primero se reservó la esfera del saber y del arte, mientras que los segundos pasaban a engrosar la esfera del mercado social. La noción moderna de cultura de masas estableció el precedente de las consideraciones del británico Raymond Williams y de los estudios culturales posteriores a él. La corriente británica trató de superar esta comprensión moderna de la cultura. /// This study is a conceptual revisión of the background of cultural studies and the popular culture field in Great Britain in the 1950s. This academic domain was defined by mass society in the middle of the 20th century, and by those who, like Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer, spoke about mass culture. Modern artists and their critics then created an insuperable divide between art and the commercial objects of popular culture. The former claimed the sphere of art and knowledge, whereas popular culture belonged to the social market. Based on this división, the modern notion of mass culture set the precedent of Raymond Williams' popular culture concept, and the theoretical formulation of other authors who developed the British cultural perspective. It was a project which tried to overeóme this modern vision of culture.<br>

Abstract: This article aims to "unthink" influential philosophical articulations of the crisis of Europe in order to articulate a non-Eurocentric epistemological position that aims to give a consistent expression to the interrelational approach of wprld-systems analysis. This alternative epistemology demands and foments a postimperial Utopia and requires no less than the death of ideals that defend the epistemological superiority of European Man. An analysis and critique of works by Edmund Husserl, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Walter Mignolo lead to the formulation of a positive conception of the crisis of Europe and to weak versions of Utopia and "colonial difference." The alternative articulation of these concepts aims to make more flexible and productive the links between knowledge and location. In this way, this article intends to bridge the gap between Wallerstein's world-systems approach and Mignolo's concern with the limits of Eurocentric critiques of Eurocentrism.<br>

Author(s): Henriques Fernanda<br>
Abstract: O presente artigo pretende dar sentido à afirmação feita, mais do que uma vez, por Paul Ricoeur, de que a sua filosofia poderia ser vista como um kantismo pós-hege-liano. Nesse contexto, o artigo procura abordar o pensar ricoeuriano mostrando de que modo ele se instaura e se desenvolve no horizonte kantiano de uma filosofia dos limites do saber. Essa abordagem é desenvolvida em dois momentos. O primeiro dirige-se à leitura que Paul Ricoeur faz da Crítica da Razão Pura de Kant. O segundo centrar-se-à em três momentos fulcrais da Filosofia de Paul Ricoeur - a definição do seu projecto Filosofia da Vontade, a figura própria da sua Hermenêutica e o filosofema inovação semântica - evidenciando em cada um deles a ressonância da herança kantiana. /// Aim of this article is to to explore the meaning of Paul Ricoeur's persistent characterization of his own work as a post-Hegelian Kantism. In view of this end, the article demonstrates that Ricoeur's thinking is at once rooted and developed within the horizon of Kant's critical philosophy of limits in regard to knowledge. This can be shown by first considering Ricoeur's reading of the first Critique, and then centering on three decisive moments of Ricoeur's philosophy, to wit, the formulation of the project developed in the Philosophy of Will, the shape of his theory of hermeneutics, and his notion of semantic innovation that can be conceived as a philosophema. The Kantian influence can be seen to resonate in all three instances.<br>

Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
Issue: i40013929<br>
Date: 4 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Fink-Jensen Kirsten<br>
Abstract: In this paper Kirsten Fink-Jensen suggests how a phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective can contribute to the knowledge of learning and teaching processes in music education in school The philosophical frame is Danish philosophy of life, represented by Knud Ejler Løgstrup, and Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of body, both pointing to the wholeness of mind and body in all kinds of actions. Within this framework interpretation is an epistemological, practical-hermeneutic activity based on different analytical methods. Phenomenologically, experiences of music are constituted in an intertwinement of personal, cultural, and local meaning. The challenge facing the teacher is then to understand what becomes meaningful to persons in a given situation. 'Bodily dialogue' is a metaphor of a hermeneutic process of understanding that highlights the importance of bodily aspects in the teacher's answer to a child's musical attuned articulations. This focus can facilitate children's learning processes and change and qualify the teacher's didactic reflections on the impact and progression of music lessons.<br>

Issue: i40014414<br>
Date: 12 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Morujão Alexandre Fradique<br>
Abstract: O sentido da intersubjectividade em Marcel liga-se à intenção de "restituir à experiência humana o seu peso ontológico", o que obriga à recusa do racionalismo contemporaneo, caracterizado pelos principios de inerencia e de objectividade, adoptando uma epistemologia pluralista e relativista em que o universal se degrada em colectivo e o necessário em repetível. O conhecimento válido para todos reduz-se ao verificável, tudo o mais é apenas objecto de crença, da ordem do subjectivo. Esta concepção situa-se no ambito do problemático, isto é, do objectivo, do posto completamente em face de mim. O mundo actual situa-se a esse nivel, corresponde à esfera do ter e a análise desse mundo mostra que ha na experiéncia humana como tal aspectos que transcendem o problemático, pertencendo ao dominio do mistério, que diz respeito à esfera do ser. Para, alcançar o que Marcel designa por mistério ontólogico analisamse, fora do registo lógico, certos dados propriamente espirituais, como a fidelidade, o amor, a esperança, que nos conduzem a um eu, subjectividade livre, que é experimentado com referencia a um tu. O compromisso entre eu e tu traduz-se em disponibilidade e apelo e estabelece uma relagao que é o nós, um co-esse, uma intimidade espiritual. Dentro da economia do pensamento marceliano ever é conceder crédito a um tu. No limite, se o tu for absolute, o credito deverá ser também absoluto. O tu absoluto, Deus, é existente suprapessoal e nunca pode ser tratado como objecto e, portanto, demonstrado, mas está presente à invocação. Afim da crença temos a esperanga que, no significado auténtico, se situa num contexto de provação. Distingue-se do optimismo e do desejo, transcende toda a técnica, não se desenvolve sobre um saber. É própria dos seres desarmados e nisso reside, misteriosamente, a sua eficácia. Consiste num esperar em, experiéncia absoluta no piano do mistério e certeza de transcender o que se encontra em perigo na provação, e participação numa realidade absoluta que me e~<br>

Abstract: Este texto procura encontrar um princípio hermenêutico que dê acesso a uma leitura de unidade da obra de Ricoeur. Nesse contexto, experimenta a tese de que a filosofia ricoeuriana se deixa interpretar como um caso no interior do pensamento crítico de herança kantiana, como uma filosofia dos limites da razão, não no sentido originário, de investigação sobre as condições de possibilidade do conhecimento objectivo, mas por poder ser lida como uma pesquisa sistematica para encontrar as condições em que é possível ao pensar, à discursividade, dizer, num saber constituído, a existência. Assim, tratar-se-á do significado "crítico" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire que, sendo a primeira obra do projecto da Filosofia da Vontade. lhe determina as condição de possibilidade, ao propor os princípios teóricos fundantes da constituição de um discurso unitário sobre o humano enquanto expressão de uma existência histórica e livre. /// Ce texte veut trouver un principe herméneutique qui donne accès à une lecture unitaire de l'oeuvre de Ricoeur. C'est dans ce contexte que l'on avance la thèse selon laquelle la philosophie ricoeurienne doit être interprétée comme un cas à l'intérieur de la pensée critique d'héritage kantien, comme une philosophie des limites de la raison, non pas dans le sens d'investigation des conditions de possibilité de la connaissance objective, mais parce que cette philosophie peut être lue comme une recherche systématique en vue de trouver les conditions dans lesquelles le penser, le discours, peut, en un savoir constitué, dire l'existence. On s'occupera donc du sens "critique" de Le volontaire et l'involontaire qui, comme première oeuvre du projet de la Philosophie de la l'olonté, assigne à celle-ci ses conditions de possibilité en proposant les principes théoriques qui fondent la constitution d'un discours unitaire à propos de l'humain en tant qu'expression d'une existence historique et libre. /// This text seeks to find a hermeneutical principle which permit~<br>

Issue: i40014462<br>
Date: 9 1, 1993<br>
Author(s): Virgoulay René<br>
Abstract: L'infini de la volonté voulante n'exclut pas la finitude de l'homme; il l'accentue plutôt dans la mesure où l'homme est incapable de saturer son désir et de s'achever par lui-même. Cette finitude apparaît comme disproportion ontologique dans l'écart du savoir, du pouvoir et du faire, comme faillite de la volonté voulue dans l'expérience de la faute meurtrière. L'ultime tentative de l'autosuffisance humaine consiste à borner le désir et à l'investir dans un fini absolutisé, comme en témoignage l'action superstitieuse. Dans le cas de l'option positive, qui est de "vouloir l'infini" , peut-on concevoir l'achèvement de l'action comme "divinisation" de l'homme? Oui, a condition de ne pas en faire un donné de nature, ni un acquis de l'homme, mais un accueil du don surnaturel qui exige l'aveu de l'insuffisance. /// O infinito da vontade profunda "voulante" não exclui a finitude do homem; antes a acentua na medida em que o homem é incapaz de saturar o seu desejo e de se completar por si mesmo. Esta finitude aparece como desproporção ontológica no distanciamento do saber, do poder e do fazer, como falência (faillite) da vontade concreta "voulue" na experiência da falta mortífera. A ùltima tentativa da autosuficiência humana consiste em limitar o desejo e em investir num finito absolutizado, como o testemunha a acção supersticiosa. No caso da opção positiva, que é de "querer o infinito", pode conceber-se o acabamento da acção como "divinizacao" do homem? Sim, se não se fizer disso urn dado da natureza, nem uma aquisição do homem, mas urn acolhimento do dom sobrenatural que exige a confissão da insuficiência. /// The infinity of the "willing will" ("volonté voulante") does not exclude man's finiteness. It rather stresses it, by the fact that man is unable to completely satisfy his desire, and to fulfil himself on his own. This finiteness appears as ontological disproportion far from both knowledge, power and acting, and as deficiency ("faillite") of the "willed will" ("volonté~<br>

Abstract: O estruturalismo levistraussiano tern urn vasto alcance critico em relação ao conceitochave da filosofia do conhecimento que é a razão. Alicerçando a racionalidade num inconsciente universal, num sistema formal categórico, e postulando urn isomorfismo entre a natureza e a cultura, Lévi-Strauss faz uma critica nova da razão humana. Esta não pode ser concebida como consciência, como representação, tão ao gosto do racionalismo moderno e de algumas filosofias contemporàneas, nem perspectivada dialectica e temporalmente, como o fazem o positivismo e o hegelianismo. /// Levi-Strauss' structuralism strongly criticizes "reason", a key-concept in the philosophy of knowledge. Grounding rationality upon a universal unconscious and upon a categorical formal system, and postulating an isomorphism between nature and culture, Strauss produces a new criticism of human reason. Reason can no longer be conceived as it is both in modern rationalism and in some contemporary philosophical trends, as consciousness, as representation. Nor can it be thought of from either a temporal or a dialectical point of view, as it is in positivism and in hegelianism.<br>

Author(s): da Veiga Manuel Alte<br>
Abstract: Na la meditação «em que se pretende não falar de valor», o autor esforça-se por manter um discurso linear sobre o interesse humano de pensar e agir relativamente a um tema tão fundamental, que parece quase impossivel evitar a «petitio principii». Pode-se sintetizar a primeira meditação nestas duas alíneas: (a) O desejo de felicidade é o grande motor da busca de meios para uma vida sempre melhor; (b) O ser humano estrutura a sua ideia de felicidade, vida, meios adequados, objectivos de graus diversos, em função dos conhecimentos de que disōpe. A 2 a meditação reconhece que a neutralidade de discurso da 1a meditação não teve éxito. As palavras são extremamente analógicas e pressupōem um «pensamento e discurso ocultos» , coniventes com o conceito de valor, que se pretendia evitar. O desejo de plenitude da qualidade de vida implica o acto, por vezes inconsciente, de valorização. /// The 1.st meditation aims to maintain a discourse independent of the concept of value. Like in an « Impossible mission», we face a project that easily forces the adventurer to return over his lost pathways in a desert. I. e., falling in a «petitio principii». The result of that l. st meditation could be synthesized as it follows: (a) The desire of hapiness is what forces us to search a better and better quality of life; (b) Human beings structure their idea of hapiness. life, adequate means to various kinds of objectives, according to their available knowledge. The 2. nd meditation recognizes the failure of the searched neutral discourse in the l. st meditation: its words and concepts exemplify a very deep analogy and reveal an occult system of thought and discourse, where the notion of value is unmistakably implicated. The desire of a quality of life in all its richness implies, although some times unconsciously, the act of evaluation.<br>

Abstract: Este artigo tem por tema a relação entre a Filosofia da História e a problemática epistemólogica da complexidade. A teoria do conhecimento histórico ou epistemologia da História nao pode ser vista de modo linear ou unívoco porque tem sofrido mutações nos seus quadros conceptuais compáraveis às revoluções cientificas concebidas pelo filosofo e historiador das ciências Thomas Kuhn, destacando-se quatro paradigmas (continuando a usar a terminologia deste autor) do conhecimento histórico: o paradigma "omnicompreensivo", que visa compreender o sentido global da História e tem como representante máximo Hegel, retomado no contexto actual por Francis Fukuyama com a sua tese sobre o tlm da Historia: o paradigma positivista guiado por uma ideia de objectividade do conhecimento histórico hoje considerada redutora: o relativismo emergente com o "fim das grandes narrativas de legitimação do saber" e a fragmentação do sentido no pensamento pós-modemo; e a "História aberta" ao misterio do tempo, problematizadora, que constrói o seu objecto na complexidade da relação interdisciplinar com outros saberes, limitada aos instrumentos conceptuais ou técnicos do historiador e excedendo qualquer sistema conceptual fechado mas mantendo uma inquietacao metodologica orientada pela busca interminável de sentido. É este último paradigma -epistemológico, hermenêutico e histórico - que é defendido neste estudo. /// This essay deals with the relation between the philosophy of history and the epistemological problem of complexity.

Abstract: A obra principal de Bernard Lonergan Inteligência: Um ensaio sobre o conhecimento humano, é um tratado que leva a cabo uma integração segundo o método transcendental dos conhecimentos heterogéneos da ciência, da filosofia, do senso comum e da teologia. A obra visa a auto-apropriação da nossa auto-consciência intelectual e racional com base na experiência consciente dos actos de intelecção. Começa como teoria cognitiva, expande-se para uma metafísica e uma ética, e avança para uma concepção e uma afirmação de Deus, para ser finalmente confrontada com o problema do mal que exige a transformação da inteligência auto-confiante no intellectus quaerens fidem. Ao cumprir estes objectivos, Inteligência tornou-se uma das mais importantes obras de filosofia do século XX, aqui sucintamente elucidada em cinco das suas principais vertentes: a relação entre conhecimento e realidade, conhecimento científico e cosmologia, a acção humana e a ética, as questões de interpretação, a relação entre natureza de Deus e filosofia. O artigo conclui com uma avaliação da cosmopolis lonerganiana, ou seja, o poder da comunidade de espírito na sociedade. /// Bernard Lonergan s opus magnum, Insight: A Study of human understanding, handles the heterogeneous fields of knowledge as given in science, philosophy, common sense and theology according to a transcendental method. The work aims at the self-appropriation of human intellectual and rational self-conscience as based in the conscious experience of insight. Lonergan s work starts as a cognitive theory, and advances, through metaphysics and ethics, to a conception and affirmation of God, one that is confronted with the problem of evil and therefore requires a transformation of self-confident intelligence into the intellectus quaerens fidem. Handling these goals, Insight became one of the most important works of philosophy in the 20 th century. The present article deals with five of the main issues in Lonergan s work: the relation between knowledge~<br>

Abstract: De part et d'autre de l'Atlantique, l'œuvre de Michel Foucault a été reçue de manière très différente par les anthropologues. Si l'anthropologie américaine a accueilli avec enthousiasme les réflexions du philosophe sur les rapports entre pouvoir et savoir, sur sa conceptualisations du biopolitique, les anthropologues français se sont montrés plus réticents et ont manifesté longtemps une certaine méfiance à l'égard de ce penseur. Chez Foucault luimême, on ne trouve que de rares références à l'anthropologie, et son point de vue sur l'anthropologie structurale est extrêmement critique. Cet article est centré sur la question du pouvoir, car c'est là que l'influence foucaldienne sur la nouvelle anthropologie est particulièrement manifeste, et il s'inscrit dans le cadre d'une interrogation plus large sur les rapports entre philosophie et anthropologie. /// On both sides of the Atlantic, anthropologists have received Michel Foucault's work quite differently. Whereas American anthropology has enthusiastically accepted the philosopher's thoughts about the relations between power and knowledge, and his conceptualization of "biopolitics", French anthropologists have, for a long time now, been more reluctant, even wary of this thinker. Foucault's work contains very few references to anthropology, and his point of view about structural anthropology was extremely critical. This article, which focuses on the question of power, where Foucault's influence on new trends in anthropology is especially evident, is part of a broader inquiry into the relations between philosophy and anthropology.<br>

Publisher: Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia<br>
Issue: i40019047<br>
Date: 9 1, 2007<br>
Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Publisher: El Colegio de México<br>
Issue: i40019118<br>
Date: 8 1, 2005<br>
Author(s): Murillo Lorena<br>
Abstract: El autor examina cinco equívocos comunes con respecto a la investigatión basada en estudios de caso: 1) el conocimiento teórico es más valioso que el conocimiento práctico; 2) no puede generalizarse a partir de un caso individual y, por tanto, los estudios de caso individuales no pueden contribuir al progreso cientifico; 3) los estudios de caso son más útiles para generar hipótesis, mientras que otros métodos son más apropiados para comprobar hipótesis y elaborar teorías; 4) los estudios de caso tienen un sesgo hacia la verificatión, y 5) a menudo resulta dificil sintetizar los estudios de caso específicos. Flyvbjerg explica y corrige cada uno de estos equívocos, concluyendo con el planteamiento kuhniano de que una disciplina científica carente de estudios de caso cuidadosamente realizados es una disciplina carente de una producción sistemática de ejemplares y, por lo tanto, inefícaz. La ciencia social podria fortalecerse mediante la realización de más y mejores estudios de caso. /// This article examines five common misunderstandings about case-study research: 1) theoretical knowledge is more valuable than practical knowledge; 2) one cannot generalize from a single case, therefore the single case study cannot contribute to scientific development; 3) the case study is most useful for generating hypotheses, while other methods are more suitable for hypotheses testing and theory building; 4) the case study contains a bias toward verification; and 5) it is often difficult to summarize specific case studies. The article explains and corrects these misunderstandings one by one and concludes with the Kuhnian insight that a scientific discipline without a large number of thoroughly executed case studies is a discipline without systematic production of exemplars, and that a discipline without exemplars is an ineffective one. Social science may be strengthened by the execution of more good case studies.<br>

Abstract: The intention of the article is to demonstrate the dialectical relation of self-understanding and understanding of the Other within ethnological interpretation. Proceeding from the conflict between the estimation of the reality of the Chachilla-Indians (formerly called Cayapa) on the part of a protestant missionary and the ethnologist, the whole ethnological enterprise turns out not to aim at "structures," "actions," or other "objects" but at the multiple forms of understanding with which it is confronted and of which itself is a part. Because of this hermeneutical orientation ethnological knowledge necessarily remains open for corrections and reinterpretations.<br>

Author(s): Rössler Martin<br>
Abstract: This paper examines the application of both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches to the analysis of specific cultural domains, in particular to the analysis of ritual. The data sources, referring to a most significant ritual in a rural Makassar community, are subdivided into three categories, namely various verbal statements, an indigenous written text describing form and contents of the ritual, and information resulting from participant observation during its actual performance. The argumentation shifts from a formal analysis of the ritual schema to a discussion of the question to what extent verbal statements as well as the written text have to be conceived of as indigenous interpretations of the local culture, which in turn are interpreted by the ethnographer. It is suggested that both cognitive and symbolic/interpretive approaches should complementary be referred to for a fruitful analysis of at least some domains of cultural knowledge.<br>

Author(s): ZahaviAbstract: A criticism of all totalizing knowledge, deconstruction rejects all appeals to ontological, epistemological or ethical absolutes as a metaphysics of presence. Like all postmodernist philosophies, it presents serious difficulties for traditional monotheistic theologies and their basic affirmations about the human subject. Some are apprehensive of the atheistic tendencies of deconstruction, but others have enthusiastically argued for the possibility of a theistic appropriation of postmodern themes and their hermeneutics of suspicion and finitude. This article provides an outline of the ethico-theroretical basis of deconstruction, and examines its ethical claims. Derrida's views on Islam as reflected in his discourse on hospitality are examined, and a critical evaluation of the ethical propositions of deconstruction from an Islamic perspective is presented.<br>

Author(s): Tornatore Jean-Louis<br>
Abstract: À partir de la scène de mise en patrimoine d'une machine sidérurgique, un haut fourneau de « l'ancienne » Lorraine industrielle, cet article propose une analyse des conditions d'émergence et de stabilisation d'une catégorie patrimoniale récente, le patrimoine industriel, autrement dit du traitement en monument des restes de la seconde industrialisation. La patrimonialisation de tels restes est tout entière déterminée par l'évaluation de leur « comportement » aux différentes étapes de la « chaîne patrimoniale » -connaissance/conservation/valorisation -qui instruit le monument historique.Pour autant ce processus contribue en retour à la mise en question de ce mode de traitement et à l'invention de nouvelles stratégies culturelles. A blast furnace in « formerly » industrialized Lorraine is being presented as a monument belonging to France's national heritage. The conditions are analyzed for the emergence and stabilization of a recent category for classifying what remains from the second wave of industrialization as part of this heritage. This process is fully determined by assessing the object's « behavior » during various stages (knowledge, conservation, treasuring) in the « patrimonial chain » leading to its classification as a historical monument. In feedback, this process leads us to raise questions about handling such sites in this way and inventing cultural strategies.<br>

Author(s): Kululuka Apollinaire Anakesa<br>
Abstract: Depuis la seconde moitié du xxe siècle, il s'opère un jeu de va-et-vient incessant entre le passé et le présent, entre la transcendance de la tradition ou sa rupture, en même temps qu'il se produit un phénomène d'échanges et de communications de diverses musiques du monde. De ce phénomène résultent aussi bien des chocs de culture, de savoirs que de pensées et de leur ré-interprétation ou transformation, sans oublier leur ré-appropriation par les uns et par les autres. Les musiques des uns et des autres -cultures du monde -, devenant alors le patrimoine de tous, se prêtent aux fantasmes et aux interprétations de ceux qui les reçoivent ou les perçoivent selon leur sensibilité, selon leurs affinités. C'est dans ce cadre que la musique elitiste contemporaine couvre actuellement une hétérogénéité de procédés et de formes, en ce qu'elle associe divers facteurs : écriture-oralité, mémoire collective, acquis culturel, juxtaposition ou enchevêtrement d'expressions musicales d'origines diverses (populaires, variétés, traditionnelles, savantes). Ceci appelle sa relecture à différents niveaux, par conséquent sa ré-interprétation, ainsi que l'examen approfondi de ses conditions historiques et socioculturelles de production. Pour amorcer cette nouvelle réflexion sur l'art musical elitiste contemporain, devenue actuellement plus qu'une nécessité, je propose l'expression World Music savante pour servir ici de béquille à une tentative de questionnement sur l'émergence et la consolidation d'une nouvelle identité culturelle ou tradition musicale elitiste contemporaine, celle cristallisant une réalité multiple et hétérogène. C'est aussi, pour moi, une manière de m'interroger sur la contemporanéité de la musique savante actuelle. Since the second half of the 20th century, there has been a ceaseless interplay between past and present, between transcendence of and break with tradition, together with a phenomenon of exchange and communication with diverse musics of the world, resulting in ~<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: Cet article traite du rapport de l'engagement et de la connaissance sociologique, en prenant pour terrain la problématique des rapports sociaux de sexe et le féminisme. Plus exactement, c'est la question de l'utopie et de sa fonction heuristique et cognitive éventuelle pour la recherche qui fait l'objet de l'étude. Après avoir rappelé et présenté certains des travaux les plus importants sur la question, il est procédé à une tentative d'élucidation des vertus cognitives de l'utopie féministe matérialiste pour les recherches sur le genre, la différence des sexes et la domination masculine. La conclusion revient sur les implications épistémologiques et méthodologiques de cette étude. This article is devoted to the study of the relationship between engagement and soaological knowledge, in the field of research relevant to gender and feminism. More exactly, the question concerns the heuristic and cognitive functions of utopia. Firstly, the author introduces some of the most significant works on the subject. Then, he tries to clarify the cognitive virtues of the feminist utopia for a better understanding of gender, sex difference and male domination. The conclusion reconsiders the epistemological and methodological implications of the study.<br>

Publisher: Presses Universitaires de France<br>

Author(s): Gonthier Frédéric<br>
Abstract: La notion wébérienne de « compréhension » ne se réduit pas à la continuité cognitive que réclament aujourd'hui les « sociologies compréhensives » entre connaissance ordinaire et connaissance scientifique. Elle s'élucide au contraire dans les notions qui appartiennent à son extension logique : le sens subjectivement visé, Vinterprétation rationnelle et l'explication causale. On analysera ici ces trois notions coextensives, de même que les différentes formes de circularité qu'elles entretiennent dans la sociologie wébérienne. Weber's notion of « understanding » cannot, as claimed by comprehensive sociologists, be understood simply as cognitive continuity between ordinary knowledge and scientific knowledge. Rather, it must be logically extended, taking into account subjective meaning, rational interpretation and causal explanation. The article analyzes these three coextensive notions, as well as the different forms of circularity they create in Weber's sociology.<br>

Abstract: Relationship, connection, and engagement have emerged as key values in recent studies of human-animal relations. In this article, I call for a reexaminaron of the productive aspects of detachment. I trace ethnographically the management of everyday relations between biologists and the Kalahari meerkats they study, and I follow the animals' transformation as subjects of knowledge and engagement when they become the stars of an internationally popular, televised animal soap opera. I argue that treating detachment and engagement as polar opposites is unhelpful both in this ethnographic case and, more broadly, in anthropological discussions of ethics and knowledge making.<br>

Publisher: Oxford University Press<br>
Issue: i40039166<br>

Author(s): Lee Sherry D.<br>
Abstract: Early twentieth-century Viennese modernity, obsessed with identity in crisis, was especially preoccupied with the play between external appearances and internal dimensions of the self. This is the context for Alexander Zemlinsky's opera Der £ werg, which stages the tragic tale of an ugly, misshapen individual who does not recognize his own mirror image. The fatal end to his encounter with his reflection speaks to the devastating consequences of the limits of self-knowledge. While multiple conceptions of recognition— ranging from self-identity to the need for acknowledgement by others— have become increasingly prominent in recent literary, philosophical, and political discourses, theories of recognition have rarely played a role in the interpretation of operatic works. Here, the engagement with Zemlinsky's opera, and the Oscar Wilde text on which it is based, is framed and informed by the multivalent concept of recognition, which illuminates both the thematic and the structural workings of the music and libretto, while reflecting productively on the wider personal and political dimensions of their cultural contexts.<br>

Author(s): Ricœur Paul<br>
Abstract: Cet article s'interroge sur le statut à la fois épistémologique et ontologique d'un passé qui « a été » et dont les individus comme les sociétés retiennent le souvenir, mais qui, comme le langage ordinaire l'exprime, « n'est plus » . Toute une tradition de réflexion sur la conservation du passé par la mémoire depuis Platon et Aristote a voulu ramener la mémoire à la métaphore de l'empreinte. En revanche, cet article tente de montrer que la mémoire à plusieurs dont dépend la connaissance historique n'est pas simplement assimilable à ce topos traditionnel. Ce qui caractérise la mémoire plurielle et publique qui alimente le travail de l'historien, c'est le statut privilégié du témoignage, la possibilité de confronter différents témoignages les uns aux autres, dont dépend la crédibilité du récit historique. C'est ainsi moins la problématique d'une ressemblance entre récit et événements racontés — problématique de la trace, héritée d'une tendance traditionnelle à identifier la mémoire avec l'empreinte — que la confrontation de témoignages dans leurs différents degrés de fiabilité qui nous fait assister à l'événement raconté. Cette réflexion sur le décalage entre mémoire et histoire ouvre, dans la deuxième partie de cet article, à une analyse approfondie de la temporalité propre au passé qui fait l'objet du souvenir et conduit à une confrontation avec privilège accordé, dans la synthèse des trois modes du temps, chez saint Augustin au présent et, chez Heidegger, au futur. De cette manière, l'article tente de rééquilibrer la synthèse des temps en lui restituant un autre rapport au passé, que l'on ne saurait atteindre à partir d'Augustin ou de Heidegger. Libérer l'histoire du paradigme de la trace, de la métaphore de la mémoire comme empreinte, revient précisément à la restitution de ce mode de temporalisation du passé jusqu'ici esquivé : cet autre rapport au passé vise, conjointement à la mise en évidence du témoignage propre au travail de l'historien, à souligner la dette~<br>

Abstract: Depuis un demi-siècle d'importantes mutations sont intervenues dans l'exercice du métier d'historien, dues notamment à la pression d'une demande sociale forte, à une médiatisation galopante dans la communication du savoir, à la nécessité de procéder à l'historisation d'une mémoire déferlante. Mais deux pièges épistémologiques guettent : d'un côté, le retour d'une forme de positivisme appauvrissant et simplificateur ; de l'autre, l'abolition, sous l'influence des thèses postmodernistes, de la ligne de partage entre histoire et fiction. Si l'on veut fonder solidement et rationnellement la responsabilité, scientifique, sociale et morale, de l'historien, sans retomber dans une approche moralisante ni verser dans une neutralité abstraite et sans vie, il convient, d'abord, de rappeler en permanence que la première mission de l'historien est une mission de vérité, en second lieu de marquer avec force qu'il existe un lien congénital entre histoire et valeurs. The transformations in the practice of the historian's craft, which are a definite feature of our times, proceed, among other causes, from the pressure of social demand, from the new role taken by the medias in the communications of knowledge, from the need of historicizing critically memory. Today two pitfalls are threatening : on the one hand, a return to a positivist brand, devoid of understanding and meaning ; on the other hand, under the impact of postmodernist theories, the deletion of the dividing line between history and fiction. In order to provide a sound and rationally established basis to the idea of a scientific, social and moral responsibility of the historian, without falling back either into a moralizing approach or an abstract and lifeless neutrality, two conditions are required : first, to recall ceaselessly that in history truth is and remains the first goal ; secondly to stress that a congenital connection unites history with values.<br>

Abstract: Cet article commente la parution, en 1996, d'un ouvrage édité par la Maison des sciences de l'homme sous la direction de Daniel Fabre : L'Europe entre cultures et nations. Confrontés à une prolifération des études qui se réclament aujourd'hui d'une « ethnologie de l'Europe », les auteurs (qui furent au préalable réunis en colloque à Tours en 1993) s'efforcent d'accomplir une mission limite : consolider les bornes d'un savoir labélisé en exerçant leur puissance de discernement sur les études mises en confrontation. En est-ce ou n'en est-ce pas ? Telle serait, ici, la question. This article comments the publication in 1996 of the book Europe between cultures and nations edited by Daniel Fabre. Confronted today with a proliferation of studies claiming they are concerned with "European ethnology" the authors (who met previously at the Conference in Tours in 1993) try to accomplish a mission : confirm the limits of a labelled knowledge by exerting their capacity of discrimination between the studies confronted. Dieser Artikel kommentiert das Buch Europa zwischen Kulturen und Nationen, das unter der Leitung von Daniel Fabre in 1996 veröffentlicht wurde. Konfrontiert mit der schnellen Zunahme von Studien, die sich heute auf Europäische Ethnologie berufen, versuchen die Autoren (die in 1993 an der Konferenz in Tours zusammentrafen) eine Mission zu erfüllen : die Grenzen eines labellierten Wissens zu sichern, indem sie ihr Unterscheidungsvermögen auf die verschiedenen Studien ausüben.<br>

Author(s): Schnell Izhak<br>
Abstract: Within the last 2000 years the land demarcated by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan Valley to the east has been one of the most disputed territories in history. World powers have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabit.The struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1967, Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.<br>

Two main trends of Jean Piage's work are most important for those concerned with episthemological research — mamely his studies on the evolution of human intelligence (his scientific psychological practice) and his analysis on general conditions for scientific knowledge.

Abstract: A educaçao é vulgarmente considerada um importante instrumento impulsionador da transformacäo social. Alias, segundo a teoría liberal, a educaçao foi sempre considerada urna via para a mobilidade social e a chave do progresso individual e social. Todavía, foi nos anos 60 que a educaçao começou a atrair as atençôes dos economistas, dos políticos, dos organismos internacionais e dos movimentos revolucionarios. Com efeito, tiveram lugar certos acontecimentos que levaram a olhar mais de perto os processus e as instituiçôes educacionais. A elaboraçâo de teorías económicas da educaçao constituí um indicativo deste descente interesse pela educaçao e pelo saber. A concepçâo económica do « capital humano » contém, porém, pressupostos ideológicos que reforçam o modelo capitalista da sociedade. De qualquer modo, a educaçao, em termos de descimentó económico e mobilidade social, foi posta em evidencia em todos os países capitalistas desenvolvidos. Nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, a crescente industrializaçâo também salientou o papel da educaçao na mudança social. Mas, além dos problemas do desenvolvimento capitalista nos países desenvolvidos e da industrializaçâo nos países capitalistas subdesenvolvidos, os anos 60 e os principios dos anos 70 proporcionaran! outras razöes para destacar a importancia da educaçao nas mudanças sociais. Designadamente, as reformas educacionais socialistas em Cuba, na China e, mais recentemente, em diversos países africanos constitiiem inspiraçao para novos e importantes estudos. Na revoluçâo socialista há a consciência de que a luta das classes também se manifesta nas escolas. Por outro lado, as teorías de confuto, marxistas e näo marxistas, também se aplicam à análise das reformas educacionais nas sociedades capitalistas. Estas teorías tentam estabelecer as bases para uma sociedade alternativa, baseada no valor do trabalho. Efectivamente, um projecto de mudanças educacionais como parte integrante de um processo de revoluçâo cultural deriv~<br>

Abstract: Quatre recueils récents comportant des contributions de philosophes allemands et américains permettent de préciser et discuter les grandes questions soulevées aujourd'hui par diverses traditions de lecture de Hegel, en particulier, la question d'une lecture morale de la « reconnaissance » dans la Phénoménologie de l'esprit, la théorie de la connaissance, le statut de la beauté. Four recent collections offering contributions by German and American philoso­phers allow us to discuss with greater precision the major questions raised today by different traditions of reading Hegel, notably in regard to the question of a moral reading of the concept of "recognition" in the Phenomenology of the mind, the theory of knowledge, the status of beauty.<br>

Abstract: Le discours de la recherche sur les enseignants et leurs savoirs est souvent tenté de détacher la connaissance du sujet connaissant, traduisant des préoccupations de fonctionnalité et de transférabilité des savoirs. À cette perspective rationaliste résiste néanmoins une mouvance de recherche qui défend une approche anthropologique du savoir enseignant, moins soucieuse de légiférer l'acte d'enseignement que de mettre au jour les formes complexes et locales de construction de l'enseignant-sujet et de ses savoirs, que ceux-ci soient inscrits dans une forme de vie, incarnés, ou dessinés réflexivement dans l'espace narratif. Ce courant phénoménologique et herméneutique, pluriel et très vivace dans le monde anglo-saxon, promeut le savoir ordinaire des enseignants, se démarquant ainsi des études attentives aux seuls savoirs ' extraordinaires' de l'expert. Traduisant un retour du sujet qui traverse les sciences sociales depuis la dernière décennie, cette tendance dans la recherche éducative à réhabiliter la subjectivité enseignante, sans pour autant la magnifier, adresse des questions importantes à notre champ de recherche sur les choix épistémologiques qui le guident. Research discourse on teachers and their knowledge has a tendency to separate knowledge from the one who knows as it is focusing on knowledge functionality and transfer. Nevertheless, one research movement is resisting to this rationalist perspective, preferring an anthropological approach of teachers' knowledge focusing on sophisticated and local forms of construction of knowledge and knowing subject rather than on teaching laws (these constructions being embodied or reflexively designed in narrative space). This multifaceted phenomenological and hermeneutic trend, observed in anglosaxon world, is promoting teachers' ordinary knowledge, when the majority of investigations focus only on expert knowledge. As it can be observed in all social sciences in this last decade, the importance of the subject - the teac~<br>

Abstract: Depuis que la didactique du français s'est constituée comme champ de recherche, la question de l'enseignement de la littérature a toujours été centrale, même si l'approche didactique de la littérature apparaît davantage comme un espace de questions que comme un lieu de construction d'une théorie cohérente de la littérature, de son enseignement et de son apprentissage. Concernant l'enseignement de la littérature, la didactique du français est essentiellement un champ de discussions théoriques, qui portent aussi bien sur le statut des objets enseignables et sur les conditions de leur enseignabilité que sur la sélection des outils théoriques permettant l'approche de ces objets. Si, aux fondements de la didactique de la littérature, c'est la contestation de l'enseignement traditionnel qui domine, sur des postulats théoriques à forte teneur idéologique, de nombreuses recherches descriptives ont interrogé aussi bien la notion de littérature que les pratiques de lecture des élèves comme les pratiques effectives d'enseignement de la littérature. Au cœur des recherches didactiques se place la question de la sélection des savoirs et des pratiques (lecture et écriture notamment) susceptibles de devenir objets d'enseignement et d'apprentissage, à tous les niveaux du cursus scolaire. Since the didactics of French formed a research field, the question of teaching literature has constantly been crucial, even if the didactical approach of literature seems more like a forum to ask questions, rather than a place where a coherent theory on literature, its teaching and learning is being developed. As for teaching literature, the didactics of French is mainly an area of theoretical discussion as much about the status of objects to be taught and the conditions on which they can be taught as how to select theoretical tools to approach those objects. If, of all the founding elements of didactics of literature, objecting to traditional teaching is the main element based on theoretical postu~<br>

Abstract: Cette note de synthèse souligne la spécificité de la discipline enseignée. L'histoire scolaire occupe une position originale dans le champ des didactiques par la complexité de ses références (production savante, auto-référence scolaire et usages publics de l'histoire). Tendus entre une transmission de connaissances consensuelles et la recherche d'une posture critique, les objets d'histoire enseignés demeurent soumis à des questionnements renouvelés au gré de la demande sociale comme le montrent les récents débats autour des questions mémorielles vives et concurrentes. L'histoire enseignée apparaît ainsi comme un mixte articulant représentations sociales, savoirs privés et connaissances validées. Depuis une quinzaine d'années, des travaux ont permis de mieux cerner le « penser en histoire » et les processus cognitifs spécifiques en jeu dans la classe (temps historique, conceptualisation, problématisation, construction de schemes explicatifs). Des recherches contextualisées ont permis d'explorer les pratiques professionnelles effectives et d'en modéliser le fonctionnement « normal » : une discipline qui privilégie la transmission de savoirs disant la réalité du passé et attachée à la neutralité du texte enseigné ; une discipline qui peine à mettre en cohérence des finalités intellectuelles ambitieuses (outiller le citoyen actif dans la cité de demain) et des activités dans la classe souvent cantonnées à la mémorisation, au repérage et à la catégorisation. Aussi voit-on se dessiner dans les travaux actuels, une problématique centrée sur les écarts entre les intentions et les pratiques. En articulant la notion de soumission aux règles du « contrat didactique » avec les autres modèles théoriques des sciences humaines et sociales mobilisés au sein des équipes de recherche, les travaux menés de manière encore trop dispersée, laissent apparaître des acquis importants qui pourraient être pris en compte dans la formation des enseignants This paper underlines the specificity o~<br>

Abstract: Throughoput its history, "ideology" (the concept and theory) served as social science's foil, an opposing standard against which it defined its own knowledge-as-truth. As social science since mid-century has undergone changes in its idea of itself and its methods of inquiry, the theory of ideology has served as register, visably recording these changes. Works by the structuralists and poststructuralists, especially Althusser and Foucault, forced upon social theorists a profound rethinking of power and its operations and moved "ideology" away from the theory of false consciousness towards a view of ideology as cultural practice. For some, ideology theory is obsolete (due to its classical roots as "false consciousness") or redundant (due to its links to "culture"). Despite the merits of these arguments, a provisional argument on behalf of ideology theory is offered.<br>

Abstract: This article analyzes the strategies by which the narrator of Caesar's Bellum Civile constructs his authority and promotes his version of the civil war. Despite being generally omnipresent, omniscient and un-intrusive, the narrator can abandon his covert position and all-encompassing knowledge and use multiple devices to guide the readers' perception of salient events. Switches of focalization, inferred motivation, presentation through negation and intratextual echoes color the narrative of key episodes, such as the negotiations of peace with Pompey in Book 1 and the descriptions of the battles at Dyrrachium and Pharsalus.<br>

Date: 2 1, 1991<br>
Author(s): ZizekAbstract: Arguing that without a differentiated and relational notion of the cultural, the social sciences would he crippled, reducing social action to notions of pure instrumentality, in this article, I trace the growth of cultural analysis from the beginnings of modern anthropology to the present as a layered set of experimental systems whose differential lenses create epistemic objects with increasing precision and differential focus and resolution. Arguing that culture is not a variable-culture is relational, it is elsewhere or in passage, it is where meaning is woven and renewed, often through gaps and silences, and forces beyond the conscious control of individuals, and yet the space where individual and institutional social responsibility and ethical struggle take place-I name culture as a set of central anthropological forms of knowledge grounding human beings' self-understandings. The challenge of cultural analysis is to develop translation and mediation tools for helping make visible the differences of interests, access, power, needs, desires, and philosophical perspective. In particular, as we begin to face new kinds of ethical dilemmas stemming from developments in biotechnologies, expansive information and image databases, and ecological interactions, we are challenged to develop differentiated cultural analyses that can help articulate new social institutions for an evolving civil society.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry-based teacher education promotes an exploration of concrete particulars as the route to wise practice. The case study presented illustrates one teacher candidate's struggle to let go of a conception of knowledge as generalizable formulae that can be readily applied in practice and to become more open to practice itself as a site of learning. Teacher educators can nurture such openness by helping aspiring teachers to appreciate the fragility of knowledge, the epistemological value of feeling, and the priority of the particular, in teaching. In so doing, educators recover practical wisdom as the beginning and end-in-view of teacher education. /// La formation à l'enseignement axée sur la recherche favorise la prise en compte des conditions particulières et, de ce fait, une pratique éclairée. L'étude de cas présentée dans cet article illustre les efforts d'une candidate à l'enseignement en vue de se départir d'une conception de la connaissance définie comme une formule généralisable, facilement applicable dans la pratique, et de mieux accueillir la pratique elle-même comme un lieu d'apprentissage. Les responsables de la formation à l'enseignement peuvent contribuer à cette ouverture en aidant les futurs enseignants à saisir la fragilité de la connaissance, la valeur épistémologique des sentiments et l'importance des conditions particulières dans l'enseignement. Ce faisant, les éducateurs redécouvrent la sagesse comme le début et l'objectif à atteindre dans la formation à l'enseignement.<br>

Abstract: En la primera parte de este texto su autor discute algunos aspectos de la propuesta de Lucien Jaume (véase el resumen del artículo anterior), centrándose especialmente en la distinción entre «conceptos filosóficos» y «conceptos políticos», una dicotomía que le parece difícilmente sostenible, en la medida en que considera inaceptable toda «semántica trascendental» al margen de la historia. Más adelante, se propone una reflexión sobre el uso de los conceptos y discursos en el debate político, enfatizando su contingencia y contestabilidad constitutivas, y, en consecuencia, la imposibilidad de fijar cualquier clase de definición aséptica y normativa de los mismos (ni siquiera por parte de los autores históricos que se sirven de tales recursos argumentativos). Por último, apoyándose —entre otros— en la obra de Koselleck y Gadamer, efectúa el autor una serie de consideraciones críticas acerca de la arrogancia presentista de un sector de la historiografía, para terminar subrayando la radical historicidad de todo conocimiento (incluyendo nuestras propias interpretaciones históricas). In the first part of this text, the author discusses some aspects of Lucien Jaume's proposal (see the abstract of the previous article), focussing especially on the distinction between «philosophical concepts» and «political concepts», a dichotomy that to him seems hardly sustainable. Furthermore, a reflection is proposed on the use of the concepts and discourses in the political debate, emphasizing its constitutive contingency and contestability, and, in consequence, the inability to fix any class of aseptic and normative definition of them (not even by of the historical actors who used such arguments). Finally, resting -between others— on the work of Koselleck and Gadamer, the author carries out a series of critical considerations about the «arrogance presentist» of a sector of the historiography, to end up by underlining the radical historicity of all knowledge (including our own historical ~<br>

Abstract: El artículo pretende responder a alguno de los interrogantes abiertos en la historiografía internacional ante una actualidad saturada de memoria y las implicaciones político-sociales derivadas del «uso público de la historia». Desde esta perspectiva, se rastrean los conceptos utilizados para explicar el tratamiento propiamente histórico de los problemas, subrayar las polémicas esenciales y derivarlas hacia el espacio público en el que se celebran las ceremonias de la consagración memorial. El artículo continúa con una rápida visión panorámica del desarrollo de la historiografía contemporánea en las últimas décadas del siglo xx, distinguiendo tres grandes espacios/momentos de convergencia y enfrentamiento de la memoria con la práctica historiográfica. Y termina con una afirmación acerca de la posición del historiador, de su condición histórica y sus implicaciones con el mundo vertiginoso del presente donde la memoria y el olvido aparecen como dos puntos de referencia irrenunciables para el conocimiento de la historia contemporánea. The article pretends to give an answer to some of the open questions in the international historiography: a present time overloaded with memory and the social and political implications derived from the «public use of history». The concepts used to explain the historic treatment proper are investigated from that perspective; the essential polemics are underlined and directed towards the public space in which the ceremonies of the memorial consecration are celebrated. The article continues with a fast panoramic vision of the development of contemporary historiography in the last decades of the XXth century following three important moments / spaces of confrontation of the memory with the historiographie practice. It ends dealing with the position of the historian, his historical condition and his implication in the rapid world of the present where memory and oblivion appear as two unrenounceable reference points for the knowledge of the con~<br>

Abstract: This article is about the influence of the work of the German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) on English-speaking anthropologists. Although Weber does not figure prominently in the history of anthropology, his work has, nonetheless, had a profound influence on anthropological methodology and theoretical thinking on the relationship between religion and political economy. The "interpretive anthropology" first developed by Geertz has roots in Weber's "interpretive sociology." Bourdieu's "theory of practice" is also strongly Weberian in character. The anthropological study of religion, and particularly the debate over the foundations of this field between Geertz and Asad, is reconsidered in light of Weber's sociology of religion. His comparative study of the ethics of the world's religions and particularly the "Weber thesis" about the relationship between religion and the development of bourgeois capitalism are shown to have been the foundation for a large body of anthropological research on religion and political economy in societies in which the major world religions have been long established. The essay ends with a suggestion that Weber's work on politics and meaning merits reexamination in light of contemporary anthropological interest, derived from Foucault, in power and knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Casler Kenneth<br>
Abstract: By deliberately placing ethics under the category of communication, Kierkegaard intended to show that it is like no other science. He distinguished between direct communication and indirect communication. Direct communication concerns objectivity and knowledge; indirect communication, on the other hand, has to do with subjectivity ("becoming-subject"). In this paper, the author presents Kierkegaard's philosophy of communication and ethics with special emphasis on his irony and pseudonymous authorship. He also examines the possibility of a discourse in business ethics, focusing on the educational perspective. He discusses Kierkegaard's aspects of communication—the communicator, the receiver, and the object—with particular reference to applied ethics. He argues that the Kierkegaardian notion of indirect communication can contribute to renewing business ethics teaching—which in his view is more art than science—in two important ways: (1) when the ethics teacher changes his position in the teacher/learner relationship; and (2) when the relationship between communicator/receiver is strengthened at the expense of the object.<br>

Abstract: Internet suscite beaucoup d'espoirs et de craintes. Certains prétendent que cet outil sera favorable à l'émergence de sociétés de la connaissance à condition de réduire préalablement la fracture numérique et cognitive. Cet article prend prétexte de cette idée pour évaluer quels sont les réels rapports de force qui se jouent entre croyances et connaissances sur la toile. Il montre, d'une part, que l'amplification de la diffusion de l'information est favorable à l'expression du biais de confirmation qui est un des mécanismes fondamentaux de la pérennité des croyances. Il souligne, d'autre part, qu'Internet est un marché cognitif très sensible à la structuration de l'offre et donc à la motivation des offreurs, ce qui confère un avantage décisif à l'empire des croyances contre celui de la connaissance. Ce dernier point est mesuré dans cet article de façon quantitative sur des thèmes de croyances diverses. The Internet is the source of many hopes and fears. Some claim that this tool will help lead to the emergence of knowledge societies if digital and cognitive gaps can be reduced beforehand. This article takes that idea as a basis to then evaluate what are the real power relations played out between beliefs and knowledge on the web. It shows that the amplification of the dissemination of information is conducive to the expression of "confirmation bias" which is one of the mechanisms which permit beliefs to survive. It also stresses that Internet is a cognitive market which is very sensitive to structuring of supply and therefore the motivation of suppliers, which confers a decisive advantage to the "empire of beliefs". This last point is measured quantitatively in this paper on various topics of belief.<br>

Publisher: Springer<br>
Issue: i40072033<br>
Date: 4 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): Keller Reiner<br>
Abstract: The article presents the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse (SKAD). SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).<br>

Date: 10 1, 2011<br>
Author(s): PURI MICHAEL J.<br>
Abstract: When conceived as the presence of the past, memory can be said to pervade the music of Maurice Ravel. The number and range of these acts of musical memory -including illeces modelled on the medieval ballade, the Renaissance chanson, the Baroque tombeau, the Classical sonatine and the Romantic poème, among others -seem at first glance to testify to a uncomplicated relation between past and present which, upon closer review, is revealed to be problematic. One of the most complex and captivating artistic testaments to what Andreas Huyssen has called 'twilight memory' -not only in Ravel's music, but in Western modernism as a whole - is the eighth and final waltz of his illano suite Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911). In this waltz, which Ravel entitled 'Éilllogue', the hope of making the past present is reborn with each of its numerous thematic recollections, only to be dashed repeatedly by the melancholy knowledge of its impossibility. In the present study, affinities between the Éilllogue's musical behaviours and philosophical accounts of memory by Bergson, Jankélévitch and Nora are explored, along with the compositional precedents established by Beethoven, Schumann, Debussy and others.<br>

Abstract: Cognitive semantics postulates that specific mental mechanisms belonging to the human imagination, namely metaphorical and metonymical mappings, are involved in semantic changes. Nevertheless, a thorough examination reveals the weakness of this theory. I therefore advocate a radically different analysis which allows us to do without these postulated cognitive mechanisms. Systematizing Meillet's observations about the role of « discontinuity in transmission » in semantic change, I propose, for each case studied, to look for what circumstances in collective experience can make the discrepancy between the new and the former meaning imperceptible to the speakers themselves. I argue that a semantic change at its decisive moment must most often perform in a covert way, without its instigators' knowledge. The efficiency and heuristic fruitfulness of this method is illustrated in this paper by the study of certain Latin polysemous words expressing not only a physical bond but also a juridical obligation (obligare, obligatio, nectere, obstringere, solvere, absolvere).<br>

Author(s): Simonett Helena<br>
Abstract: Although today much of the Mayo-Yoreme sacred myths and their inherent symbolism is rather esoteric knowledge, known to a few only, the community's performance of the responso (ritual of honoring the dead) is important for the re-establishment of relationships between humans and the supernatural beings and between living persons and the ancestors. The communal experience of the responso and the sense of beingenjoined are characteristic of the spiritual experience and fundamental to the musical experience as well Since life/death of any individual is an experience tied to other individuals, I argue that a philosophical inquiry of selfhood—of both the individual and the community—may help us reason about and make possible an understanding of the responso.<br>

Abstract: The paper proposes a symptomatic reading of the writings of a fifteenth century heretical movement—the Dekike Estifanos—to throw light on the modernization predicament of twenty–first century Ethiopia. Based on the assumption that all serious thinking about a society needs to be mediated by its intellectual tradition, the paper enucleates critiques of power, institutions and knowledge that are immanent in the teachings of the Dekike Estifanos and that throw a new light on how Ethiopians could approach the tasks they face in the twenty-first century. It shows that such a critical dialogue with Ethiopia's intellectual traditions discloses questions, ideas and ideals that could provide historically-rooted intellectual resources for developing an Ethiopian critical theory capable of illuminating the possible routes to a modernization productive of freedom, equality, justice, and prosperity.<br>

Date: 1 1, 2012<br>
Author(s): Mennasemay Maimire<br>
Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Abstract: Ensaio expositivo e interpretativo das perguntas sobre a natureza humana e das respostas que o pensamento moderno, em Merlin Donald e outros, vai dando. A perspetiva fisicalista, neurobiológica, é analisada a partir de Joseph LeDoux, e outros, comentando as suas teses principáis. É dada ênfase particular à evolução das capacidades da mente humana na transiçao da cultura mimética para a cultura oral, a criaçao mítica e o advento da escrita e das outras formas de cultura exterior simbólica. Na crítica ao monismo fisicalista é discutido o que se pode entender por qualia e de que modo este entendimento justifica a aceitação de um "hiato explicativo" como o pensam Urbano Sidoncha e outros autores. É abordada a relaçao entre Pensamento e Linguagem a partir de Lev Vygotsky. Considerando a ética como um qualia procura-se fixar, empíricamente, a diferença entre ética e eticidade como contraponto à diferença entre autoconsciência e consciência cognitiva. Como proposta final é apresentada uma pergunta radical e oferecida urna temeraria resposta sobre o possível conhecimento total da natureza humana. Expository and interpretive essay of the questions on human nature and the responses that modern thought, in Merlin Donald et al., has been producing. The physicalist, neurobiological perspective is analysed as from Joseph LeDoux et al., by commenting on his main theses. Particular emphasis is given to the evolution of the human mind's capacities in the transition from the mimetic culture to the oral culture, the mythical creation and the advent of writing and the other forms of external symbolic culture. In the critique of the physicalist monism, one discusses what can be understood by qualia and how this understanding justifies the acceptance of an 'explanatory hiatus' such as Urbano Sidoncha and other authors think. The relationship between Thought and Language, as from Lev Vygotsky, is addressed. Considering ethics as a qualia, one tries to establish, in an empirical way, the d~<br>

Abstract: The article is intended to indicate how the study of written and cultural texts may be used to approach the problem of identifying the system of thought characteristic of particular groups. Certain premises of what may be called an “interpretative paradigm” have been selected to create a theoretical starting-point, and in this context the most suggestive appear to be the concept of culture developed by symbolic anthropology, the cultural-semiotic concept of text and the multi-dimensional hermeneutic approach to textual intepretation. The author therefore seeks to bring together, in addition to the general features ofinterpetative ethnology, certain theoretical and methodological starting-points derived from the three approaches mentioned. One may approach the problem of understanding of a foreign testimony via “adequate interpretation”. Here, to understand means to adopt the cultural “language” of a message as one's own, and to interpret and so transfer the unknown into an accessible code, most often one's own code. The process of interpretation is understood as the discovery of the hidden content behind the apparent stirface, and in this activity the understanding of culturally remote testimony is axiomatically taken to bepossible and communicable. In a broader epistemological context we can see in adequate intepretation one of the means to the never-ending process of correction of our pre-judged knowledge. In a spirit of critical rationalism we could deflne such interpretation as the working hypothesis that may be falsified by further Scientific activity and then replaced by a better theory. Such conclusions on the methodological range of the interpretative approach indicate only one of the possible syntheses of various epistemological paradigms, for the theoretical use and application of which ethnology seems especially suited.<br>

Abstract: Re-reading Plato’s Ion as the first text in the hermeneutics tradition, the author finds two main streams. The first, based on reflection (rationality, logic, knowledge) stems from ocrates; the second, consisting in an affective approach (myth, art), stems from Ion. Both Socrates and Ion delimit this field of hermeneutics (legein peri or ‘speaking abouť) staying beyond its frontiers. Next, the author exploits the Socrates: Ion binary in order to interpret some key figures, trends, and schools within the whole tradition (rabbis, St Augustine, Pietism, Schleiermacher, Nietzsche, Dilthey, explication de texte, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peter Szondi, the Nitra School, and Ricoeur). Writers tend towards either the Socratic (explication de texte) or lonic wing (Nietzsche). There are, however, also writers who attempted to find the middle ground, a position offering both reflexion and intuition (Schleiermacher, Gadamer, and Ricoeur). The author concludes that the main challenge issuing from his interpretation is to remain close to a text, and resist any temptation to go beyond it.<br>

Abstract: The critical work of F. X. Šalda is from its beginnings full of the pathos of the arrival of the new poetry. The vision, comporting entirely with the principies of symbolisim, is characterized as the idea of synthesis of knowledge: ‘to abstract the Eternal, Unified, and Absolute from the secondary, accidental, relative, temporally and spatially limited, and the divided'. The analytical spirit of science and scholarship, and also of art, aroused a general scepticism and a need for a turnaround. It brought the knowledge that synthesis is the essence of art. It is from there, that Šalda derived his principies of criticism. Analysis, he argued, is justified to the extent that it is governed by a total view. The dark centre of art is accessible to criticism only at the price of criticism itself becoming art, and its essential instrument is intuition. The actual work of the critic begins when the he no longer knows where to go. He must rise above the insignificance of mere facts and look at the world from his own point of view. His work is complementary to the work of the artist, and the nature of art means that self-identification is the lot of the critic. Art cannot be explained causually; the connection between what is near and the suspected contexts, that is to say insight into the mystery of meaning, is the prerequisite of aesthetic contemplation. The author is not bound by objectivity towards the perceived world; the reader is not bound by the objectivity of the author's perceived world, is not limited by the author's intentions. The very action of synthesis is a dynamic reference and another possibility of being. The project of synthesism is a vision of thorough, concrete symbolism; both the expansion of consciousness and the indivisibility of the individual from the rest of the world are included in this postulated unity.<br>

Abstract: In recent times, under the influence of postmodernist thought sociology has largely rejected the idea of social evolution. An exception to this trend is to be found in the work of Jürgen Habermas. Habermas's account of social evolution has received some critical attention, but in sociology wider detail of the picture is not well known. Habermas wishes to hold to the possibility that evolutionary progress can be discerned not only in the sphere of technical control, but also in the sphere of social and moral development. The paper presents Habermas's views on social evoluton within the wider context of his development of critical theory as a 'reconstructive science'. It suggests that his account has been able to resist many of the standard criticisms of evolutionary theory and that a renewal of interest in this area could provide a rich vein of new sociological knowledge.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Author(s): Corradi Consuelo<br>
Abstract: A lively concern for new instruments of knowledge has led sociology, among other disciplines, to collect life stories in order to explore social phenomena. Dialogue and interpersonal communication thus become crucial tools, as well as loci of knowledge. This paper investigates the epistemological suppositions of 'the biographical approach': the quest for identity in the narrative, the dialogical relationship between the narrating self and the researcher, the fixation of speech into text and more. The overall effort of the investigation is to reach criteria of analysis which are not simply borrowed from other areas, but are the outcome of reflection upon the constituent features of life stories. This investigation, however, does not widen the gap between 'qualitative' and 'quantitative' sociology, but rather it contributes to put this division into question.<br>

Abstract: Les frontispices des livres de médailles publiés entre la fin du XVIe et le milieu du XVIIIe siècle résument les conceptions et les intentions des numismates, manifestant l'ancien statut de la « science des médailles », non point science auxiliaire, mais quasi égale de l'histoire. Ils font d'abord l'éloge des médailles elles-mêmes, source de connaissance et divertissement : de là ces scènes de théâtre, ces arcs de triomphe, ces guirlandes, ces festons où monnaies et médaillons tiennent une large place. Les allégories de Clio et de Chronos, voisinant avec des monnaies sorties de terre, illustrent le lien entre la numismatique et l'histoire ; mais elles désignent aussi les médailles comme des parcelles d'éternité, échappées à la fuite du temps, objets offerts à la vénération autant qu'à l'étude. L'allégorie de Rome témoigne enfin à quelle époque vont les préférences de numismates tout imprégnés de culture classique : la monnaie de la Rome impériale est pour eux la médaille par excellence et préfigure celles du roi-soleil. Die Frontispizen der zwischen dem ausgehenden 16. Jh. und der Mitte des 18. Jh.s veröffentlichten Münzbücher spiegeln die Grundhaltung der Numismaten wider, für die althergebrachte 'Münzkunde' keine Hilfswissenschaft darstellt, sondern eine eigene Disziplin mit gleicher Dignität wie die Historie. Die Münzen werden als Quelle von Kenntnis und Zerstreuung gefeiert : In Theaterszenen, Triumphbögen, Girlanden und bei Festen werden Münzen und Medaillen an prominenter Stellen eingeführt. Die Allegorien von Clio und Chronos neben Münzen, die aus der Erde heraufsteigen, verbildlichen die Verbindung zwischen Numismatik und Geschichte ; zugleich weisen sie den Medaillen Ewigkeitswert zu : Als Wertstücken, die dem Lauf der Zeit entzogen und der Verehrung wie dem Studium anheimgestellt sind. Die Allegorie von Rom bezeugt schließlich die Hinwendung der Numismatiker zur Schlüsselepoche der für sie alles beherrschenden klassischen Kultur : Die Münzen des römischen ~<br>

Abstract: Voulant résoudre l'énigme de la connaissance, Husserl est aux prises, dans Expérience et Jugement, avec la genèse transcendantale des formes predicatives. Celles-ci renvoient à la structure de l'expérience sensible dans sa double dimension : passive et active. C'est activement que le sujet percevant saisit et « détaille » un objet perçu en ses moments déterminants (ex.« une boule sphérique et rouge »). Au cours de l'expérience sensible se constituent des « types » qui rendent possible la reconnaissance d'un objet sous telle ou telle catégorie. Sur ce trajet, non exempt de seuils à franchir, qui va du « sens » perçu à la signification langagière, nous essayons de montrer quelle place pourrait être assignée à la nomination dans une perspective husserlienne. In his attempt to resolve the enigma of knowledge, in Experience and Judgement Husserl undertakes the task of describing the transcendantal genesis of the predicative forms. These forms refer back to the structures of receptivity with its two dimensions, passive and active. The perceiver actively grasps and « details » the perceived object in its determining moments (parts or qualities : « spherical », « red » ...). Throughout sensible experience « types » and « typical structures » are constituted, which make possible the recognition of an objet under this or that category. On the way, not without crossing certain thresholds, going from the perceived « sense » to the linguistically expressed meaning, we try to show which place may be assigned to naming within the framework of an Husserlian phenomenology.<br>

Abstract: Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, les principaux aspects de la définition et de la compréhension « aristotélicienne » de la métaphore ont été mis en question: théorie de la substitution, teleologie de l'univocité, subordination de la métaphore à la connaissance, et jusqu'à la centralité même conférée à la métaphore aux dépens d'autres figures (métonymie, synecdoque, catachrèse. .. ). Dans cet article, nous tentons de résumer et de discuter les points essentiels de cette contestation multiforme, en nous attachant particulièrement à la déconstruction derridienne de la métaphore « dans le texte philosophique » et à la synthèse, par Ricoeur, de la « nouvelle » théorie de la métaphore. In the second half of the twentieth century, the main aspects of the « aristotelian » definition and understanding of metaphor have been questioned : substitution-theory, teleology of univocity, subordination of metaphor to knowledge, and the very centrality attributed to metaphor at the expense of other tropes (metonymy, synecdoque, catachresis...). In this paper, we try to summarize and discuss various aspects of this dispute, paying special attention to Derrida's deconstruction of metaphor « in the philosophical text » and to Ricoeur's synthesis of the « new » theory of metaphor.<br>

Abstract: Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari have proposed that the structure of western knowledge can be reconceived according to a 'rhizomatic' model, which focuses on the unlimited relations that interconnect all things in the cosmos and on the spaces of dynamic interaction between then. Applied to the field of biblical interpretation, rhizomatic hermeneutics promises to avert the nihilism latent within biblical historical positivism, provide a theoretical framework for exploring the relations between the interpreter and the text, and reintroduce ethics to the practice of biblical interpretation. A 'rhizomatic' model of hermeneutics has the advantage of recognizing the broader ecology within which biblical hermeneutics actually functions, including the subjectivity of the interpreter, and the role of interpreting communities.<br>

Abstract: The author of the article in question reports on a study analysing how 15 year-old French lycée pupils interpret school texts about the representation of the Norman kings of Sicily in the 12th century, the latter of whom allowed themselves to be portrayed both as Byzantine emperors and as Muslim caliphs. Ever since Moscovic's theory of social representation, we know that people make sense of specialized knowledge (in this case, historical knowledge) by converting it into "naïve", everyday knowledge. As pupils generally cannot explain the political intentions of the kings of Sicily, the lycée pupils were asked – as part of the study – to deal with the assertions of a paper (written by another pupil) that compared the Norman kingdom of Sicily and the situation of Maghrebine immigrants in presentday France. The study takes a closer look at how the learners, in the course of the "spiral-shaped" learning process, first acquired a "naïve" picture of the kings of Sicily, only later to distance themselves from their original thoughts in order to be able to make sense of their school texts. Der Autor des vorliegenden Artikels berichtet über eine Untersuchung, die analysiert, wie 15-jährige französische Gymnasiasten Schulmaterialen über die Repräsentationen der normannischen Könige von Sizilien im 12. Jahrhundert interpretieren. Letztere ließen sich sowohl als byzantinische Kaiser wie auch als muslimische Kalifen darstellen. Seit Moscovicis Theorie der sozialen Repräsentationen wissen wir, dass Menschen Fachwissen (hier historischem Wissen) einen Sinn geben, indem sie es in ein „naives" Alltagswissen verwandeln. Da Schüler im Allgemeinen die politischen Intentionen der Könige von Sizilien nicht erklären können, wurden im Rahmen dieser Untersuchung Gymnasiasten aufgefordert, sich mit einer schriftlichen Schülerarbeit zu befassen, die das normannische Königreich von Sizilien und die Situation maghrebinischer Einwanderer im heutigen Frankreich vergleicht.

Abstract: Since the Kantian revolution, metaphysical knowledge has been articulated by influential theologians in the language of analogy. In accordance with this tradition, the metaphor found in Luke-Acts, that God does live in houses, but not houses built by men, is explored by studying it as a root metaphor. A root metaphor in the theological sense can be defined as the most basic assumption we can make about man's existence and experience. In this article John H Elliott's proposal that 'temple' and 'household' in Luke-Acts articulate a contrast in social institutions is debated. I wish to argue that this 'contrast' does not really articulate a shift in social institutions, but rather a broadening of an existing social institution as the result of a changed symbolic universe. This shift in symbolic universe is studied against the backdrop of a tendency to broaden the temple as a theological symbol which had already started and which intensified during the Second temple period. It is shown that the temple, its sacrificial offerings and purifying rituals, were closely associated with the household, its meals and purifying ceremonies. Jesus also advocated the broadening of the concept temple/household. His view is reportedly conveyed by Stephen, Peter, James, and Paul.<br>

Abstract: Inquiry in the social sciences is based on theoretical assumptions that are not always clearly articulated in research reports. This article surveys some of the theoretical positions that underlie various qualitative research methods and discusses some of the methodological issues raised by those positions. The four themes that serve as anchor points for the discussion are contextualization, an approach to social-scientific observation that takes into account the environment in which the observational event takes place; understanding, an approach to the problem of knowledge and explanation that addresses the range of what can be learned from observation; pluralism, the proposition that not only social settings but the methods for explaining them resist reduction to a single model; and expression, the problem of conveying the results of research.<br>

Abstract: For most of its modern history library and information science has been governed by the mode of thinking best characterized as positivism. This epistemology, shared with most of the social sciences for some time, features the quest for universal laws and the reduction of all phenomena, including behavioral, cognitive, and so on, to the physical, among other elements. This means to knowledge is unworkable for this field; a proposed replacement for it is hermeneutical phenomenology. This article outlines the elements of a revised epistemological approach that seeks an understanding of the essences of things (such as the library) and that takes into account, among other things, the intentional stances of the human actors within the realm of library and information science. Such a re-formed epistemology allows for a different set of questions asked and a different approach to answering them.<br>

Abstract: The growth of knowledge in any discipline depends on discursive practice for the assertion of claims and the assessment of claims. At times, however, that discursive practice may be ideological in nature. Ideology is here defined as being grounded in efforts at domination--the ascendance of some ideas over others. Examination of the incidence of ideology in discourse is necessarily interpretive; part of this article explores the application of hermeneutics to the analysis of discourse. A set of examples of discursive practice in library and information science (LIS), purposely selected, is examined for ideological intent. Ultimately, the aim is to demonstrate that some discourse is ideological in nature and purpose, and to point out the implications of such discursive practice for knowledge growth in LIS.<br>

Abstract: As a Catholic historian, this theme raises particular difficulties for me, since the notion of specific patterns of thought is one I would not use, and the term 'contemporary history' is much too vague. Of course, Catholic scholars, no less than their protestant counterparts, still recognize the need to raise questions about the nature of history and its analysis, despite the various unsuccessful attempts in the past when systematic theologians have failed to come to terms with the reality of historical events, as in the unhistorically conceived 'New Scholasticism'. The concept of 'freedom', for example, is one which requires new conceptualization in our present historical context. If we accept the current view that all rationalist theories of knowledge are in fact based on an act of 'faith', so we have to see that the belief in the primacy of 'Reason' cannot any longer be maintained. Which does not mean that we have to take flight into 'unreason', or abandon rational categories of thought. What we need to find is some manner by which 'faith' can be anchored as a final justification, over and above any transcendental basis. In our present pluralistic world this will have to be to presented in a variety of ways. But at least it calls for a new consideration of how to relate 'faith' and 'knowledge'.<br>

Abstract: Cet article prend appui sur une enquête ethnographique de longue durée au sein d'un syndicat local de cheminots CFDT. Il s'inscrit dans une problématique constructiviste, envisageant la réalité sociale comme une construction historique et quotidienne des acteurs sociaux. Il tente plus précisément, dans ce cadre et à partir de matériaux empiriques, de réévaluer, à propos de l'univers syndical, les rapports entre connaissance savante et connaissance ordinaire ; d'où la notion d'epistemologie ordinaire du syndicalisme qui prend pour objet tout à la fois les sociologies des chercheurs professionnels et les sociologies mises en œuvre quotidiennement par les acteurs syndicaux. Il se démarque alors tant de la tradition de la rupture épistémologique entre travail scientifique et savoirs ordinaires que de la tendance à l'indifférenciation des pratiques savantes et ordinaires propre à l'ethnométhodologie. This article is based on a long range ethnographie survey within a CFDT local railway workers' union. It follows a constructivist problematics line, considering social reality as a daily and historical construction by social actors. More precisely, it attempts, within this framework and starting from empirical material, to reassess, in the trade union universe, the relation between scholarly and ordinary knowledge, which leads to the concept of an ordinary epistemology of trade unionism. The object of this is both the sociology of professional researchers and the sociology used daily by trade unionists. It is different both from the tradition of the epistemological break between scientific and ordinary knowledge and from the tendency to the indifferentiation of scholarly and ordinary practices proper to ethnomethodology.<br>

Abstract: Les jumelages constituent la première forme d'action internationale impliquant les institutions municipales en tant que telles. L'émergence de cette activité correspond à un processus d'invention de la tradition. Comprendre les tensions politiques occasionnées par ce processus donne accès à des mobilisations méconnues qui ont pourtant affecté les règles du jeu municipal. Retracer ces différents épisodes de l'histoire politique contribue autant à la compréhension de certaines entreprises politiques de la IVe République qu'à la découverte des conditions de possibilité d'évolutions ultérieures du jeu diplomatique, telle la coopération décentralisée. Town twinning can be seen as the first activity to involve municipal institutions as such in wideranging and long-term international action by councilors. Twinning fits Eric Hobsbawm's definition of an invented tradition. The invention of town twinning cannot be studied without a profound knowledge of the dynamic political tensions which emerged in the Cold War French political scene. Mobilizations led to a big turn in common interpretations of the municipal law. The study of this process helps understand the institutional change which made possible the rise of paradiplomacy in France.<br>

Abstract: A ideia de máquina ultrapassa as suas concretizações materiais sugerindo um certo tipo de objetividade e autonomia, inerente ao funcionamento de sistemas como o Direito. A conceção do Direito como uma espécie de máquina jurídica é ambivalente, mostrando tanto a imparcialidade do Direito como as suas perversões anti-humanas. A relação entre mente e corpo é central no Direito da responsabilidade, sugerindo, porém, uma máquina humana em que a responsabilidade corresponde apenas a uma técnica de preservação de um sistema. A pessoa, todavia, não tem de ser reduzida a um algoritmo como diz Penrose. É a configuração do objeto do Direito que o reduz a um funcionamento limitado e incapaz de uma justiça criativa. A redefinição do objeto humano no Direito reclama um novo pensamento, associado aos conhecimentos não jurídicos sobre o comportamento humano. The idea of machine exceeds its material embodiments suggesting a certain kind of objectivity and autonomy inherent to the functioning of systems such as Law. The conception of Law as a kind of legal machine is ambivalent, showing both the impartiality of the law as their anti-human perversions. The relationship between mind and body is central to the law of responsibility, even though suggesting a human machine on which liability is merely a technique for preserving a system. The person, however, need not be reduced to an algorithm as Penrose says. It is the configuration of the object of knowledge as a system identical to a machine and the subjects of norms as human machines which reduces it to a limited and incapable of running a creative justice. The redefinition of the human object in Law calls for a new thinking, not necessary associated with the legal knowledge about human behavior.<br>

Abstract: This article analyses the difficult relation between anthropology and history. The point, therefore, is to show how anthropology conceptualises the past differently from history as a discipline. Beginning with the differences between anthropology and history in terms of the concept of time, the article highlights that while for history time is concrete, objective and exogenous to human beings, for anthropology it is characterised by its being condensed, collectively subjective and endogenous. By analyzing actual examples, the article shows that the anthropologist is not interested in the past per se, but rather in the past as a dimension of the present. Accordingly, actualised, revised and manipulated history as well as the role of the past in the present need to be taken into account. Consequently, history and the past have their own specific efficiency because they are also a form of knowledge and social resource mobilised by single individuals or groups to find their bearings and act accordingly in the present and likewise to plan the future.<br>

Abstract: This paper is an attempt to explore the continuing relevance of Nietzsche's genealogical analysis of Western rationality to the sociology of knowledge. While Nietzsche is often neglected in classical sociological theory textbooks, this paper argues that Nietzsche has a very significant contribution to sociological theory especially in the field of knowledge production. Recent sociologists are now acknowledging this tradition. Hence this paper discusses how the basic tenets of Nietzsche's critique of Western metaphysics and positivism can be harnessed to create a powerful critique of contemporary sociological understanding of knowledge construction and its legitimation in society. Some of these themes are discussed at the end of the paper especially in relation to Philippine sociology.<br>

Abstract: Archaeology assumes itself as a discipline through a practice of boundary-making that merges the past with the present. It is, in this practice, increasingly critiqued for being ethnocentric and separating power from the communities it claims to represent. In response, archaeology is experiencing a turn toward "community". Examining two community archaeology case studies, we assess whether archaeology can be transformed into a discipline that productively participates in the liveliness and messy connectedness of objects, peoples, histories and cultures— in contrast to a conventionally detached practice of objectifying other peoples' lifeways. In both cases, archaeological and descent communities play direct and central decision-making roles in this traditionally "distanced" discipline. They demonstrate means of re-figuring archaeology as a participatory practice. Community-founded archaeology is thus shown to transform methods commonly supporting institutional reproduction into a radically indigenous, emically structured, set of knowledge practices and outcomes. Archeologie suppose elle-même comme une discipline à travers une pratique de fabrication limite qui fusionne le passé au présent. Il est, dans cette pratique, plus en plus critiqué pour avoir été puissance ethnocentrique et séparation des communautés qu'elle prétend représenter. En réponse, archéologie connaît un tournant vers une « communauté ». Examen de deux études de cas communautaires archéologie, nous déterminer si archéologie peut se transformer en une discipline qui productivement participe à la vivacité et la connectivité désordre des objets, des peuples, des histoires et des cultures—contrairement à une pratique conventionnelle détachée d'objectiver les modes de vie des autres peuples. En cas, archéologiques et descente communautés jouent des rôles décisionnels directes et centrales dans ce traditionnellement « distanciés » discipline.

Abstract: Selon un débat ouvert dès le Ve siècle avant notre ère et cristallisé par les réflexions d'Aristote dans la Poétique, l'enquête historique serait tenue de rapporter ce qui a lieu ou a eu lieu, dans le temps sans limite et indéfini des hommes, accumulant des faits particuliers. Le projet des historiens serait-il de s'épuiser à dresser ainsi un infini et impossible "inventaire du monde" ? Dans le contexte des cités, la prose historique et le périple géographique correspondent à de nouvelles formes d'enquête et proposent des mises en ordre du savoir inédites. Leurs auteurs s'interrogent sur leurs capacités démonstratives et sur les moyens de parvenir à une "vue d'ensemble" (Polybe) des "événements qui surviennent du fait des hommes" (Hérodote), que l'objet d'étude porte sur une très courte période, comme chez Thucydide ou concerne l'ensemble du "monde habité", dans la Géographie de Strabon. Cette étude analyse, notamment à partir des termes άνθρωποι et οικουμένη, comment ces auteurs répondent à un des défis de la narration historique et de la description géographique qui consiste à inscrire la généralisation dans le cadre du particulier. According to the debate opened up as early as the Vth century before our era and condensed by Aristotle's reflections in the Poetics, historical enquiry would be bound to account for what does or did take place in men's limitless and indefinite time, thus piling up particular facts. Would the historians' goal be to exhaust themselves in thus drawing up an endless and impossible "inventory of the world" ? In the context of the cities, historical prose and geographic circumnavigation correspond to new forms of enquiry and propound unheard of ways of setting knowledge into order. Their authors inquire into their demonstrative abilities and the means to obtain "a general view" (Polybius) "of the events that happen through men's agency" (Herodotus), whether the subject under study bears on a very short period, as with Thucydides, or concern~<br>

Platão antecipou a concepção propondo uma dialéctica ascendente, completada por uma dialéctica descendente, cuja dinâmica fora objecto de pesquisa nas suas últimas obras. A metafísica encontra-se na intersecção destas duas dialécticas, no eixo em que a primeira passa na outra. Este eixo começa a fazer sentido a partir do saber que o pensamento tem de si mesmo. A mentalidade representativa, desatenta à especificidade deste eixo, não consegue aceder à dimensão dos caminhos da razão. O eixo no coração das dialécticas clássicas é assumido pela metafísica contemporânea em termos de tempo associado com o espírito vivo em detrimento do ser conceptual. Aristotelian metaphysics does not consider being qua being in itself, but rather as a symbol of what is, for the spirit, at once the most universal and the most particular. Plato had anticipated the conception, the dynamic of which had been the object of investigation in his last works. Metaphysics finds itself at the intersection of these two dialectics, at the axis around which the first passes into the other. The axis takes its sense from the knowledge that thought has of itself. The mentality, based on representation, inattentive to the specificity of this axis, does not have access to the amplitude of the paths that reason can take. The axis at the heart of classic dialectics is taken up by contemporary metaphysics in terms of time associated with the living spirit rather than as conceptual being.<br>

Author(s): Muscari Paul G.<br>
Abstract: What is the future of the poetic figures in a technological and scientific world where a more restricted view appears to be emerging as to what is adequate and relevant about metaphors? What part should the radical trope play in a script where the figures that are heralded are usually those that are perceived as having practical importance, i. e., those that fill in the gaps of existing knowledge? It will be the intent of this paper to show that the current preoccupation of much of philosophy and psychology with structural explanation and cognitive theory has certainly contributed to establishing a coordinated and unified theory of metaphors, but left unto itself such a concern is severely limited and does not adequately explain the full potential of metaphorical expressions.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: A la fin du XIVe siècle, le Dialogue de Catherine de Sienne expose, par sa construction littéraire extrêmement élaborée, la conversion du mouvement raisonnable de recherche du divin en mouvement intelligent de contemplation, la conversion du langage théologique en langage de l'intelligence de l'âme, la conversion du langage difficile de la raison en langage métaphorique audible par tous et susceptible de ramener tous les hommes dans l'obéissance à l'Eglise. La méthode de connaissance recommandée par Catherine est celle des larmes. At the end of the 14th century, the Dialogo of Catherine of Sienna expounds in a very elaborate literary construction the conversion of the reasonable search for the divine into intelligent contemplation, the conversion of theological language into that of the comprehending soul, the conversion of the difficult language of the reason into a metaphorical one, understandable to everyone and fit to bring all men back to obedience to the Church. The method of knowledge which Catherine advises is that of the tears. En el final del siglo XIV, el Dialogo de Caterina de Sena por su construcción literaria muy elaborada expone la conversión del movimiento racional de búsqueda de Dios en el movimiento inteligente de contemplación, la conversión del lenguaje teológico en el lenguaje de la inteligencia del alma, la conversión del lenguaje difícil de la razón en el lenguaje metafórico que todos entienden y que puede reducir a todos en la obediencia a la Iglesia. El método de conocimiento preconizado por Caterina es el de las lágrimas.<br>

Abstract: La conception de la contemplation et de la vie contemplative connaît une évolution intéressante dans un ordre contemplatif par excellence, celui des Chartreux entre ses débuts et la fin du XIIIe siècle. Cet article tente d'explorer ce tournant à partir de l'analyse de trois auteurs: Guigues II, Hugues de Balma, Guigues du Pont. Héritier de la tradition monastique de la lectio divina, le premier met en place l'échelle des moines montant de la lecture à la méditation, à la prière et à la contemplation. Mais le second en scie les barreaux : concevant une théologie mystique, union affective à Dieu sans connaissance antécédente ou concomitante, il conduit au paradoxe d'une vie contemplative sans contemplation. Les distinctions subtiles du dernier rendent à la théologie mystique une contemplation anagogique et font place à ses côtés à une contemplation spéculative des philosophes, des théologiens, des mystiques. The understanding of contemplation and the contemplative life sees an interesting evolution in an order contemplative par excellence, the Carthusians, between its beginnings and the end of the XIIIth century. On the basis of the analyses of three authors, Guigues II, Hugh of Balma, and Guigues Du Pont, this article endeavors to explore this turn. Heir to the monastic tradition of lectio divina, the first sets in place the ladder for monks ascending from reading to meditation, from prayer to contemplation. Yet the second saws apart the rungs. Conceiving of a mystical theology, an affective union with God without preceding or concomitant knowledge, he shows the way to the paradox of a contemplative life without contemplation. The subtle distinctions of the last bestow upon mystical theology an anagogic contemplation and clear the away around it for a speculative contemplation of the philosophers, theologians and mystics.<br>

Abstract: Clark (2011) recently reviewed literature on cognitive phenomena such as automaticity, non-conscious processing, and the "illusion of conscious will," concluding that most learning theories and instructional design models are informed by faulty assumptions regarding psychological functioning—namely, that most cognitive activity is conscious and volitional. Clark offered a number of recommendations for educational technology research and design based on the view that cognitive activity is mostly automated, unconscious, and determined by psychological variables outside of personal control. This response presents an alternative perspective and accompanying recommendations distinct from those offered by Clark. It primarily argues that evidence pertaining to automaticity and related phenomena may be reinterpreted to fit within a view of agency that emphasizes meaning, purpose, tacit knowledge, and narrative structure; and that this agentic view leads to a number of potentially fruitful avenues for theorizing and research in educational technology.<br>

The main argument is that constructivist inquiries need to develop not only objectified (or experience-distant) but also subjective (experience-near) knowledge about social and international life. This requirement derives from the fact that constructivism is a postfoundationalist style of reasoning which emphasizes the mutually constitutive dialectics between the social construction of knowledge and the contruction of social reality. By implication, a constructivist methodology should be inductive, interpretive, and historical. The methodical practice of sobjectivism follows a three-step logic from the recovery of subjective meanings to their objectification thanks to contextualization and historicization. A brief discussion of the security-community research program illustrates what sobjectivism looks like in practice. Overall, not only does the development of a consistent methodology systematize the practice of constructivist research, it also fosters engagement and dialog with other international relations approaches. By clarifying where constructivism falls on issues of validity, falsifiability, and generalizability, this article intends to enhance mutual legibility among competing methodologies.<br>

Article Title: Enlightenment as Process: Milton and Habermas<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219804<br>
Date: 10 1, 1962<br>
Author(s): Williams Donald L.<br>
Abstract: Reason as the medium of truth and freedom-though suppressed, the idea returns; it is presumed by our very participation in discourse. Its opponents say that only practices are real. But, as Milton and Habermas know, reason is itself a practice. Milton's "free and lawful debate at all times... of what opinion soever" recognizes interestedness, perspectivity, and struggle; Habermas's unconstrained communication is a neverachieved goal (an "ideal") regulating discursive practices here and now. Both writers recognize that meanings are cultural, social, and existential, that knowledge cannot be separated from interests; but they do not therefore stand outside praxis rhapsodizing about struggle and contingency. Instead, they seek to move toward social freedom and individual autonomy through reason-able communication-that ongoing search for unforced agreement which is our usual and best alternative to violence, our usual and best way to find meaning in the world, in our selves, and in one another.<br>

Article Title: Aesthetics and Ethics in Gadamer, Levinas, and Romanticism: Problems of Phronesis and Techne<br>
Publisher: Modern Language Association of America<br>
Issue: i219848<br>
Date: 1 1, 1995<br>
Author(s): Wyschogrod David P.<br>
Abstract: Aristotle's distinction between phronesis, or ethical knowledge, and techne, or productive knowledge, is relevant both to Romantic and to modern discussions of the relations between aesthetic and ethical experience. Wordsworth and Coleridge try in different ways to negotiate between the two kinds of knowledge, advocating the ethical force of poetry while acknowledging its status as techne; in contrast, modern criticism tends either to accept the ubiquity of techne or to revive phronesis while undervaluing the tension between the two. Hans-Georg Gadamer and Emmanuel Levinas provide a way to link phronesis to aesthetic autonomy through the means-end unity of phronesis and the ethical claim of the other, although Gadamer overemphasizes the autonomy of the artwork and Levinas underemphasizes the ethical possibilities of the aesthetic. Wordsworth and Coleridge present the ethical encounter with the other as in tension with techne, but they also show that tension itself to be ethically significant.<br>

Author(s): Thompson Paul<br>
Abstract: In any field of experience anthropologists are confronted by spates of signs, many of which they fail to perceive. By way of an analysis of the mundane activities associated with riding a Songhay bush taxi in the Republic of Niger, this article probes the reflexive process through which anthropologist and ethnographic other learn to interpret the signs that comprise the discourse of social action. Having been confronted repeatedly with the signs of the other's universe, anthropologists may not only gain a new awareness of the sociocultural systems they seek to uncover but may also realize the limitations of their knowledge. Through what Dilthey called the hermeneutic, anthropologists will be more able to proceed profoundly and accurately toward an understanding of those signs that give substance and order to the complexities of social universes.

Author(s): Whitten Janet Wall<br>
Abstract: Language is constitutive of social reality through the constant articulation and reinforcement of significant linguistic concepts, which give meaning to social relations. Among the Shuar of southeastern Ecuador, discourses on power and knowledge validate the traditional ideological structure and create a new ideological structure through the mobilization of meaning in political speech that legitimates relations of domination. Ideological transformation is assisted by a cultural predisposition to seek non-Shuar sources of technical and symbolic knowledge in the acquisition of power.

Abstract: The relationships among texts, readers, and moral community are explored in order to understand the dissonance and interplay of personal and textual authority in local Islamic practice (Sunni, Shaf'i branch) among Malagasy-speaking villagers of Mayotte (Comoro Islands, East Africa). A political economy of knowledge approach is linked to an analysis of recitation as a ritual activity in which illocutionary force exceeds referential meaning. The discussion has relevance for the understanding of the relationship between religious knowledge, power, and action in Islamic societies as well as of the interface between the oral and the written more generally.

Author(s): Wikan James M.<br>
Abstract: This study among the Maneo (Seram, Indonesia) focuses on the pragmatics of kinship knowledge. Through an extended investigation of a stranger's arrival, I untangle processes of recognition from those guiding the determination of relatedness. Recognition establishes the continuity of experience; as such, verity is a measure of the adequacy as opposed to accuracy of observation: a fact that contributes to the possibility of misrecognition. By contrast, relatedness is contingent upon the expression and suppression of different, sometimes contradictory historical ties. [kinship, knowledge, pragmatism, Maneo, Indonesia]<br>

Author(s): Zeman Milton<br>
Abstract: Peirce's general theory of signs, or semiotic, as he called it, yields a theory of the self that sees it both as the object and the subject of semiotic systems. From this viewpoint, the locus, unity, and continuity of the self will be found in the systems of signs that constitute the dialogues between utterers and interpreters of the signs. Personal identity, in this theory, is also a social and cultural identity and is not confined to the individual organism. Peirce's anti-Cartesianism, which denies intuitive and introspective knowledge of the self, derived that knowledge from the fallible inferences we all make from the observations of external facts, including the signs of the self. This laid the foundation for a semiotic psychology as well as for a semiotic anthropology<br>

Author(s): Williamson Bradd<br>
Abstract: Cultural cognition is the product of two different sorts of meaning: (a) the (objective) semiotic organization of cultural texts or models, and (b) the (subjective) processes of meaning construction through which cultural symbols become available to consciousness as "experience." This article proposes a way to bridge these two kinds of meaning by considering how cultural knowledge is grounded in sensory experience. Several cognitive processes (schematization, synesthesia, secondary intersubjectivity) are proposed for linking the objectively available schemata found in cultural practices and the processes of meaning construction by which individuals appropriate symbols to consciousness. The nature of the relation between public symbols and individual experience is discussed in relation to a number of current issues in post-structuralist culture theory.<br>

Publisher: Sage Publications<br>
Issue: i228044<br>
Date: 1 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Yoxen Anne<br>
Abstract: Representations of the active brain have served to establish a particular domain of competence for brain mappers and to distinguish brain mapping's particular contributions to mind/brain research. At the heart of the claims about the emerging contributions of functional brain mapping is a paradox: functional imagers seem to reject representations while also using them at multiple points in their work. This article therefore considers a love-hate relationship between scientists and their object: the case of the iconoclastic imager. This paradoxical stance is the result of the formation of an interdisciplinary approach that brings together a number of scientific traditions and their particular standards of what constitutes scientific evidence. By examining the various ways in which images are deployed and rejected, the origins of these conflicting tendencies can be traced to the technological, methodological, and institutional elements in the work of functional imagers. This approach provides insight into the current demarcation of imaging and reflects on features of visual knowledge.<br>

Abstract: This paper applies the critical theory of Jürgen Habermas to theoretical issues in criminology. Since criminologists have generally neglected the critical tradition, we include a brief summation of concerns central to critical sociology. These concerns include a defense of reason and a provocative critique of both culture and science. We then apply the critical model to themes and issues in criminology. Specifically, our analysis uses Habermas' three "knowledge constitutive interests" to reconceptualize cultural explanations of crime, to address the linkage between macro-and micro-levels of explanation, and to outline a novel interpretation of the relationship between culture and social structure. We conclude with a critique of Habermas' prescription for social change.<br>

Abstract: There is a case, however, for seeing research as necessarily being involved in its first stage in ‘strangemaking’. It is only by making the commonplace first of all ‘strange’ that one can attain the critical distance required for research to proceed. Ethnomethodology makes this its primary mode of practice. Garfinkel, its originator, analysed in detail the methods used by people in everyday life to account for (make sense of) their activities for themselves and for others. He thus saw ethnomethodology as the study of commonsense knowledge of social structures so as to make sociological reasoning analysable. Ethnomethodology was the subject of fierce debate within sociology departments. Some of its insights have been taken into mainstream sociological theory, particularly through the work of Anthony Giddens.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on the concepts of deliberative democracy and African palaver to conceptually (re) formulate and make intelligible the practices and performance of governance in Africa, with the aim of achieving a genuine normalization of societal behavior. Based on an analysis of the texts and a synthesis of texts analyzed, and drawing on the evidence at the present time, this is about establishing that the African palaver, often excluded from the cartography of official epistemology and relegated to the level of indigenous knowledge and practice, can define the conditions of possibility and feasibility for deliberative democracy, a political paradigm deemed dominant universal. However, the issue is that of cognitive decentering. How can one imagine that African conceptual categories, labeled as cheesy and reduced to the mere field of ethnological studies, can interact and correlate with modern recipes, with the idea of starting a process of governability, the realization of which is resilient democracy?<br>

Abstract: Offering a “pharmacological” perspective, this essay elaborates on the Chilean Roberto Bolaño's novel
         2666. It discusses narrative imaginaries that regraph cultural experiences and spaces of self-consciousness as they emerge from singular global south networks. In2666, the Mexican-U.S. border region operates as a fraught site through which a global aesthetics of sobriety gains shape and texture, a phenomenon upon which Bolaño's text depends for its critique of Western academic knowledge. From there, I consider how a “pharmacological” problematization of Western culture can reshape our perspective of the constitution of a global modernity.<br>

Abstract: Recent scholarship has given considerable attention to lyric poetry as a form of sensuous knowledge. This approach emphasizes the corporeal origins of poetry, its genesis in the body or in language viewed as material. The question of sensuous knowledge is central to the larger theoretical issue of modernity itself, in which lyric holds a central yet ambiguous status. The question of sensuous knowledge is ultimately a question of meaning. However, modern thought — thought pertaining to “modernity” — is fundamentally circular. This would seem to establish an epistemological impasse for aesthetics. But I argue that this circularity offers an important, and necessary, way to limit knowledge and thereby ground an ethical subjectivity. My essay places formalism at the heart of sensuous knowledge. In this essay I develop an account of the importance of abstraction in sensuous knowledge by way of Kant's concept of
         Darstellung, “presentation [of sensory experience].” The “presentation” is the object as it has undergone a structural process of internalization and been made available for psychic use as meaning; that requires a recognition of loss. Where this is important for literature is that twentieth-century American poetry frequently uses very personal images of family life as a way of conveying sincerity about corporeal experience. I use this discussion of circularity in modern aesthetic thought to argue that there is a risk to taking shortcuts to meaning through images of the material bodies of children. In these contemporary poems by Gary Snyder, Sharon Olds and Rita Dove, the poets reject loss in favor of a very modern “affirmation” of the material. But affirmation and the visual image as a sign of affirmation cannot alone bind meaning to us. That meaning must be internalized through theworkof poetic presentation.<br>

Abstract: Is the most important function of education to provide students with basic skills and useful knowledge in order to eventually become employable? In many parts of the world knowledge league tables and policy documents inform us this is the case. As the question of what should form the educational content seems to be answered, teachers can concentrate on how they should teach, and researchers can concentrate on what method is the most effective. In the current rhetoric, however, many vital pedagogical issues have been placed in the background and the aesthetic subjects are downgraded. These tendencies worried Frede V. Nielsen who stated that didactic studies and philosophical inquiries yet again are needed to explore and give substance to the content dimension. Nielsen's writings on didactics form the basis for this essay, where we highlight which perspectives and dilemmas could be placed on a critical, philosophical didactic study agenda. The starting point is the field of tension between the what and the why of education.<br>

Abstract: A book proposing an overview of “African literature” is a very attractive proposition to the new reader seeking orientation in a vast and fastgrowing vibrant field, to the expert in one area looking to explore others, and perhaps also to the publisher with a canny eye to the bottom line. This essay examines the often bewildering array of apparent subcategories that emerge in some key texts published around the turn of the twentieth-first century that purport to offer an overview of African literature in French, but which seem to entirely set aside important international debates over “postcolonial,” diaspora, and hybridity, among others. These texts have an important role in the construction of knowledge of “African literature,” but their strengths and limitations become clear when we look closely at the categories suggested and no more so than when the category happens to be that of “identity.”<br>

Abstract: One poem, “After Shakespeare,” sounds particularly Shakespearean: it is the only poem in the set that draws exclusively from the Bard's lexical fields (“disloyal moon!”), so that its echoes emphasize the distance between the other sonnagrams and Shakespeare:
         
               
            For lovers oft from thee great boldness draw
               To do like acts of mutiny below;
               A tacit metamorphosis of law
               Informs their fervent antidote to woe
            
               Leftover letters are one of the hazards of the anagram machine. Mohammad explains, “Each Sonnagram, including its title, is an anagram of a standard modern-spelling version of one of Shakespeare's Sonnets, containing exactly the same letters in the same distribution as the original. The title is composed last, using whatever letters are left over once I've assembled a working sonnet in iambic pentameter with an English rhyme scheme.”(RP and F with WS [RP];
               [RP] PP with WH [VD]).
               ———
               [Sonnet 37 (“As a decrepit father takes delight”)]
            
                     
               138
                  
               Some have read the leftover letters in the concluding couplet as presenting a false encryption for the reader, linking it to Shakespeare's mysterious dedication of his sonnets in 1609 to “Mr. WH.”139
            
               The initials are also familiar to readers of modernist poetry: WS might stand in for William Shakespeare, but it might also refer to Wallace Stevens, just as WH are Auden's famous initials … But perhaps it is merely a trap to believe that decoding is possible. The point of the poem may be that knowledge of the canon, or intertextual expertise, leads only to dead ends. But if the leftover letters that stud the poem are read as recombinatory elements that follow the logic of DNA sequencing—so that language itself is a constant reproduction of combinatory possibility—the poem offer~<br>

Abstract: We meet a mind grappling with a world that is being ruthlessly exploited. The exploitation of the world plays itself out in the lives of the people, as the second stanza reveals. One is reminded of Africa's struggles with neoimperialism. Africa's natural resources are being used for the development of other parts of the world. Such exploitation contributes to the implosion of different units of African life: the family, the village, the county, the city, and the country. What this and other poems aim to achieve, therefore, is to raise our consciousness of the precariousness of the African world as seen from Liberia. This is the most that poets or tragedians can do, and they do so in the knowledge or the hope that the audience or the reader will be moved to relate to that world, as Aristotle might have anticipated.<br>

Abstract: Throughout this discussion I have attempted to pay attention to geographical, spatial meanings as the material basis in our discussion. This is especially true in any study of diasporas since they involve movement through space over land and seascapes. Diasporas define orientations within situations of transculturation. They emphasize the religious meaning evoked from the transhumance capability of the human mode of being. Sacrality is often understood through vertical metaphors, with the gods and divine beings above, the human below, and the earth below. Along with this vertical metaphor, diasporic orientations bring to the fore the horizontal dimension of sacrality and the role of distance and movement in the revelation of sacrality and knowledge.<br>

Abstract: Here is a final evocation of the unique nonsortal essence, which implicitly, I believe, argues for a nonsortal sense of oneself, works against the temptation to see “I” as merely a numerical individuation comparable to two identical peas, and thus also suggests a filled significant or existential-moral meaning for the question of nonsortal individuality.

                  What is at stake here is not whether memory is essential for identifying by way of criteria oneself throughout time but, rather, whether there is a nonsortal loose and odd sense of oneself and one's identity that may be more basic and may persist in the absence of memory—as the basis for our proper strong sense of having an identifying knowledge of ourselves. We may consider that even prior to such a thought experiment as I here propose we are already perhaps familiar with the small child's ability to make first-person references without having an arsenal of identifying properties that the parent and others have, for example, regarding his physiognomy, voice timbre, kind, lineage, gender, kinship, ethnicity, nationality, and so on and so forth. And we are more or less familiar with real or imagined cases of the amnesiac who says “I” and yet does not know who in the world she is; that is, she is bereft of any identifying properties but still achieves “I” inerrantly.33<br>

Abstract: I had spent the summer of 1960 studying Greek and working as a laundry truck driver for the Alert Laundry Company, who's cliental lived in the ghetto that surrounded the University of Chicago. That summer, of the thirteen laundry trucks of the Alert Laundry Company, twelve were robbed. Mine wasn't. I got to know everybody, including the robbers, who gave me a pass. That summer marked the beginning of an education that allowed me to see, firsthand, the real injustice of America, which in the course of events led to the civil rights movement, whose northern base was Chicago. Looking back over the events of my life I can say that although I was born in Iowa, I grew up in Chicago. Clearly, the University of Chicago provided me with a dual education: one that made it possible for me to earn academic degrees and another that afforded a set of experiences that transformed my life. As a result of all that, the changing times and the Chicago experience, much to the chagrin of those who hired me at Boston College, I began to teach a number of courses on social phenomenology (Schutz), attempting to do a kind of social philosophy, which, of course, was a very respectable thing, still being done today. Then in 1971 I went to Germany to perfect my German and by accident ended up at the University of Marburg (Phillips Universität Marbug), the most radical university in Germany at the time. There I was appropriately intimidated, mainly by German students, regarding my knowledge of political philosophy as it related to the most celebrated figure of the day, Karl Marx. I returned to Boston at the end of that summer harboring a passion for finding out what Marx was about. After reading several books on Marx I decided that he couldn't be as bad as his representatives portrayed him, and I started reading the man himself. Like many others I was seduced, converted, overwhelmed, transformed by the encounter, which led to a long struggle with the man and his work from which I never fully re~<br>

Abstract: This statement expresses a postmodern perspective more effectively than such concepts as deconstruction, death of God, poststructuralism, or genealogical thought. By virtue of is vagueness it articulates the absence of a defining subject, mastering terms, or a foundation for thought. It privileges varieties of approach and subject matter that destabilize each other and avoids a definitive framework that would guide the organization. Instead it offers SPEP as an open space for incompatible as well as compatible types of knowledge, approach, and philosophical sensibility. It affirms an indeterminate ambiguity in all words that people might otherwise interpret as centralizing and directive in an exclusive way. I believe that it reflects a kind of democratic pluralism rather more than the philosophical traditions could tolerate that came from Europe and played defining roles in SPEP's early years. I am quite sure that some of the organization's early leaders would consider the mission statement no less nihilistic than they found Nietzsche, Sartre, Derrida, Foucault, and all other philosophers identified as postmodern in 1980.<br>

Abstract: Or take an example from ancient physics (2400 B.P.), Democritean atoms. Democritus theorized bits of matter so small
            in factbut alsoin principleto be too small to be humanly perceived. Yet he went on to hypothesize that their shapes werecausesof our perceptions. Thus smooth round shapes caused sweet tastes, while barbed ones caused bitter. From today's technologically embodied science we have now overcome his limitations with scanning, tunneling electronic microscopes and now know, recently, that two-atom-thick carbon films can be arranged into thirteen different multistable forms through imaging of the atoms. Thus, using the vocabulary of modernist realism, we could conclude that Democritean atoms never existed, or using the vocabulary of social constructionism, we could say that the ancient “scientific objects—Democritus's atoms” have disappeared to be replaced in the nineteenth century by Rutherfordian mini–solar system atoms and today again replaced by quantum structures. Or we could turn postphenomenological and note that through improved new instrumental technologies, we can now mediatedly “see” the carbon structures noted. What has changed with both Democritus and Rutherford are lifeworlds in which objects, knowledge production, and human–world interrelationships have been superseded.<br>

Article Title: Ethics and Religion in Continental Philosophy<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: jspecphil.26.2.issue-2<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: Interestingly, we have reached a curious state of déjà vu. If SPEP was very much the work of John Wild, and if Wild followed a trajectory from realism to phenomenology, we are today seeing a movement in reverse, from phenomenology back to realism. Furthermore the later theological turn, almost predictable from the implicit theological beginnings of Continental philosophy, has occasioned a turn toward an antireligion, toward a new atheism, a new modernism, and a new materialism, reminiscent of the debates about scientific realism when Wilfrid Sellars presented his views on the manifest image and the scientific image in the early years of SPEP. The new movement has gathered around Quentin Meillassoux's
            After Finitude.
                  Meillassoux, a student of Badiou's, makes two charges. First is “correlationism”: Continental philosophy from Kant to the present is inherently subjectivistic and antirealist and makes nonsense of modern science (the premise that provoked the Alan Sokal ruse).26
               
                  The villain of the piece is Kant's perversion of the Copernican Revolution, wherein Kant reinstated the very anthropocentrism destroyed by Copernicus. Second is “fideism”: when Kant said that he found it necessary to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith, he laid the ground for the theological turn. He invented the God of the gaps. He turned philosophy into a kind of apologetics that delimits the natural sciences and leaves the barn door wide open, through which theology makes an easy escape. Phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction are just so many versions of Kantian idealism under another name, constituting the dark damp soil in which the poisonous mushrooms of theology take root. If the theological turn is where Continental philosophy leads us, the young critics seem to say, that is the last straw, its reductio ad absurdum!27<br>

Abstract: Such vulnerability to assault raises questions of ethics that are central to the next section, entitled “Ethics and Reciprocity in Heidegger and Beauvoir.” Julie Kuhlken's article, “Heidegger and Aristotle: Action, Production, and Ethos,” considers Heidegger's practical philosophy, as expressed in his “Letter on Humanism,” in relation to his lectures on Aristotle from the 1920s. Through a discussion of Heidegger's distinctions between action and effecting and between ethics and ethos, Kuhlken argues that Heidegger's practical philosophy focuses less on ethics as it is typically understood today and more on the ancient notion of the good life. In “The Other (Woman): Limits of Knowledge in Beauvoir's Ethics of Reciprocity,” Ellie Anderson reassesses Beauvoir's ethics of reciprocity through a reading of her 1943 novel
      She Came to Stay. Anderson argues, against prominent readers of Beauvoir such as Penelope Deutscher and Debra Bergoffen, that central to Beauvoir's ethics is the recognition of the irreducible otherness or radical alterity of the other—and thus of a fundamental epistemic gap between self and other.<br>

Abstract: First, hermeneutics rejects the scientific ideal of phenomenology. Husserl conceives phenomenology in foundational terms as a first philosophy whose role is to provide a metaphysical grounding or an Archimedean point for scientific knowledge. But hermeneutics challenges the foundational enterprise altogether.
         
               The search for foundations, on this view, is forgetful of its own origins within a more encompassing context of relations. Thought can never establish itself at the beginning or end point; instead it is always situated in medias res, that is, in the midst of a conversation or dialogue that has already begun.12<br>

Abstract: In this work, I argue that creative metaphors are formed when some persistent problem, caused by an inadequacy in preexisting knowledge, descends into the collective unconscious, is reconfigured unconsciously in novel ways, and then reemerges back into consciousness where the impasse is resolved by the metaphorical expression of new knowledge. To develop this position, I (1) review and critique some well-known language-based studies of metaphor, (2) summarize psychoanalytic and depth psychological approaches to the psyche as one way to overcome the shortcomings of the language-based scholarship, (3) relate C. G. Jung's account of the psyche and his related notion of synchronicity to creative metaphors, (4) graft a quantum physics approach to material reality back onto Jung's work as a provisional structure of the collective unconscious, and finally, (5) offer some suggestions about how creative metaphors might work psychologically.<br>

Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: philrhet.45.4.issue-4<br>
Date: 12 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: More than a simple and obvious trope, hyperbole is a perspective that allows one to view the world otherwise through the use of excess and exaggeration. It is a mode of thought, a practice of excess, and an act of becoming. It can operate discursively, polemically, prophetically, paradoxically, and philosophically. It is a generator of meaning and being and a lens through which to view the world and the limits of knowledge differently. It is a disruptive force within language that always attempts to move beyond the insufficiency of thought and language while at the same time revealing the errant multiplicity and exorbitance of discourse through the abundance of excess. Hyperbole is a different kind of speech; through it a lie that is not a deception can be employed on the side of truth(s), which is always lacking and unstable, necessitating the abundance of excess.<br>

Abstract: When one examines this moment of prefiguration against the background of Ricoeur's other work, it becomes evident that the preunderstanding of action relates closely to his concept of
         doxa. Literary and rhetorical scholar Andreea Deciu Ritivoi explains that this concept traditionally has been defined as “the domain of probable knowledge and contrasted toepisteme, the realm of certainty.”Doxahas also been used to describe the “sets of beliefs widely espoused by particular audiences” (Ritivoi2006, 50). This second sense pertains most directly to Ricoeur's notion of prefiguration.
               Like many rhetorical scholars, philosopher Ricoeur sees8
            doxaas a central concept in the rhetorical tradition. Indeed, he argues thatdoxa, “the sedimented universe of conventional ideas,” constitutes the “premises of rhetorical argumentation” (1997, 66). All rhetors, he explains, build their persuasive discourses on conventional ideas they believe their audiences accept. Ricoeur thus argues thatdoxaserves an integrating, socially conservative function (1997, 60–64).<br>

Abstract: In this connection, two additional Ricoeurian points are worth emphasizing. First, Shaw does not present incontestable evidence to warrant his assertion that we exit the womb untarnished. And there is a good reason for this omission. No such corroboration exists, either in speculative thought or actual experience. Shaw knows this, even if he does not explicitly cite Kant on the limits of human knowledge. For this reason, he couches his deepest feelings about the sanctity of creation and the purity of nascence in terms of a “frame of reference”
         
               —what we may call faith—without which our lives could easily be an endless nightmare of unrelieved pessimism. Shaw may enlist Paley and the elaborate inner workings of the famous watch to proffer the notion that there is a designer behind all of the intricate design we see in nature, but he is well aware that while argument by analogy is suggestive, it is not necessarily irrefutable.48
            
               After all, given enough time, the counterargument goes, blind chance could have achieved the exact same results many are anxious to attribute to divine intelligence. For Shaw, then, the extrapolated likeness between the maker of a timepiece and the maker of a universe, with respect to complexity, organization, and purpose, does not constitute a rigorous proof. Nevertheless, it does provide him with sufficient grounds for a rational belief in things unseen. Shaw designates his ethereal architect the Life Force and equates it with Will, Spirit, and the mainspring of life, Creative Evolution. On this faith-based view, Shaw defines the Life Force and its ends as the paramount “good” in the ethical sense and conceives every newborn as similarly good because it comes into being already gifted with a subset of the same Will, Spirit, and Creativity that animates the world. From this angle, we can justifiably say that both Ricoeur and Shaw ground their abiding faith and the hope that flows from it in t~<br>

Issue: style.34.issue-2<br>
Date: 6 1, 1987<br>
Author(s): Carrard Philippe<br>
Abstract: In the current rhetoric and epistemology of historiography, the issue is no longer to know whether narrative provides a legitimate mode of knowledge. It is to determine whether historians use narrative, and—if they do not—what alternative modes of discourse they may be employing. The examination of a specific corpus: studies published about the period of the German occupation in France, shows that historians now rely on different types of textual organization. While they still use at times a straight, linear type of narrative, they increasingly turn to genres that are low in narrativity or even devoid of it. Eschewing narrative, however, seems reserved for academic historians; story-telling still prevails in “popular” history. Furthermore, the classification offered here depends on a narrow definition of “narrative”; a more inclusive definition would admit more texts under the category “narrative,” thus producing a different taxonomy.<br>

Publisher: Cambridge UP<br>
Issue: style.36.issue-1<br>
Date: February 25, 1984<br>
Author(s): Alber Jan<br>
Abstract: In
         Towards a ‘Natural’ Narratology(1996), Monika Fludernik reconstitutes narrativity on the basis of experientiality, i.e., humanity's embodiedness in the world, and claims that incomprehensible texts can be made more readable if one attempts to narrativize them. Since Samuel Beckett's short prose work “Lessness” is one of the most enigmatic texts of the twentieth century, it serves as an ideal test case for this new narratological paradigm. “Lessness” does indeed lose its initial strangeness if one reads this piece as narrative. Moreover, although a “natural” narratological analysis paves the way for a new interpretation of “Lessness,” the new paradigm provides only a partially satisfying analysis of it. To make the text fit into the new consciousness-oriented paradigm, Fludernik's quasi-universal naturalizing mode has to ignore certain aspects such as the mechanical structure of “Lessness.” Beckett's later prose work challenges narrativization and the “natural” narratological project. A reading of “Lessness” should be liberated from the confines of experientiality and instead concentrate on the role of chance and chaos. Beckett's text must be located in a counterworld, a limbo between signifier and signified. One should allow this limbo world to seep into the “real world” and not attempt to explain this different counterworld by means of “real-world” knowledge.<br>

Author(s): Marcus Amit<br>
Abstract: Most scholars dealing with unreliable narration consider the unreliable narrator inferior to the reader in either knowledge or morality. This conception implies that the readers are more reliable than the unreliable narrator and, thanks to this difference, capable of identifying unreliabilty, with no consequences or ramifications for themselves. Although this view is not entirely wrong, the readers' superiority to the narrator may change if the readers either find out new details about the narrator that urge them to reevaluate their classification or discover something new about themselves that encourages them to reconsider their superiority. An interesting combination of these two possibilities is found in Camus's novella
         The Fall(La Chute). My interpretation ofThe Fallfocuses on the triad narrator-narratee-reader and the narrator's rhetorical manipulations, maintaining that the text both undermines the binary opposition between “unreliable narrator” and “reliable reader” and has some general implications on the position of the reader towards fiction.<br>

Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: I am not the first to give a rhetorical reading to Mannheim. Paul Ricoeur, in
         Lectures on Ideology and Utopia, also offers a reinterpretation of Mannheim's concept that makes it seem part of rhetorical theory. For Ricoeur, the function of utopia is criticism of systems of authority rather than change itself. Ideology, then, would function to legitimize systems of authority, and utopia would function to challenge systems of authority. At its best, utopia could offer possibilities for the future, but at its worst it would be the unrealizable vision, merely an escape from reality into illusion or fantasy.
               Ricoeur adds a dimension that is particularly attractive to the rhetorician: the screen of symbolic reality rather than only what is materially real and unmediated. This addition would seem to confirm that Ricoeur sees utopia as a type of rhetoric. In particular, his concept of utopia is relevant to the interpretive function of rhetorical theory. The critic cannot exist outside of historical progress (which involves ideology), but to engage in criticism at all one must presume what is utopian—the viewpoint of what is ideal for humankind.22
            
               Mannheim also makes clear in23
            Ideology and Utopiathat utopia can only be seen as an interpretation of historical events. This is because he sees knowledge as partial and dependent on the social location of the observer—a condition that his idea of utopia shares with contemporary understandings of the rhetorical situation (the social and temporal locations of the rhetor and the audience).<br>

Abstract: Jacques Derrida has suggested that God is that which sees everything and yet which cannot be seen: “He holds me in his gaze … while remaining inaccessible to me”
         
               —for, as God explains to Moses in Exodus 33:20, no one may see him and live. Utopias remain similarly invisible (yet envisionable); they supersede contemporary epistemologies. Francis Bacon—a writer for whom knowledge, of course, was power—therefore writes that his New Atlantians “know well most part of the habitable world, and are … unknown”—“they … knew much of our state … yet we … never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island.”10
            
               This, adds Bacon, is “a conditioner and propriety of divine powers and beings, to be hidden and unseen to others, and yet to have others open and as in a light to them.”11
            
               In this respect, the Utopian mode might be seen to resemble the work, at once omnisciently encyclopedic and frustratingly obscurantist, of James Joyce.12<br>

Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: As a fundamentally transdisciplinary field of knowledge, utopian studies places great demands on scholars who attempt to do justice to the body of knowledge out of which the field is constructed, without doing violence to whatever other fields of knowledge are placed in proximity to it—in the instance of the essays that follow, architecture and urbanism, including diverse considerations of history, theory, and design. By the same token, as we all pretty much play out our lives in designed and constructed environments, it can be all too easy to presume a depth of understanding about architecture that is generally premature, at least if the aim is to do justice to architecture and urbanism as interrelated disciplines bound up with giving shape to the spaces of intimate and social interaction, which simultaneously struggle with ethical and aesthetical demands that can often appear to be at cross-purposes to one another, to such an extent that a tug-of-war arguably exists between them. Resolving this struggle and mastering architecture and Utopia simultaneously in the development of the arguments that follow are surely revealed as an exceedingly taxing endeavor.<br>

Abstract: Characterizing the slipstream genre, Bruce Sterling locates it between mainstream and science fiction; it “sets its face against consensus reality” and makes us feel “very strange.” A strong slipstream candidate is Steven Hall’s
         The Raw Shark Texts(2007). Manifesting as a distributed literary system, the text has as its core a print novel, but other internet and real world sites also contain fragments or “negatives.” One of the text’s two villains, Mycroft Ward, has transformed into an online database; a posthuman subjectivity, he appropriates “node bodies” that upload their information and download new instructions. This separation of content (online database) from form (node body) is, according to Alan Liu, one of the primary characteristics of postindustrial knowledge work. To this extent, Hall positions his narrative not only against databases but also against knowledge that is, in Liu’s terms, autonomously mobile, transformable, and automated, having lost its material instantiation and been pulverized into atomized bits of information. The text’s second villain—a “conceptual shark,” the Ludovician—represents the complete fusion of form and content; the typographical symbols used to describe the shark also comprise its flesh in verbal and graphic representations. The text thus positions its protagonist, Eric Sanderson, as caught between twenty-first-century forms of knowledge and the implosion of signifier into signified. In this sense, the novel functions as a parable for the contemporary human condition, looking toward a posthuman future but incarnated within an ancient biological heritage.<br>

Article Title: “Terminus.”<br>

Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
