  Horses, Mourning: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1c6v89n">Mourning Animals</a><br>
  Author(s) ARGENT GALA<br>
  Abstract: Some 2400 years ago, people belonging to the Iron Age Pazyryk archaeological culture gathered together to lay their dead to rest in burial mounds in the remote Inner Asian Altai Mountains. At these funerals, they sacrificed elaborately costumed riding horses and carefully buried them alongside the deceased (figure 1). While typical burials of this age present only metal and bone for analysis, here the graves subsequently froze in permafrost, preserving wood, leather, fabric, and often the entire bodies of the humans and horses. These unusual burials thus provide an excellent opportunity for exploring the particular connections between these people and<br>

  [PART 3. Introduction] from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.14321/j.ctt1d10hh7">Rethinking Rhetorical Theory, Criticism, and Pedagogy</a><br>
  Abstract: “In Search of Ariadne’s Thread” shows how Leff’s understanding of the classical tradition made him sympathetic to, yet critical of, the changes occurring in the field in the 1970s. Leff’s mixed response to these changes as a historian of rhetoric is interesting in its own right. More impressive, however, is how persistently he sought to work through the complexities of his response through elaborating (and continually modifying) his own “theory” of rhetorical criticism—close reading.<br>

  Author(s) Mohrmann G. P.<br>
  Abstract: The last issue of this journal included our critique of Lincoln’s Cooper Union Address, and we assume that the neo-classical origins of the analysis were apparent, even though methodological concerns were slighted. A more elaborate statement on methodology appeared in an earlier version, but the editors cautioned that the single article did not offer sufficient scope for both an explication of the rationale and its application. Accepting their advice, we deleted most of the theoretical material, but having offered the critique, we want to explore further its theoretical bases.<br>

  Abstract: In a short story entitled ʺThe Lost Civilization of Deli,ʺ raconteur Jean Shepherd projects a future world where archaeologists excavate the ruins of the great North American culture of ʺFun City,ʺ known previously as New York. Deep in the remains of a skyscraper the archaeologists exhume the dusty contents of a gray metal vault, perhaps a sacred burial site. The interior of the vault reveals row upon row of reels wound with celluloid and labeled in small script, ʺTV 60 Second Commercials.ʺ Months later the scientists determine in a laboratory that the films were strangely imprinted with images of special<br>

  Book Title: Symposium of the Whole-A Range of Discourse Toward an Ethnopoetics<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Rothenberg Diane<br>
  Abstract: Symposium of the Wholetraces a discourse on poetry and culture that has profoundly influenced the art of our time, with precedents going back two centuries and more. Beginning with a reassertion of the complexity of poetry among peoples long labeled "primitive" and "savage," many recent poets have sought to base a new poetics over the fullest range of human cultures. The attempt to define an ethnopoetics has been significantly connected with the most experimental and future-directed side of Romantic and modern poetry, both in the Western world and, increasingly, outside it. As a visionary poetics and as a politics, this complex redefinition of cultural and intellectual values has involved a rarely acknowledged collaboration between poets and scholars, who together have challenged the narrow view of literature that has excluded so many traditions.In this gathering, the Rothenbergs follow the idea of an ethnopoetics from predecessors such as Vico, Blake, Thoreau, and Tzara to more recent essays and manifestos by poets and social thinkers such as Olson, Eliade, Snyder, Turner, and Baraka. The themes range widely, from the divergence of oral and written cultures to the shaman as proto-poet and the reemergence of suppressed and rejected forms and images: the goddess, the trickster, and the "human universe." The book's three ethnographic sections demonstrate how various poetries are structured and composed, how they reflect meaning and worldview, and how they are performed in cultures where all art may be thought of as art-in-motion.Among the poetries discussed are the language of magic; West African drum language and poetry; the Huichol Indian language of reversals; chance operations in African divination poetry; picture-writings and action-writings from Australia and Africa; and American Indian sacred-clown dramas and traditional trickster narratives. The cumulative effect is a new reading of the poetic past and present-in the editors' words, "a changed paradigm of what poetry was or now could come to be."<br>

  Talking to Discover from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1bmzkq4">Symposium of the Whole</a><br>
  Author(s) ANTIN DAVID<br>
  Abstract: As an early participant in the ethnopoetic discussion, David Antin has explored a radically ʺnewʺ source for poetry in speech and discourse. This has involved, as here, a tension with the idea of poetryʹs origins in song, and an intensification, touched on in the pieces that follow and elsewhere in this book, of the old dichotomy between the oral and the written. Antinʹs own poetry over the last decade has taken a form sometimes indistinguishable from ʺtalkingʺ per se, culminating in an ongoing series of written and elaborated poem-transcriptions. (See below, p. 469.) His principal works in this genre are<br>

  Author(s) Allden Kathleen<br>
  Abstract: This chapter describes the suffering and hardship of several villagers from Burma who are now refugees in Thailand. Their life experiences reflect the large population of villagers whose families were forced to leave their homes and villages to make way for the construction of a natural gas pipeline in the Tenasserim region of Burma by US and French transnational oil companies in collaboration with the Burmese military government (

  Abstract: In the late 1930s, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead did pioneering ethnographic fieldwork in a Balinese village, using still and movie cameras to capture some of the “intangible aspects” of Balinese culture and everyday life, including trance, eating, gesture, mourning, family interactions, children’s play, art, and shadow-play puppets. In her introductory essay to their 1942 monograph, Mead speaks of a Balinese passion for being part of a noisy, festive crowd. Whether a marketplace, temple court, theatrical event, elaborate carving, or close-packed array of offerings on an altar, “the crowd preference is seen everywhere in Balinese life.¹ Women are said to<br>

  Abstract: Science and technology are integral to the definition of reality and to the restructuring of power relations and bodily experience. In
                  The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt argues that in the course of the twentieth century, political action has increasingly focused on the control of natural life and on the fabrication of automatons.¹ Thehomo fabergave way to thehomo laborans—that is, people became ever more involved in mass production and were most concerned with physiological existence. Scientific practices have been central to this transformation. Arendt argues that the experimental process that came to define the natural sciences—″the<br>

  Book Title: Carnal Thoughts-Embodiment and Moving Image Culture<br>
  Publisher: University of California Press<br>
  Author(s): Sobchack Vivian<br>
  Abstract: In these innovative essays, Vivian Sobchack considers the key role our bodies play in making sense of today's image-saturated culture. Emphasizing our corporeal rather than our intellectual engagements with film and other media,
      Carnal Thoughtsshows how our experience always emerges through our senses and how our bodies are not just visible objects but also sense-making, visual subjects. Sobchack draws on both phenomenological philosophy and a broad range of popular sources to explore bodily experience in contemporary, moving-image culture. She examines how, through the conflation of cinema and surgery, we've all "had our eyes done"; why we are "moved" by the movies; and the different ways in which we inhabit photographic, cinematic, and electronic space.Carnal Thoughtsprovides a lively and engaging challenge to the mind/body split by demonstrating that the process of "making sense" requires an irreducible collaboration between our thoughts and our senses.<br>

  Abstract: In Vietnam, household death-commemoration rites are a rich store of historical evidence. Numerous incidents from past wars are faithfully recorded in these rites, even though the archives and monuments may carry no trace of these incidents. On several occasions, including in the late 1980s and again in the late 1990s, village administrations in the provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai collaborated with researchers from the provincial Communist Party on a survey of wartime casualties. They uncovered many previously unknown incidents, but these surveys left out as many cases as they revealed. People tended to report only the incidents of<br>

  THREE  Ethical Caring and Obligation from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp657">The Maternal Factor</a><br>
  Abstract: In this chapter, we’ll discuss the move from natural caring to ethical caring. We’ll also take a close look at caregiving—long defined as “woman’s work.” Carework is both the incubator of natural caring and a current site of contention. On one hand, it represents the set of activities in which females have developed an enhanced capacity for empathy. On the other, society’s expectation that women will continue to do the lion’s share of care labor is a legacy of the second source of female empathy—subordination.<br>

  NINE  Convergence from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp657">The Maternal Factor</a><br>
  Abstract: Throughout this book, I’ve been exploring caring, morality, and the development of an ethic of care from their roots in maternal instinct. However, I have not claimed that there is only one evolutionary path to morality. Morality has long been defined by some in terms of God’s word. Obviously, there is also the well-known and well-trodden path from original self-interest. Men have learned that fairness and cooperation often increase their own chances of survival, and that train of thought has led to elaborate (and sometimes competing) systems of moral thought. I have argued that these traditional systems frequently go too<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pp75p">Gadamer’s Repercussions</a><br>
  Author(s) Gaiger Jason<br>
  Abstract: On February 11, 1995, Gadamer reached the age of ninety-five. The tributes that were paid to him were justifiably numerous; in the
                  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitunghe was celebrated as “the most successful philosopher of the Federal Republic,” placed even before Jürgen Habermas, to whom the title of philosopher was awarded only with certain reservations.¹ The worldwide influence of Gadamer’s thinking is closely connected with the reception of his principal work,Truth and Method(1960). In 1979, Habermas characterized Gadamer’s achievement as the “urbanization of the Heideggerian province.” The bridges that Gadamer has built consist above all in an elaboration of<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1pphf4">Being There</a><br>
  Author(s) Borneman John<br>
  Abstract: This essay examines the relation of presence in fieldwork to interlocution. Within anthropology in the past several decades, two kinds of criticisms of the fieldwork encounter have had particular resonance: that fieldwork experience and presence do not generate any unique knowledge and that the power/dominance of the (Western) ethnographer ethically taints the knowledge derived from encounters. The questioning of the ethnographer’s presence has frequently led to text-based reading being substituted for fieldwork experience, with a corresponding focus on textual representation; the questioning of the ethnographer’s power has led to demands for collaboration and dialogue, which in turn often emphasize righteous<br>

  Abstract: In 2004, Raʾūf ʿAbbās, one of Egypt’s leading historians, published his autobiography. This memoir, ostensibly a pedestrian intellectual autobiography of a retired history professor, proved instead to be a frontal assault on Egypt’s entire historiographical establishment. The author spared no one: neither the stars of Egypt’s academic elite nor the lowliest graduate student escaped the lashing of his pen. Over the course of 336 crowded pages, he accused his colleagues of poor academic standards, plagiarism, intellectual shallowness, ethical violations, political partisanship, and collaboration with the state’s security services. His many anecdotes ranged from the selling of academic degrees to rich<br>

  Abstract: What has been elaborated here is the history of perhaps the most powerful and enduring of the “strong misreadings” (to use Harold Bloom’s term) that make up our cultural heritage. I have avoided any attempt to hold that reading of Homer up against others, to affirm or to deny it, beyond occasional observations on analogies between these ancient interpretive critics and those of our own time. My reticence on this score reveals an implicit model of reading with similarities to Bloom’s, and no doubt in part derivative from it.

  Abstract: People have always been fascinated by evil—by that which harms us or threatens to harm us. Primitive people sought to escape evil by magic, ritual, and appeasement. Philosophers have attempted to redeem evil by elaborate analyses designed to show that evil is somehow necessary, and theologians have produced a body of work on the “problem of evil.” Women have until recently been relatively silent on evil, in part because they have been silent on most matters, but largely because they have themselves been closely identified with evil in the traditional view.

  Book Title: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges-Men and Women of Valor<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Yoder John C.<br>
  Abstract: Power and Politics in the Book of Judges studies political culture and behavior in premonarchic Israel, focusing on the protagonists in the book of Judges. Although the sixth-century BCE Deuteronomistic editor portrayed them as moral champions and called them “judges,” the original bardic storytellers and the men and women of valor themselves were preoccupied with the problem of gaining and maintaining political power. These “mighty ones” were ambitious, at times ruthless; they might be labeled chiefs, strongmen, or even warlords in today’s world. John C. Yoder considers the variety of strategies the men and women of valor used to gain and consolidate their power, including the use of violence, the redistribution of patronage, and the control of the labor and reproductive capacity of subordinates. They relied heavily, however, on other strategies that did not deplete their wealth or require the constant exercise of force: mobilizing and dispensing indigenous knowledge, cultivating a reputation for reliability and honor, and positioning themselves as skillful mediators between the realms of earth and heaven, using their association with YHWH to advance their political, economic, or military agenda.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130jd70">Poetry Of Discovery</a><br>
  Abstract: Eladio Cabañero’s background differes considerably from those of the other major poets of his generation. Born and raised in the small town of Tomelloso, Cabañero worked as a laborer in his youth and was largely self-educated when he arrived in Madrid in his late twenties. His early poetry is affected by this background in two different ways. On the one hand it contains many references to farm life and village people and scenes; on the other it is marked by the use of carefully controlled forms and patterns, suggesting the poet’s conscious efforts to learn from and assimilate previous traditions,<br>

  Book Title: God--The World's Future-Systematic Theology for a New Era<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Peters Ted<br>
  Abstract: God—The World’s Future has been a proven and comprehensive textbook in systematic theology for over twenty years. Explicitly crafted to address our postmodern context, Peters explains the whole body of Christian historical doctrine from within a “proleptic” framework, “whereby the gospel is understood as announcing the pre-actualization of the future consummation of all things in Jesus Christ.” Peters skillfully deploys this concept not only to organize the various theological areas or loci but also to rethink doctrines in light of key postmodern challenges from ecumenism, critical historical thinking, contemporary science, and gender and sexuality issues. The Third Edition is thoroughly revised with updated chapters, additional chapters, updated annotations and bibliographies, and further elaborations in light of recent developments in method and theological reflection. This classic text opens up systematic theology in new dimensions, retrieving traditional categories and topics for a new generation of students and learners to give a fresh reading of Christian theology and articulation of the liberating message of the gospel of God’s grace for the future of the world.<br>

  Abstract: For kabbalists in the late Middle Ages, in consonance with contemporaneous patterns of Christian and Islamic piety but especially the former, the body was a site of tension, the locus of sensual and erotic pleasure on the one hand, and the earthly pattern of God’s image, the representation of what lies beyond representation, the mirror that renders visible the invisible, on the other. Given the intractable state of human consciousness as embodied—not to be understood, as I will elaborate below, along the lines of Cartesian dualism of mind/body but rather in Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenological sense of the embodied mind/mindful body—<br>

In this book, I have once again labored long in the orchard of kabbalistic texts to articulate philosophically the poetic imagination and hermeneutic orientation of the medieval Jewish esoteric lore. In great measure, my effort herein, reflective of my scholarly project since I began graduate school in 1980, has been impelled by a keen sense that kabbalah—not to speak of the spiritual comportment of Judaism more generally—<br>

  Abstract: Modern capitalism in the 1960 s and 1970 s was called late capitalism, and this index of time—the word “late”—implied that modern capitalism, with free markets of labor, real estate, and money, had come to an end. Its final decay was supposed to be only a question of time, political power, and successful regime change. During the 1960 s and 1970 s, the leftist alternative seemed to be clear and present. The variety of socialist alternatives was overwhelming: Grassroots democracy, democratization of the economy, a strong social welfare state, state or market socialism, but socialism (or social democracy)<br>

Originally from Ireland, Kearney worked closely with Ricoeur, Lévinas, and Derrida in France (he received his doctorate there under Ricoeur’s direction) and has taught in the United States for several decades. Over the years, he has labored vigorously to establish communication and conversation between many of the thinkers treated in this book (in various interviews, roundtable discussions, and other venues), but has himself also contributed significantly to the discussion of religious phenomenology and hermeneutics.

  Abstract: The four realities referred to in the title of my essay—namely, identity, belonging, diversity, and pluralism in religious matters—when combined together and placed in the North American context, present both challenges and opportunities for the Christian church and its theology.

  Author(s) OLTHUIS JAMES<br>
  Abstract: Richard Kearney is a possibility thinker, a philosopher, novelist, and poet fired by a passion for/of God. For Kearney, philosophy links imagination and affectivity with reason in a rhetoric of persuasion aiming for individual and societal transfiguration. In other words, as I read him, philosophy is not an abstract-theoretical exercise dedicated to getting things straight, finding solutions for particular theoretic problems. Rather, for Kearney, philosophy is a way of life, a spiritual exercise¹ working toward the incitement of passion for visionary transformation and cultural change rather than the elaboration of grand systems and the elimination of paradoxes.

Geneticists can enhance the DNA of almost any living creature, including human beings. Cloning is a reality, no longer just the stuff of science fiction. New genetic engineering and organ transplantation technologies raise legal questions about the ownership of one’s own DNA and one’s own body.

  Book Title: Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Mieszkowski Jan<br>
  Abstract: This book is a major new study of the doctrines of productivity and interest in Romanticism and classical political economy. The author argues that the widespread contemporary embrace of cultural historicism and the rejection of nineteenth-century conceptions of agency have hindered our study of aesthetics and politics. Focusing on the difficulty of coordinating paradigms of intellectual and material labor, Mieszkowski shows that the relationship between the imagination and practical reason is crucial to debates about language and ideology.From the Romantics to Poe and Kafka, writers who explore Kant's claim that poetry sets the imagination freediscover that the representational and performative powers of language cannot be explained as the products of a self-governing dynamic, whether formal or material. A discourse that neither reflects nor prescribes the values of its society, literature proves to be a uniquely autonomous praxis because it undermines our reliance on the concept of interest as the foundation of self-expression or self-determination. Far from compromising its political significance, this turns literature into the condition of possibility of freedom. For Smith, Bentham, and Marx, the limits of self-rule as a model of agency prompt a similar rethinking of the relationship between language and politics. Their conception of a linguistic labor that informs material praxis is incompatible with the liberal ideal of individualism. In the final analysis, their work invites us to think about social conflicts not as clashes between competing interests, but as a struggle to distinguish human from linguistic imperatives.<br>

  Abstract: Throughout his oeuvre, Kant focuses on the uncertain relations between universal principles and singular events that threaten to confound the elaboration of a comprehensive model of the mind. One of the central concepts in his account of the (dis)equilibrium of the self is interest, a term that appears at crucial moments in the three
                  Critiques, but whose very ubiquity has tended to divert attention from its importance. “All my reason’s interest (speculative as well as practical),” explains Kant in theCritique of Pure Reason, “is united in the following three questions: What can I know? What ought I to do?<br>

  Conclusion from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x0d6g">Labors of Imagination: Aesthetics and Political Economy from Kant to Althusser</a><br>
  Abstract: In this book, I have argued that reading the texts of classical political economy together with post-Kantian literature offers us important insights into some of the central controversies of contemporary cultural theory. Ideological debates in the humanities will benefit immeasurably once we recognize that philosophical inquiry is not a hindrance to but an essential ally of empirical history. As Adorno frequently reminded us, the attempt to renounce all pretensions to subjective expression and surrender oneself to the objective authority of what exists (or has existed) is no less likely to lapse into idealism than the most detailed elaboration of self-reflexive<br>

  Book Title: Written Voices, Spoken Signs-Tradition, Performance, and the Epic Text<br>
  Publisher: Harvard University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAHANE AHUVIA<br>
  Abstract: These innovative essays by leading scholars of Homer, oral poetics, and epic invite us to rethink some key concepts for an understanding of traditional epic poetry. Egbert Bakker examines the epic performer's use of time and tense in recounting a past that is alive. Tackling the question of full-length performance of the monumental
         Iliad, Andrew Ford considers the extent to which the work was perceived as a coherent whole in the archaic age. John Miles Foley addresses questions about spoken signs and the process of reference in epic discourse, and Ahuvia Kahane studies rhythm as a semantic factor in the Homeric performance. Richard Martin suggests a new range of performance functions for the Homeric simile. And Gregory Nagy establishes the importance of one feature of epic language, the ellipsis. These six essays centered on Homer engage with fundamental issues that are addressed by three essays primarily concerned with medieval epic: those by Franz BÃƒÂ¤uml on the concept of fact; by Wulf Oesterreicher on types of orality; and by Ursula Schaefer on written and spoken media. In their Introduction the editors highlight the underlying approach and viewpoints of this collaborative volume.Reviews of this book:"Despite its wide range of topics and approaches, the volume has a clear thematic focus. All contributors seek to leave behind the more formal concerns of past generations of scholars and aim instead at an understanding of orality as that which is (conceptually or actually) close, immediate, or performed. In their joint search for the new picture, classicists, linguists, and medievalists discover a range of different 'oralities'."<br>

  Book Title: Jonathan Lethem-  Publisher: Manchester University Press<br>
  Author(s): Peacock James<br>
  Abstract: Jonathan Lethem is the first full-length study dedicated to the work of an exciting, genre-busting contemporary writer with an increasingly high profile in American literature. Examining all of Lethem’s novels, as well as a number of his short fictions, essays and critical works, this study shows how the author’s prolific output, his restlessness and his desire always to be subverting literary forms and genres, are consistent with his interest in subcultural identities. The human need to break off into small groupings, subcultures or miniature utopias is mirrored in the critical tendency to enforce generic boundaries. To break down the boundaries between genres, then, is partly to make a nonsense of critical distinctions between 'high' and 'low' literature, and partly to reflect the wider need to recognise difference, to appreciate that other people, no matter how outlandish and alien they may appear, share similar desires, experiences and problems. With this in mind, James Peacock argues that Lethem’s experiments with genre are not merely games or elaborate literary jokes, but ethical necessities, particularly when viewed in the light of the losses and traumas that shadow all of his writing. Jonathan Lethem, therefore, makes an important contribution not just to Lethem studies, but also to debates about genre and its position in postmodern or 'post-postmodern' literature. It will be of interest to all scholars and students of contemporary American writing, as well as those interested in genre fiction and literature’s relationship with subcultures.<br>

  YOU SHALL NEVER KILL from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16f8cb0">Thou Shalt Not Kill: A Political and Theological Dialogue</a><br>
  Abstract: In 1984, delivering a speech commemorating peace in Europe, Emmanuel Lévinas underlines how the West lacks “a sensibility in which the scandal of murder is not suppressed even when the violence is rationally necessary.”¹ If the vitalist mask of the subject holds war inevitable and even healthy, the rationalist mask holds it all the more necessary to secure peace. Intuiting that the two masks demonstrate a substantial complicity and distrusting an idea of peace that continues to be based on war, Lévinas elaborates a radical critique of violence that is based on an atypical reading of the sixth commandment—or,<br>

  Abstract: La actividad científica en las ciencias sociales no sólo se enfrenta a las dificultades y complejidades que su labor impone, sino también cuando se trata de elegir métodos y técnicas apropiados para abordar, interpretar y explicar la realidad social. Aun cuando las cuestiones referentes al método son conflictivas y cubren un espectro de temas que van desde las relaciones entre sujeto y objeto, en un plano más general y abstracto involucran hasta el fin mismo de la ciencia; es claro que la adopción de un método particular condiciona con mucho las técnicas de recolección y el análisis de la información<br>

  Author(s) Bancel Nicolas<br>
  Abstract: Black athletes from the French colonies began to appear in metropolitan France in the early twenties.¹ They were represented in the media according to two models: black American champion-athletes, who had become popular in France toward the end of the nineteenth century, and black colonial subjects. The image of the colonial black athlete was elaborated at the intersection of these two imaginaries. However, the progressive stereotyping of these black athletes cannot be reduced exclusively to race. Instead, given the varying contexts in which these stereotypes were produced, their reversible and ever-evolving character, we would do well to consider the different<br>

  Author(s) Dewitte Philippe<br>
  Abstract: The 1950s mark a caesura in the manner in which sub-S aharan Africans were perceived in France. After the figure of the “tirailleur as overgrown child” from the interwar years, and before that of the mute and docile “immigrant laborer” from after the independence movements, Africans occupying the center stage in the 1950s were politicians, intellectuals, artists, students, and more. They helped to modify the image of Africans in the French unconscious, even if old stereotypes, born from the paternalism and racism of the colonial era, did not entirely disappear.

  Author(s) Einaudi Jean-Luc<br>
  Abstract: Over the course of imperial history, colonial violence in France has been primarily anti-Algerian. This can in part be explained by the scale of Algerian immigration to the metropole. Officially, more than 250,000 Algerians were living in France in the early 1950s, mainly in greater Paris, though also in the northeast and in the cities of Marseille and lyon. Most were factory workers and unskilled laborers who worked in the metalworking or chemical industries, in construction, public works, and mines. Also, of course, many were unemployed. Another reason for anti-Algerian sentiment was the fact that this labor immigration was organized<br>

  Abstract: A collaborative book published in 2005,

  Abstract: Children are of obvious importance to farmers in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco, as the main source of farm labor and as a preeminent cultural value. Villagers expect to have children, pity those who do not, ask about having them, pray to have them, and consider any equivocation about the desirability of parenthood to be a weird misunderstanding or a form of mental illness. For most of my time in Morocco, I was a researcher without children, so I existed in kind of bizarre, liminal state. I had the material resources and apparent capabilities of a man, but I<br>

  Abstract: Whereas the previous chapter elaborated what might be thought of as a destiny to which we must be answerable, I now turn to another, more active face of skepticism or sin, namely violence. What is the connection between violence and my relation to the other? How can the motives behind violence be understood, and how is it entangled with religion? Levinas’s understanding of how violence is bound up with the face of the other provides a rich phenomenological account, one that I believe can be supplemented with Cavell’s subtle understanding of its motivation.<br>

  CONCLUSION: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt16gz98c">Stanley Cavell, Religion, and Continental Philosophy</a><br>
  Abstract: In this book I have tried to elaborate the analogies and overlappings between Cavell’s philosophy and his religious perspective, either expressed philosophically or theologically. If such an undertaking might be deemed risky, it is because of Cavell’s own repeated resistance toward certain Christian depictions of the human state as helpless, fixed, awaiting supernatural aid, pursuing untimely theologizing, and the like. This resistance has been emphasized by his commentators and has often been taken as Cavell’s prevalent attitude. Especially in chapter 1 but also in the subsequent chapters, I have tried to oppose such interpretations—not because they are wrong (indeed,<br>

  Book Title: Gadamer-A Philosophical Portrait<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): Keane Niall<br>
  Abstract: Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900-2002), one of the towering figures of contemporary Continental philosophy, is best known for Truth and Method, where he elaborated the concept of "philosophical hermeneutics," a programmatic way to get to what we do when we engage in interpretation. Donatella Di Cesare highlights the central place of Greek philosophy, particularly Plato, in Gadamer's work, brings out differences between his thought and that of Heidegger, and connects him with discussions and debates in pragmatism. This is a sensitive and thoroughly readable philosophical portrait of one of the 20th century's most powerful thinkers.<br>

  Abstract: “This universal
                  a prioriof correlation between experienced object and manners of givenness,” Husserl confided two years before his death, “affected me so deeply that my whole subsequent life-work has been dominated by the task of systematically elaborating on thisa prioriof correlation.”¹ The discovery of this universal a priori, which is none other than that of intentionality, signifies that every being, whatever its meaning, points toward a subjective system of lived experiences; that every being, whatever its region of origin, is the object of a consciousness, or again that its objectivity is phenomenality itself. Thus the intentional analysis<br>

  Abstract: If the recent passage of the Columbus quincentennary has posed for us any new questions, one of them surely has to do with the relationships among the various cultures that Columbus’s voyage, or rather our reconstruction of its consequences, has bequeathed to us. For if Columbus’s voyage succeeded in producing anything other than a holocaust to Native peoples, it resulted in an explosion of new cultures in the Americas that has now left us with an elaborate assemblage of societies and nations whose relations with one another, however carefully documented in other terms, are still comparatively unexplored in cultural terms.<br>

  Abstract: Global ethics refers to a diverse field of intellectual inquiry devoted to establishing norms, procedures, and practices for addressing issues of conduct, collaboration, and conflict in the global sphere. Such issues can be of consequence to individuals, communities, states, transnational organizations, or any combination thereof. What makes them global is their sphere of reference and resonance. Do they register on scales of import or signifi-cance and consequence that require interpretation within a global as opposed to a national, transnational, regional, or local frame?<br>

  Abstract: Paul Weiss, founder of the Metaphysical Society of America and of

Shakespeare’s line, “There are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy,” though applicable to many thinkers, seems inappropriate when applied to Weiss. In his own way, Weiss is even more ample than the omnivorous Hegel, who, after all, never elaborated a philosophy of sport. But then again, many seem inclined to reverse Shakespeare’s line in Weiss’s case: “There are more things in Weiss’s philosophy<br>

  Abstract: Instead of stepping on the specialized ground of neuroscience, I wish to elaborate on the specific mental essence of architecture—a realm that is deeply biologically and culturally grounded, although poorly understood in both education and practice. It is my hope that the exciting doors that the biological and neurosciences are now opening will valorize the interaction of architecture and the human mind, and reveal hidden complexities that have thus far escaped measurement and rational analyses. In our postmodern society, dominated by shallow rationality and reliance on the empirical, measurable, and demonstrable, the embodied and mental dimensions of human existence<br>

  Abstract: Ainadamar(“Fountain of Tears,” 2003–05), an opera composed by Osvaldo Golijov in collaboration with librettist David Henry Hwang and director Peter Sellars, initiates the audience into an atmosphere of a bygone era in Spanish history. Over a low electronic drone, murmuring sounds of water are heard, accompanied by a solemn trumpet fanfare that reverberates in the background. Soon, electronic sounds of a galloping horse fill the hall and merge with boisterous rhythms of castanets and cajones (Peruvian drums) played live on stage. When the trumpet fanfare returns, the overture segues to a plaintive ballad sung by the female chorus<br>

                     A Sermon on Keeping Children in School,³ from 1530, contains essentially the same ideas but is a more casual and pastoral piece. After six years, some cities had created schools, following Luther’s proposals. The problem was then parents’ resistance in sending their children to school, as they would lack their labor as workhands. The 1530 treatise is, then, an exhortation to parents to send their children to school.<br>

Instead, conventional wisdom reflects the diviners’ awareness of rivalry, heightened by their clients’ own “jockeying” and “shopping” for a self-interested outcome in the “politics of divination.” Clients do go back and forth from one diviner to another, including Christians using the Bible or with inspiration from the Holy Spirit (Werbner 2011a, chapter 5).

  Abstract: This essay addresses the moral category of evil from an anthropological perspective. For that reason I shall explore “evil” from a particular ontology rather than as a universal concept. This is the only approach that could disclose understandings that may challenge the dominant emic Judeo-Christian theological or philosophical framework. Investigating the manner in which evil is embedded in cosmologies of the everyday, I shall pay attention to practice including discourse as, within this domain, it would only rarely be elaborated in any abstract mode. Furthermore, being attentive to how evil is perceived and identified through its practice renders possible a<br>

  13  CONSTRUCTING MORAL PERSONHOOD: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt17t75bk">Evil in Africa</a><br>
  Author(s) RASMUSSSSEN SUSAN J.<br>
  Abstract: Evil often induces human suffering; it may, for example, result in illness. In many African societies, it is often synonymous with witchcraft, possession, and other malevolent practices elaborated in ritual (Comaroff and Comaroff 1993; Ferme 2001; Rasmussen 1998, 2001; West 2005, 2007), and it is often combated through formal religious and political means. I contend that, in addition to these manifestations, evil may also be addressed more informally, in moral testing during deceptively trivial ordinary everyday sociability, not solely in public formal ritual or large-scale political contexts. Preoccupations in such tests include combating literal physical harm, tangible material theft, and/or<br>

Still, labor, not leisure, structures the vast majority of people’s time. Labor—a word that names both the kind of remunerated work that we do and also how that work<br>

  Abstract: Addressing ambivalence in established categories of colonial art in Mexico, this chapter proposes a “mestizo” category to characterize works of visual art elaborated during the Viceroyalty of New Spain, mainly in the sixteenth century. Those works of interest here are devotional paintings, sculptures, and the doors and façades of a number of architectural complexes, which integrate aesthetic and iconographic elements common to Western European art and pre-Columbian art of Mesoamerica.

Thus, they differ from thequestionsthat are treated by way of syllogisms. Aristotle gives no definition of a topos, but the topoi are referred to as places from where his arguments can be invented, elaborated, or discovered.¹<br>

  Abstract: The conflict between germs and cups first came to my attention in a laboratory at the Indiana Medical History Museum, where I stumbled across an illustration by Hoosier cartoonist Gaar Williams (1880–1935) entitled
                  Meet Me at the Town Pump. Signed, a Typhoid Germ(figure 2.1). In this drawing, a typhoid germ appears as an amphibious creature with webbed hands and feet, sitting at the edge of a wooden tub filled with water. In his right hand is the common dipper or public drinking cup of the day, a single metal can for everyone in the town, attached by chain<br>

  Abstract: La aceleración, las rupturas con el tiempo lineal mediante el avance tecnológico, que comprimen el tiempo y espacio para pasar del “aquí y el ahora” al “ahora en todos los lugares” definen la globalización, (Beriain 1997) como también lo hacen, las circulaciones y flujos de información, de bienes, pero sobre todo, de desplazamientos de fuerza laboral sin distingos de edad o género. Estos flujos humanos sistemáticos, crean verdaderos territorios circulatorios¹ y dislocan la organización social tradicional, las formas, ritmos y rendimiento del trabajo familiar, para ser incorporados a las nuevas formas de producción intensiva, de “flexibilidad laboral”, reguladas según políticas<br>

  Abstract: Las características de migración mundial propician el desplazamiento de niños de un país a otro. La búsqueda de sus padres de mejores oportunidades económicas y laborales conlleva a que ellos queden de manera abrupta inmersos en una sociedad diferente a la de origen donde tendrán que aprender una segunda lengua. De hecho, Kindler (2001) estima que existen aproximadamente 4.6 millones de niños bilingües en las escuelas de Estados Unidos de América (eua), de los cuales alrededor del 79% (3.6 millones) hablan español como primera lengua. Así, al llegar a eua estos niños pronto ingresan a la escuela, la cual, la<br>

  Author(s) Uccelli Paola<br>
  Abstract: El estudio de la narración infantil es de gran importancia por múltiples razones. Al aprender a narrar, los niños aprenden también a interactuar con los adultos y con sus pares; amplían, paso a paso, su conocimiento gramatical y discursivo y van construyendo su propia historia de vida en colaboración con sus padres y otros familiares. Al mismo tiempo, los niños, en general van adquiriendo patrones comunicativos, actitudes y creencias hasta convertirse —la mayoría de las veces— en participantes expertos de las lenguas y culturas con las que se relacionan a diario.<br>

L’utilizzazione indiscriminata, senza limiti e senza preoccupazioni per le conseguenze del nostro operato, dei beni di natura (acqua, aria, terra) che assicurano la vita stessa sul nostro pianeta, la consa­pevolezza di una necessaria autolimitazione dello sviluppo, la crisi della società industriale e le difficoltà che ne derivano di ordine economico, produttivo, politico-sociale e di rapporti tra le diverse aree geopolitiche fanno da sfondo a quello che qualcuno ha chiamato “la<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jchc5">Performance and Personhood in Caribbean Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: The task of this book is to think through how Caribbean textual representations of performance broaden understandings of personhood. To explore how the genre of performance specifically can intercede in definitions of personhood, this chapter offers a performance analysis of Marissa Chibas’s 2007 one-woman play
                  Daughter of a Cuban Revolutionary. Throughout the play, Chibas performs much of the “backstage” work—such as establishing the scene’s time and place, or getting in and out of character—and exposes otherwise unseen labor. In so doing,Daughterdemonstrates how the means of creating theater give us a point of entry into redefining personhood.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt19jcj20">Rethinking the "Romance of the Rose"</a><br>
  Author(s) Nichols Stephen G.<br>
  Abstract: Ekphrasis no longer enjoys the name recognition it once did. In the terminology of classical rhetoric, ekphrasis “was the elaborate ‘delineation’ (έκΦρασις,
                  descriptio, description), of people, places, buildings, works of art. Late antique and medieval poetry used it lavishly” (Curtis, 69). But, along with figurative language generally, it fell victim to the hostility toward classical rhetoric manifested by literary movements from romanticism to modernism. Indeed, one history of rhetoric still in use claims authoritatively: “ekphrasis . . . perverts descriptions because it frustrates narrative movement; [and] . . . confirms a decadent habit of literature” (Baldwin, 19).

  Author(s) RASTEGAR KAMRAN<br>
  Abstract: Questions of ideological dedication are perhaps most fraught within the context of war. Memory discourse, in particular on the memory of war and its traumas, is often a legitimating instrument in the contest to elaborate who serves as hero and who as traitor during the war and afterward. In post-revolutionary Iran, the onset of the Iran-Iraq War allowed for the articulation of new if shifting parameters for ideological commitment and heroism, as well as treachery or cowardice. The evolution of the “sacred defense” concept allowed for the most articulate elaboration of these binaries, and wartime and postwar cultural producers, bureaucrats,<br>

  Abstract: Fidelity certainly does not rank among the central themes of Walter Benjamin’s work.¹ Likewise, it has garnered little attention in critical reception of his work so far—one will mostly look in vain for the term in the indexes of scholarly works on Benjamin.² The word nevertheless occupies a crucial position in Benjamin’s conception of life. It appears to have played an indispensable role in the elaboration of a fundamental facet of Benjamin’s thought: the double determination of human life as both creaturely (or natural) and supernatural, and thus of a concept of life derived from its relationship to these<br>

Anthropologists and historians have come together here in order to recapture, elaborate, and criticize pre-Cultural Turn and non-Cultural Turn modes of analysing structures of experience, feeling, subjectivity and action in human societies and to highlight the still unexploited possibilities developed among others in the work of scholars such as Norbert Elias, Max Gluckman, Eric Wolf, E.P.

  Book Title: Recollections of France-Memories, Identities and Heritage in Contemporary France<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Picard Jeanine<br>
  Abstract: Since the 1980s, France has experienced a vigorous revival of interest in its past and cultural heritage. This has been expressed as part of a movement of remembering through museums and festivals as well as via elaborate commemorations, most notably those held to celebrate the bi-centenary of the Revolution in 1989 and can be interpreted as part of a re-examinaton of what it means to be French in the context of ongoing Europeanization. This study brings together scholars from multidisciplinary backgrounds and engages them in debate with professionals from France, who are working in the fields of museology, heritage and cultural production. Addressing subjects such as war and memory, gastronomy and regional identity, maritime culture and urban societies, they throw fresh light on the process by which France has been conceptualized and packaged as a cultural object.<br>

  Abstract: The long and complicated process of social, economic, and political transformation of central and eastern Europe, which began in 1989, is still far from complete and needs much more research to be fully understood in its many aspects. The decomposition, construction, and reconstruction of collective identities constitute one of the dimensions of this transformation that has been widely debated, but which still causes controversy and must be better understood. Contemporary central and eastern Europe is thus a very productive place to study – a social laboratory ideal for researchers interested in social change.<br>

The GI benefits ultimately extended to sixteen million GIs (veterans of the Korean War as well) included priority in jobs—that is, preferential hiring, but no one objected to it then—financial support during the job search; small loans for starting up businesses; and, most important, low-interest home loans and educational<br>

Two other inter-connected political phenomena emanate from the widely shared belief that whites are superior to blacks. First, whites of widely varying socio-economic status employ white supremacy as a catalyst to negotiate policy differences, often through compromises that sacrifice the rights of blacks. Second, even those whites who lack wealth and power are sustained in their sense of racial superiority and more<br>

  Book Title: Writings on Medicine-  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Meyers Todd<br>
  Abstract: At the time of his death in 1995, Georges Canguilhem was a highly respected historian of science and medicine, whose engagement with questions of normality, the ideologization of scientific thought, and the conceptual history of biology had marked the thought of philosophers such as Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Pierre Bourdieu, and Gilles Deleuze. This collection of short, incisive, and highly accessible essays on the major concepts of modern medicine shows Canguilhem at the peak of his use of historical practice for philosophical engagement. In order to elaborate a philosophy of medicine, Canguilhem examines paramount problems such as the definition and uses of health, the decline of the Hippocratic understanding of nature, the experience of disease, the limits of psychology in medicine, myths and realities of therapeutic practices, the difference between cure and healing, the organism's self-regulation, and medical metaphors linking the organism to society. Writings on Medicine is at once an excellent introduction to Canguilhem's work and a forceful, insightful, and accessible engagement with elemental concepts in medicine. The book is certain to leave its imprint on anthropology, history, philosophy, bioethics, and the social studies of medicine.<br>

  Abstract: “In the past half-century, two works have marked what can be called conceptual breakthroughs in our apprehension of the Holocaust,” writes Shoshana Felman in her 2002 book
                  The Juridical Unconscious.¹ “The first was Hannah Arendt’sEichmann in Jerusalem, which appeared in the United States in 1963 as a report on the Eichmann trial held in Israel in 1961. The second was the filmShoahby Claude Lanzmann, which first appeared in France in 1985.” These two works, Felman elaborates, changed “the vocabulary of collective memory”—they added a “new idiomto the discourse on the Holocaust.” A new idiom, Felman<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1c999bq">Memory</a><br>
  Author(s) Hage Ghassan<br>
  Abstract: The relation between home and food is an essential one. Its ideological power is constantly exhibited in various items of everyday life such as the status of the “homemade” on the food market. That a quiche, for example, is labeled “homemade” at one’s local delicatessen distinguishes it from the mass-produced. It makes it ooze that specifically homely goodness: intimations of sound nutrition, careful choice of ingredients, and careful labor (of love). That is, it becomes a bit of “mother’s cooking”—which, at an important level, is, of course, a continuation of breast-feeding, the most homely of the homely yearnings and<br>

  Author(s) MacCannell Juliet Flower<br>
  Abstract: For me, the most valuable aspect of J. Hillis Miller’s work is his persistent questioning of literary language in the context of a widely ranging philosophical inquiry into the human (and lately the inhuman) conditions in which literature emerges. From his first to his most recent books, we find Miller courageously confronting whatever the mind has thought unfathomable. Indeed, Hillis Miller is one of the few great critics of our time to underscore precisely the

  Abstract: In the following collection of readings largely inspired by the work of Wallace Stevens, I endeavour to situate his poetry, sometimes directly and in other cases quite speculatively, among contexts not often associated with its extraordinary achievement in the annals of modern American culture: the gay alongside the straight fictional narrative (as in chapters 2 and 3), the classic American film (chapter 4), the postwar poetic “school” (chapter 5), and even contemporary architecture (chapter 6). Among these “other” contexts thanks to Stevens, I continue further to advance the claim elaborated previously (in

  Abstract: Several long-standing shifts in biblical studies suggest that biblical interpretation is done best in a collaborative way. Fernando Segovia, in

  Abstract: Since the importance of reading Wesley’s poetry in the context of the time in which he lived has been emphasized, it is essential to set the Wesleyan poetical sources from which the poetical selections for this volume have been drawn in their own context.

In some instances this will be more obvious than others. It is hoped that these contextual elaborations will assist the reader in the understanding<br>

  Author(s) Pabst Adrian<br>
  Abstract: In a sense, the global recession of 2007–2010 is just another reminder that capitalist economies suffer periodic crises but that capitalism does not collapse under the weight of its own inner contradictions. Instead, it always reverts to the “normal” cycle of expansion, contraction, and recovery. This reversion is linked to over-accumulation and falling profit rates that prompt capital owners to cut the real wages of laborers in order to generate new surplus value, as both Adam Smith and Karl Marx recognized.¹ But whereas Smith evaded the issue of “primitive accumulation,” Marx followed Sir James Steuart in arguing that this<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgf6b4">Spiritual Complaint</a><br>
  Author(s) Bulkeley Tim<br>
  Abstract: The claim by Shakespeare's Juliette “What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet” is often quoted to claim that naming is arbitrary. Yet what we call things matters. For our classifying, and hence our naming, in part defines what we can and will perceive. This chapter investigates three approaches to naming the genre present in the speeches commonly known as “the confessions of Jeremiah” in order to uncover three responses to the dark times. While these are different they also often coincide and collaborate as our spirits respond to disaster<br>

  Author(s) Mackenzie Alistair<br>
  Abstract: The grief that accompanies loss is a universal experience. Most cultures have developed mourning rituals to express this grief. Among these rituals are laments. Laments are common and take a variety of forms. Laments may be elaborate poems, or sung chants, or “tuneful weeping.”² They usually involve mourning, but not just for the dead. There are laments about the fall of great cities, about emigration from the points of view of both those who leave and those who are left behind, and laments related to marriage rituals as a bride leaves to join her husband’s household.<br>

  Abstract: On first read, Vanhoozer and de Lubac would seem a most unfit choice of dialogue partners of the topic of God’s use of Scripture. Vanhoozer insists on the sufficiency of the literal sense, while de Lubac insists on the indispensability of the spiritual sense. Vanhoozer develops an elaborate proposal for God’s authorship based on speech-act theory, while de Lubac largely ignores divine authorship and instead focuses attention on God’s sacramental presence in Scripture. Vanhoozer focuses on Scripture’s determinate meaning, while de Lubac focuses on Scripture’s infinite meaning. Yet what the two have in common is their persistent emphasis on God’s<br>

  Book Title: God's Wounds-Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Volume 1. Divine Vulnerability and Creation<br>
  Publisher: James Clarke & Co<br>
  Author(s): Pool Jeff B.<br>
  Abstract: This book constitutes the first volume of a three-volume study of Christian testimonies to divine suffering: God's Wounds: Hermeneutic of the Christian Symbol of Divine Suffering, Divine Vulnerability and Creation. This study first develops an approach to interpreting the contested claims about the suffering of God. Thus, the larger study focuses its inquiry into the testimonies to divine suffering themselves, seeking to allow the voices that attest to divine suffering to speak freely, to discover and elucidate the internal logic or rationality of this family of testimonies, rather than defending these attestations against the dominant claims of classical Christian theism that have historically sought to eliminate such language altogether from Christian discourse about the nature and life of God. Through this approach, this volume of studies into the Christian symbol of divine suffering then investigates the two major presuppositions that the larger family of testimonies to divine suffering normally hold: an understanding of God through the primary metaphor of love (God is love); and an understanding of the human as created in the image of God, with a life (though finite) analogous to the divine life - the imago Dei as love. When fully elaborated, these presuppositions reveal the conditions of possibility for divine suffering and divine vulnerability with respect to creation.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1cgfbzc">Church and Ethical Responsibility in the Midst of World Economy</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter is a study of the limitations and contributions of Karl Marx in the economic field. I shall deal with basic elements in Marx’s political economy and his method of historical materialism in reference to Hegel, because Marx’s thought cannot be properly understood without Hegel’s concept of labor and alienation in civil society. Marx’s critique of religion implies his negative evaluation of the role of church mission in the domestic-economic context, as well as in the colonial context. As we have previously seen, Marx’s critique of mission and colonialism and his analysis of the Christian character of capital accumulation<br>

  Abstract: Since the days of Marx, the shift to monopoly capitalism in the phase of imperialism has made Marx’s theory questionable and even obsolete. The unemployed army as capitalism’s gravediggers turned into labor aristocrats. Not competition in industrial capitalism, but monopoly played a decisive role in changed economic life. Bank capital has merged with industrial capital and this merger created finance capital. The export of capital became greatly important. Through international monopoly the territorial division of unoccupied parts of the world was established among the major capitalist powers and their satellites.¹<br>

As for the change in ecumenical landscape, Vatican II led Anglicans and Roman Catholics in Canada to cordial and close relationships with surprising speed. Within ten years of the opening session of Vatican II, the Canadian arms of the two communions were co-operating in such ventures as dialogue groups, local collaborations of various kinds, the Toronto School of Theology, and inter-church coalitions for social justice.

Prepared in manuscript form as early as 1914, but not published until 1927,Cogeweais a fascinating read that blends tropes from romance, Western, autoethnography, captivity narrative, and realism. In its confusions, earnestness, and collaborative minglings, Mourning Dove’s novel is uniquely North American; it could not have been written by anyone but a North American. The excitement and tension of its contents, its multi-voicings, and the necessary frustrations of its narrative sutures comprise a consummate artistic<br>

  Publisher: Les Presses de l'Université d'Ottawa<br>
  Author(s): KÉRISIT MICHÈLE<br>
  Abstract: Peint et chanté, voilé ou dévoilé, usé et abusé, le corps féminin est depuis toujours au centre de la création artistique occidentale. Qu'en est-il, cependant, de sa place dans les sciences sociales ? Comment le corps des femmes a-t-il été pensé et représenté en sociologie, en criminologie, en travail social ou en gérontologie, par exemple ? Cet ouvrage collectif a pour premier objectif d'amorcer ce travail critique en débusquant les logiques patriarcales qui dominent les discours savants développés dans les différentes disciplines des sciences sociales et mettant en scène le corps des femmes. Ce faisant, il montre également comment se sont historiquement construites, et se construisent encore, des représentations de corps de femmes illégitimes ou transgresseurs ou dangereux. Le second objectif de cet ouvrage est de repenser cette image en mettant en lumière les multiples façons que les femmes peuvent utiliser pour subvertir ces représentations dominantes et pour se poser comme sujets tant dans l'élaboration des savoirs que dans la sphère du politique.<br>

Ensuite, l’ensemble des textes, en criminologie comme ailleurs, n’ont généralement pas comme préoccupation centrale « le corps dans sa réalité sociale globale » (Berthelot, 1983 :124-125), ce qui pose le défi d'élaborer une approche qui permette de respecter la pluralité de dimensions et de sens que peut revêtir le corps social.

That is, those who do not consider metaphysics to be a naturally knowable discipline with conclusions regarding God and the soul subject to demonstrative reason as such, apart from advertence to any revealed premise, will find it impossible to credit Aristotle as having so much as adverted to God rather than<br>

Her observation that vampires are an ever-changing archetype reflecting societal concerns and anxieties of the particular generation that it derives from is well substantiated. However, the vampire’s broad appeal, for the most part, lies with European American writers and audiences, particularly as depicted in literature, film, and television.¹ One might ask why vampires are not represented to a greater degree in African American culture, especially literature—after all, vampires seem an ideal metaphor to describe North American slavery.

Aunque inicialmente prevista de un año de duración, según Leopoldo Gutiérrez de Zubiaurre la situación prebélica que vivía Europa había hecho sospechar a su padre que la estancia de la familia en el extranjero podría ser bastante más larga. Encina había contado con algunos meses para preparar su salida de España, que había tenido lugar a comienzos de septiembre de 1938<br>

  Abstract: This theoretical inquiry into the concept of the
                  eventstarts with Heidegger’s thinking aboutdas Ereignis, usually translated as “event of appropriation,” by means of which he elaborates a philosophy of Being as event.¹ Indeed, Heidegger offers an important source in the study of the event insofar as it is considered not as a simple happening in the world but rather as that which makes any happening possible. The priority Heidegger assigns this term casts a new light on some acute traditional problems concerning the conception of time and presence, the identity of things, human being, and the essence of<br>

  Abstract: Claude Lévi-Strauss is often accused of paying too little regard for history and human agency.

  Author(s) Swann Brian<br>
  Abstract: Translating Native American languages is a very different process from translating European languages. For one thing, the translation of European languages does not usually present real physical and spiritual dangers.¹ For another, there are the complexities of collaboration between non-Native academics and Native American culture-bearers, formerly “informants.” Moreover, translators have to decide how to transform oral expression into a written form, and in addition they may have to produce their own grammars and dictionaries, as part of what Julie Brittain and Marguerite MacKenzie in this volume term “a unique constellation of factors.” This constellation can also include “the interaction of<br>

  Abstract: In this chapter we discuss a number of issues pertinent to the translation of Canadian Aboriginal oral literature, specifically that of the Algonquian peoples of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula (eastern Canada). Our discussion focuses on a collection of “oral texts” (the Innu-Naskapi collection) with which we have been involved as translators since 1985 (MacKenzie) and 1996 (Brittain).¹ Working collaboratively with native speakers of the Aboriginal language, we have now published English translations of several stories from this collection (e.g., MacKenzie 2004; Brittain and Mac-Kenzie et al. 2004, 2005). The Innu-Naskapi collection was recorded on cassette tape in 1967 and 1968. It<br>

  Abstract: A memorable image from one of America’s most frequently rendered patriotic songs, “amber waves of grain” holds a special place in the nation’s understanding of itself. The planting of the prairies after 1850, the story goes, benefited American citizens as well as the people of the world, ushering in modernity and providing a livelihood for countless impoverished European immigrants.

  Author(s) MAJEWSKI JOHN<br>
  Abstract: The recent literature on slavery has unexpectedly brought to light a new historical problem: why did the Republican Party oppose the expansion of slavery? Historians have commonly understood that most mainstream Republicans, whatever their moral objections to slavery, opposed the institution’s expansion because of economic reasons. Slavery, in the minds of many Republicans, was incompatible with a flourishing free-labor economy. As the historian John Ashworth has put it, “It is no exaggeration to say that Republicans fought the Civil War primarily because they deplored the economic effects of slavery.”¹ If slavery were allowed to expand, Republicans believed, lazy and indolent<br>

  Abstract: As we have seen, Grecanici governance is based on elaborate contexts of relatedness, a collapsing spatiotemporal arena encompassing the living and the dead, affective items such as religious relics and icons, divine entities, and associationism. This matrix may also be captured in the persona of ’Ndrangheta. The profile of ’Ndrangheta as oscillating between earthly joys and heavenly possessions allows for a theorization of power as continually reestablished and circulated between humans and nonhumans.<br>

  Abstract: Though lying is not the same as storytelling, the two are not entirely unrelated. Both involve the construction and communication of counterfactual propositions and narratives. The difference between the two is in both the intent of the speaker and the understanding of the audience. Liars know the truth and attempt to conceal it, usually to advantage themselves at the expense of their auditors. On the other hand, both storytellers and story hearers (or story readers) usually understand that a fictional story is something other than literal truth—rather than working against each other, they collaborate in a mutually beneficial form<br>

He writes: “On the one hand, our traditional categories of conceptualization and representation may well be insufficient, our language itself problematic. On the other hand, in the face of these events we feel the need of some stable narration; a boundless field of possible discourse raises the issue of limits with particular stringency.”¹ These concerns about processes, rhetoric, and memory have an impact<br>

  Abstract: The international socialist and labor movement of Europe was the largest global social movement in the pre–World War I era. Uniting diverse socialist and labor parties under a loosely knit organization known as the Second International (1889–1914), it stood as the model for political mobilization and social change. At its height the Second International encompassed labor and socialist organizations in more than twenty countries across Europe and even had links with organizations in North America, South America, Africa, and Asia.

  Abstract: As a break from their ordained labors, what might the Muses today do on their lunch hour? This collection of witty, shrewd, and imaginative essays addresses interdisciplinary topics that range widely from Shakespeare, to psychoanalysis, to the practice of higher education today. With the ease born of deep knowledge, Marjorie Garber moves from comical journalistic quirks (GÇ£Fig LeavesGÇ¥) to the curious return of myth and ritual in the theories of evolutionary psychologists (GÇ£Ovid, Now and ThenGÇ¥)._x000D_ Two themes emerge consistently in GarberGÇÖs latest exploration of symptoms of culture. The first is that to predict the GÇ£next big thingGÇ¥ in literary studies we should look back at ideas and practices set aside by a previous generation of critics. In the past several decades we have seen the reemergence ofGÇöfor exampleGÇötextual editing, biography, character criticism, aesthetics, and philology as GÇ£hotGÇ¥ new areas for critical intervention. The second theme expands on this observation, making the case for GÇ£cultural forgettingGÇ¥ as the way the arts and humanities renew themselves, both within fields and across them. Although she is never represented in traditional paintings or poetry, a missing MuseGÇöwe can call her AmnesiaGÇöturns out to be a key figure for the creation of theory and criticism in the arts.<br>

  Author(s) Nash Kate<br>
  Abstract: As a sociologist working in the emerging area of the sociology of human rights, I find the approach that Luc Boltanski and his various collaborators take to cultural, moral, and political questions inspiring. There is an urgent need to develop theoretical concepts and methodologies to study human rights, which have been growing in importance as a result of the activities of transnational advocacy networks, digital communication, and the codification and enactment of international law since the end of the Cold War (see Nash, 2012). What resources do human rights offer for the critique of injustices? Are human rights contributing to<br>

  Book Title: Perspectives critiques en communication-Contextes, théories et recherches empiriques<br>
  Publisher: Presses de l'Université du Québec<br>
  Author(s): Rueff Julien<br>
  Abstract: Cette introduction aux perspectives critiques présente un large éventail d’approches théoriques élaborées en sciences sociales ou en philosophie, allant du XVIIIe siècle, avec la philosophie critique de Kant, jusqu’aux développements les plus contemporains en économie critique de la communication, en études de genre ou encore en philosophie sociale, en passant par Marx, Engels, Foucault, Habermas, Bourdieu et Honneth pour ne nommer que ces derniers. Ces approches accordent toutes une place centrale à l’analyse des pathologies sociales, que ce soit les inégalités économiques, les phénomènes de domination coloniale ou postcoloniale, la privation des droits politiques, le mépris à l’endroit des minorités culturelles, les maux du travail, les rapports de pouvoir de genre ou la surveillance de masse. Elles sont abordées ici par une quinzaine d’auteurs comme autant de ressources conceptuelles pour appréhender des objets de recherche communicationnels comme le journalisme, la propagande politique, la publicité politique, les médias sociaux, les industries culturelles ou les relations publiques. De quoi parle le théoricien critique ? Quelles sont les finalités des perspectives critiques ? Quels phénomènes sociaux, culturels, politiques ou économiques retiennent l’attention des chercheurs critiques ? Quelles sont les limites de ces approches ? Quelles formes prennent-elles ? Résolument pédagogique, cet ouvrage se donne pour triple objectif de contextualiser des constructions conceptuelles a priori peu accessibles, de les exposer clairement afin d’en faciliter l’appropriation, mais aussi de démontrer leur pertinence pour la réalisation de recherches empiriques dans le domaine de la communication.<br>

  Author(s) Anderson Daniel Gustav<br>
  Abstract: For those of us who wish to carry on living—as bodies and as “us,” a totality of lived relations—ENERGY is needed. How do we get enough calories to get up and do it again or to create something? Collaboration is necessary, but on what terms? For now, the terms by which people must engage with one another to meet their needs for energy are capitalist ones. “The capitalist production process,” our best theorist on the matter explains, is “a process of accumulation” (K. Marx 1991, 324). Accumulation of what, by whom, and with what consequences? These questions of<br>

  Abstract: Every day we dress in oil. At each stage in the process of making, purchasing, and discarding clothing and other textiles, oil is present as a secret companion. Petrochemicals douse the cotton fields; oil powers the complex farm machinery that has replaced hand labor in the fields; it powers the vast looms that weave cotton into fabric. Oil polymers subtend the many synthetic and natural-synthetic hybrid fabrics that make possible a waterproof, stainresistant, hard-wearing, easily replaced material existence. Underlying the vast transport systems that carry textiles and apparel across the globe is oil. At the end of their lives, as<br>

  Abstract: “There’s wood enough within”: projected from offstage, this response to Prospero’s summoning in
                  The Tempestlaunches Caliban into literary history (Shakespeare 1999, 1.2.315). Its emphasis on adequacy indicates that the slave has completed his work. Stemming from this sense of closure, its disgruntled tone suggests an insubordination later elaborated in Caliban’s plan to murder Prospero and burn his books. Such acts of defiance have made Caliban, as Jonathan Goldberg says, “a byword for anticolonial riposte” (2004, ix). But what of the wood? This question may seem slight when weighed against empire and resistance to it, but Caliban uncovers the indispensability<br>

  Abstract: Labor is the greatest reality of human life in this world, it is a primary reality.… In labor there is both a truth of redemption (“in the sweat of your face shall you gain your bread”) and a truth of the creative and constructive power of men. Both elements are present in labor. Human labor humanizes nature; it bears witness to the great mission of man in nature. But sin and evil have perverted the mission of labor.

Destaca el ejercicio paralelo entre la experiencia investigada y la de investigar. Reflexionando desde conceptos clave como experiencia, red de significados y performance, se tocan temas como la observación participante y sus consecuencias; la manera en la que una entrevista afecta los resultados de una investigación, y la transformación de la conciencia histórica a partir de la experiencia y la expectativa. Desentrañar la relación entre hechos de trascendencia social y su elaboración narrativa es la aportación de este trabajo.<br>

  Abstract: In 1850, Waterhouse & Co., Jewelers of Dame Street, Dublin, acquired a fabulous golden brooch that had recently washed up on a Drogheda beach, like a message in a bottle from the ancient Irish past (Whitfield 1976, 106). Made of gilt silver, the brooch’s surfaces were decorated with gold granulation, filigree interlace designs, champlevé enamel bosses, and imported gemstones. Only 8.7 centimeters in diameter, its fine decoration was suited to the contemporary taste for elaborate pattern.

  Author(s): Zubía Teresa Oñate y<br>
  Abstract: La madre Tierra está preñada: algo está sucediendo. Se alumbran nuevos caminos, senderos más justos. A pesar de la crisis mundial y local podemos anunciar con optimismo que se observan señales. Rastreemos esos retazos, futuros ya presentes, posibles diversos, a pie de calle que apuntan hacia una democracia mucho más plural y participativa, más bella, donde nadie quede fuera del precioso (no contaminado) cielo estrellado. Los perdedores de la globalización, señores, están gritando con voz plural y unísona: ¡conectémonos! El Papa Francisco, Vattimo, Oñate, el Concilio Vaticano II o las Teologías de la liberación, las nuevas plataformas sociales… Hay señales: ¡investiguémoslas! Unamos todos estos horizontes: los bíblicos, los teológicos y los políticos que asisten nuestro mundo actual y postmoderno. Si logramos acompañarnos, conseguiremos interpretar, «dejar hablar lo no dicho del pasado, el bien que no está dado, el que tiene que poder venir si encuentra algún lugar adecuado donde poder acontecer». Si es así, podremos disfrutar, aún con límites, de un genial tapiz. Todas las piezas del puzle están sobre el terreno. La tierra prometida es esta…aquí y ahora, y es una tierra solidaria con entrañas de misericordia. La política, la religión y la razón siguen vivas, pero tienen un límite… ¡Sólo el amor podrá salvarnos! Jesús Lozano Pino es malagueño, Doctor en Filosofía y Magíster Universitario en Filosofía teórica y práctica por la UNED (especialidad en Historia de la fi losofía y pensamiento contemporáneo). Su investigación gira en torno a las líneas fronterizas entre fi losofía y teología, y cuya tesis titulada Más allá del infi nito, el límite: el amor. El oxímoron de lo divino (Refl ejos bíblicos, teológicos y políticos del debolismo kenótico-caritativo de Gianni Vattimo en la postmodernidad) pone en conexión al nuevo Papa Francisco y a la teología de la liberación con el pensamiento Oñate-Vattimo.

  Abstract: La dificultad de dar un concepto de Derecho viene dada, entre otras razones, por el componente subjetivista de su autor y las circunstancias que puedan influirle en un momento determinado, apartándole de la objetividad que debe de ofrecer cualquier definición. Un concepto de Derecho, y menos de Derecho penal, no puede ser inmutable en el espacio ni en el tiempo.

  Book Title: Teoría contemporánea de los derechos humanos. Elementos para una reconstrucción sistémica-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): García José Antonio López<br>
  Abstract: El respaldo a la teoría de los derechos humanos, así como a las declaraciones y tratados internacionales, es un hecho geo-político de la mayor relevancia, al cual se han sumado por razones de convicción o conveniencia la mayoría de los países delo que llamamos “el mundo civilizado". Tales instrumentos se han convertido entonces en un punto de referencia obligado para cualquier estudio y discusión de carácter moral, jurídico y político, y en un paradigma para los valores humanos y criterios de legitimidad del ejercicio del poder público. La ciencia jurídica actual ha considerado que la dignidad humana es cualidad principalísima de todo ser humano, que debe ser respetada bajo cualquier circunstancia y bajo ese sustrato que fundamenta la convivencia social, la tendencia real es lograr su adecuada protección, encontrarla idea de que todos estamos involucrados en una tarea común; la tarea de conocer cuál es el vínculo que nos une en cuanto seres humanos o humanidad para llegar al cumplimiento de una responsabilidad de todas y todos; la preservación de la dignidad humana como núcleo esencial de los derechos humanos. El propósito de este libro es presentar, con una virtud de orientación teórica y sistémica, la más amplia información sobre las propuestas que los grandes tratadistas en la materia han formulado en los últimos años, haciendo énfasis en las expresiones que delimitan su concepción; tales como derechos naturales, derechos fundamentales, derechos subjetivos o derechos morales. Se resaltan también los aciertos y debilidades de sus distintas definiciones y de todo el elenco de categorías jurídicas relacionadas, para intentar ofrecernos un extenso panorama de lo que son o se consideran los derechos humanos y la forma en que su estudio se ha desarrollado desde el análisis de gabinete hasta la práctica. Para todo lo anterior, se abordan, entre otras, las teorías de los iusfilósofos recientes más reconocidos como Gregorio Peces-Barba, Luigi Ferrajoli, Angelo Papacchini, Robert Alexy, Ronald Dworkin, John Rawls, Francisco Laporta, Antonio E. Pérez Luño, LiborioHierro, y Elías Díaz; con lo que esta obra pretende convertirse en referencia ineludible para todos aquellos que se dediquen al estudio, investigación y aplicación de los temas que aborda, lo mismo que para quienes sólo deseen introducirse con bases firmes a la teoría contemporánea de los derechos humanos.

  Book Title: Acción, deber, donación. Dos dimensiones éticas inseparables de la acción-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): Seifert Josef<br>
  Abstract: Tomando por guía la acción, el presente libro analiza en sus dos primeras partes las vertientes fenomenológico- eidética, hermenéutica y ética de la acción en diálogo con los autores clásicos y contemporáneos que más representativamente las han abordado (Tomás de Aquino, Ricoeur, Polo, Scheler, Wojtyla..). El autor muestra que no son estadios superpuestos, sino que se puede transitar del análisis eidético al hermenéutico a través del agente motivado en sus actos voluntarios y de las mediaciones cultural e histórica de su actuación y se desemboca al fi n en el nivel ético cuando se repara en la exigencia de universalización que reivindica la acción en tanto que humana. La tercera parte aborda las dos fuentes éticas de la donación y la obligación, resaltando la convergencia de ambas desde el primado de la donación. Para ello Urbano Ferrer cuenta con los relevantes estudios sobre el don procedentes del área francesa (Mauss, Marion, Derrida, Bruaire..) y termina enmarcándolo constitutivamente en la persona. No pretende una síntesis de diferentes planteamientos, sino dejarse llevar por las cosas mismas en sus conexiones de esencia y traer a colación a propósito de ellas las averiguaciones de los autores aludidos, ejerciendo la crítica desde el contraste con las evidencias de esencia. Urbano FERRER SANTOS es Catedrático de Filosofía Moral de la Universidad de Murcia y Profesor Visitante de las Universidades de Dresde y Lublin. Su producción filosófica se centra en la fenomenología (con especial atención a Husserl, Scheler, Edith Stein, von Hildebrand, Reinach..), en Teoría de la Acción y en distintos estudios sobre la persona.

  Book Title: Diversidad de género, minorías sexuales y teorías feministas. Superposiciones entre las teorías de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transexuales y el feminismo en la reformulación de conceptos y estrategias político-jurídicas-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): ATIENZA CRISTINA MONEREO<br>
  Abstract: De manera bastante reciente los textos político-jurídicos sobre orientación sexual e identidad de género han empezado a proliferar significativamente. Las reivindicaciones del colectivo de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales y transexuales (a partir de ahora LGBT) se atendieron de forma más o menos anecdótica en sus inicios, pero actualmente este grupo se está considerando con más atención. Además, el oportuno interés por la igualdad y los derechos del colectivo de LGBT ha trasladado a la esfera de la Política y el Derecho un intenso debate filosófico sobre la condición individual y social de las personas integrantes de este grupo, que a su vez ha retomado conceptos complejos también analizados y discutidos en otros colectivos como el feminista. Como sucede en el caso del feminismo, la tarea de delimitar las nociones implicadas es espinosa por la heterogeneidad existente entre sus miembros y por la propia organización social del sistema social. Sin embargo, es una labor primordial para entender y atender a sus proposiciones. Esta investigación va dirigida a aclarar este mapa conceptual complejo con el fin de promover la igualdad real y la eficacia de los derechos, no tan nuevos ni emergentes, del colectivo de LGBT.<br>

El arte de la memoria, como se ha visto, ofrecía una técnica para visualizar de manera humanística lo no visualizable, a fin de elaborar y dis-poner el conocimiento para su empleo en situaciones futuras, y así orientarse en un tiempo propio erigido sobre las distinciones entre recuerdo, deseo y esperanza.

  CHAPTER 1  ON THE ESSENTIAL IN MYTH: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3225s">Mythical Intentions in Modern Literature</a><br>
  Abstract: The archetypalist position is a very familiar one in literary studies, where it has sanctioned a long history of interpretation as the art of translating symbols into universal archetypes. From this we learn, according to Jung, that the creative process “consists in the unconscious activation of an archetypal image, and in elaborating and shaping this image into the finished work. By giving it shape, the artist translates it into the language of the present, and so makes it possible for us to find our way back to the deepest springs of life.”³ Jung is clearly the most influential figure in<br>

  TWO  Imagery and the Landscape of Desire from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1m3nxp7">Language and Desire in Seneca's "Phaedra"</a><br>
  Abstract: In all of Seneca’s plays the psychological atmosphere depends heavily on imagery. In the Phaedra images of fire, enclosure, and heaviness and the contrasting imagery of interior and exterior space depict the stifling emotional world in which the characters seem entrapped. Against this mood of constriction, however, Seneca sets elaborate rhetorical descriptions of sky, forest, or sea. The concentrated energy of such descriptions sets into sharp relief the protagonists’ ineffectiveness or helplessness in the face of the emotional violence within and around them.<br>

  Abstract: As the secondary elaboration of a celebrated classic, Seneca’s

Seneca has his own message to convey; but, because that message is inextricable from his implicit commentary on the Euripidean play, his work calls attention to its textuality, that is, to its status as a workwrittenin response to a pre-existent text that the author knows, presumably, through reading. It thus stands in a context of verbal artifice and artificiality; and its very existence implies and demands<br>

Penso che anche una ricerca, come un racconto, può avere la capacità di superare il suo stesso finale per rimodellarsi criticamente attraverso la lettura.

  Book Title: Sodomscapes-Hospitality in the Flesh<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gallagher Lowell<br>
  Abstract: Sodomscapes presents a fresh approach to the story of Lot’s wife, as it’s been read across cultures and generations. In the process, it reinterprets foundational concepts of ethics, representation, and the body. While the sudden mutation of Lot’s wife in the flight from Sodom is often read to confirm our antiscopic bias, a rival tradition emphasizes the counterintuitive optics required to nurture sustainable habitations for life in view of its unforeseeable contingency. Whether in medieval exegesis, Russian avant-garde art, Renaissance painting, or today’s Dead Sea health care tourism industry, the repeated desire to reclaim Lot’s wife turns the cautionary emblem of the mutating woman into a figural laboratory for testing the ethical bounds of hospitality. Sodomscape—the book’s name for this gesture—revisits touchstone moments in the history of figural thinking and places them in conversation with key thinkers of hospitality. The book’s cumulative perspective identifies Lot’s wife as the resilient figure of vigilant dwelling, whose in-betweenness discloses counterintuitive ways of understanding what counts as a life amid divergent claims of being-with and being-for.<br>

  Abstract: ‘A period of experimentation of all types’ – with these terms the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur once described the interwar years through which he had lived as a young man.¹ Tomás Masaryk, just installed as first president of the new Czechoslovak state, thought post-1918 Europe a ‘laboratory built over the great graveyard of the World War’.² Europeans were partly forced to experiment because both tradition and dynastic legitimacy had ceased to provide principles for public order, but new ones had hardly become entrenched.

In the jungle of nerve cells (the neurons) and their interconnections at synapses, of which it is composed, we must try to identify pertinent features of its organization and function, Ariadne’s thread to the center of the labyrinth.

  Abstract: Before science developed, humans elaborated mythical reflections to give some meaning to events and experiences they encountered and to establish classifications that were “superior to chaos,” as Claude Lévi-Strauss said. Theories included creation by gods and spontaneous generation. Common concepts included great floods to punish sins and re-create the world, and creation of life in a primeval ocean by successive steps. In the West the myth of dualism of body and soul emerged. The dualist, creationist view was opposed from ancient Greece onward by more materialist concepts, some of which emphasized that diverse elements could be combined randomly to form<br>

  Book Title: Edmund Husserl and Eugen Fink-Beginnings and Ends in Phenomenology, 1928–1938<br>

  Author(s): BRUZINA RONALD<br>
  Abstract: Eugen Fink was Edmund Husserl's research assistant during the last decade of the renowned phenomenologist's life, a period in which Husserl's philosophical ideas were radically recast. In this landmark book, Ronald Bruzina shows that Fink was actually a collaborator with Husserl, contributing indispensable elements to their common enterprise.Drawing on hundreds of hitherto unknown notes and drafts by Fink, Bruzina highlights the scope and depth of his theories and critiques. He places these philosophical formulations in their historical setting, organizes them around such key themes as the world, time, life, and the concept and methodological place of the "meontic," and demonstrates that they were a pivotal impetus for the renewing of "regress to the origins" in transcendental-constitutive phenomenology.<br>

By ‘medium’ here I am not referring to television as a business that churns out countless stories.

Finalmente, se agregan dos estudios de la creatividad verbal en los juegos de palabras, que plantean serias interrogantes a los lexicógrafos acerca de la manera de tratarlos en un diccionario.<br>

  Abstract: Uno de los problemas que se presentan obligatoriamente al lexicógrafo que elabora un diccionario es el orden de las acepciones que componen el artículo lexicográfico¹. La linealidad de la escritura, que fuerza la aparición de un antes y un después, origina el orden del artículo, pero es ante todo un reflejo de la temporalidad del habla y, por lo tanto, parte de la naturaleza de las lenguas, por lo que el orden de acepciones es, en primera instancia, una condición impuesta a la lexicografía por la propia naturaleza de las lenguas.<br>

  Abstract: Over the last decade, contemporary art in Hong Kong, informed by travel(ing) theory, the special administrative region’s ambiguous (post) colonial-national-global connections and its inimitable set of historical and cultural situations, has been preoccupied with the themes of mobility, transition, and location in its representations of the city. This fixation, or, rather, the urgency of its mediation in not only artistic but also cultural, economic, and political arenas is inextricably linked to an ongoing elaboration of a Hong Kong identity. But assertions of “who we are” are often intimately related to suppositions of “where we are,” an idea captured in the<br>

Most basically, the Workgroup is a collection of prominent theologians that, in various configurations, have gathered periodically over the last forty years and collaboratively published four textbooks and one historical theology reader. Throughout its history, the Workgroup on Constructive Theology has variously defined itself, though never in very stark terms.

  Abstract: In this chapter I want to elaborate further on why thinking about democracy in an ordinary way, as suggested at the end of the previous chapter, should lead us away from supposing that there is a particular form of politics that is properly political, as if grasping this form would allow lesser forms to be characterized as postpolitical. In particular, I want to consider how best to understand the problem of deriving “context-transcending” principles from the specific situations in which the meanings of democratic politics are articulated. I take it for granted that this possibility can no longer be premised<br>

  Abstract: In his most vivid narrative of his hero’s life story, Plato has Socrates center his autobiography on an act of divination. The
                  Apologyshows a man driven by a provocative pronouncement from the Delphic oracle to devote his life to solving its riddle. Pleading his own defense before an Athenian jury, Socrates presents a carefully constructed speech, rich in mythological allusions. He compares himself to Achilles (28c) and likens his life’s work to a Herculean labor (22a).¹ A more subtle and also more powerful point of reference is another figure, the Theban hero Oedipus, whose life was as profoundly shaped<br>

  Abstract: In contrast to Plato, the surviving portion of Aristotle’s corpus is made up of his esoteric works—lectures, essays, and sometimes apparently just notes, meant for an audience already at the advanced stage. One salutary aspect is immediately apparent. Aristotle has little use for dramatic irony and deals with issues more directly and systematically than Plato does. On the other hand, the particular challenges for Aristotle’s readers are apparent as well. Whereas Plato could be said to present sometimes too many words, elaborating long and intricate lines of argument in which his investment remains indeterminate, Aristotle nearly always presents too<br>

  Book Title: Educación y capacidades: hacia un nuevo enfoque del desarrollo humano.-  Publisher: Dykinson<br>
  Author(s): Fuentes Juan Luis<br>
  Abstract: El último informe sobre la educación editado por la UNESCO en 2015 se titula Replantear la educación y comienza señalando la necesidad de oponerse al discurso dominante del desarrollo" al abordar la cuestión de los objetivos y las finalidades de la educación.Naturalmente no se trata de descalificar el esfuerzo por aumentar los recursos económicos de la sociedad, que eviten que la dignidad humana quede oscurecida por la falta de medios. De lo que se trata, precisamente, es de proporcionar a la dignidad los medios que necesita para llevar a plenitud el más profundo desarrollo de todas sus capacidades. Esto exige –a menos que usemos de modo vacío y estéril las palabras− conocer qué significa la dignidad humana y cuáles son las capacidades básicas de la persona que debemos promover. Ello permitirá conocer las características concretas que haya de tener una sociedad preocupada por el verdadero bien común y las grandes líneas que deben caracterizar a los sistemas educativos para colaborar en la gran tarea de una educación realmente plenificante.La Filosofía de la Educación debe estudiar estas cuestiones tratándolas desde el razonamiento público, en el respeto a las libertades y a las diversas particularidades de todas las personas.Tal es el objetivo de este libro, donde se agrupan trabajos originales de veintidós autores que, desde cuatro países distintos y trabajando en doce universidades diversas, proporcionan pistas y criterios que faciliten, usando una clásica terminología de la UNESCO, aprender a vivir juntos, pero, primeramente, aprender que la dignidad humana tiene una base ética, que mueve a cultivar las capacidades propias de la inteligencia, del carácter, y de la virtud, así como a prestar una especial atención al cuidado de esas capacidades en situaciones cuando nos encontramos ante situaciones de vulnerabilidad, señalando la misión que tiene la institución universitaria en el cultivo de todo ese conjunto de capacidades. José Antonio Ibáñez-Martín ejerció durante muchos años como Catedrático de Filosofía de la Educación de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

  Book Title: Cather Studies, Volume 11-Willa Cather at the Modernist Crux<br>
  Publisher: UNP - Nebraska<br>
  Author(s): Thacker Robert<br>
  Abstract: Willa Cather at the Modernist Cruxexamines Willa Cather's position in time, in aesthetics, and in the world. Born a Victorian in 1873, Cather made herself a modernist through the poems, stories, and novels she wrote and published into the twentieth century. Beginning with a prologue locating Cather's position, this volume of Cather Studies offers three sets of related essays.The first section takes up Cather's beginnings with her late nineteenth-century cultural influences. The second section explores a range of discernible direct connections with contemporary artists (Howard Pyle, Frederic Remington, and Ernest Blumenschein) and others who figured in the making of her texts. The third section focuses onThe Song of the Lark, a novel that confirms Cather's shift westward and elaborates her emergent modernism. An epilogue by the editors ofThe Selected Letters of Willa Catheraddresses how the recent availability of these letters has transformed Cather studies. Altogether, these essays detail Cather's shaping of the world of the early twentieth century and later into a singular modernism born of both inherited and newer cultural traditions.<br>

In the canyon she contemplates the vessels of pottery left by the ancient cliff dwellers, connecting them in her imagination with art in their ability to capture and contain life. As she examines the shards of broken pottery and recognizes herself as a vessel for art, she links the traditional women’s labor of carrying water to the creativity and confidence of creating art.

  Abstract: When it comes to video games, much attention is paid to representations of death. Game developers spill considerable digital blood crafting elaborate spectacles of violent demise in death-oriented games, while academics and the popular media spill equally as much ink debating the implications of those virtual fatalities. Avatars, visual representations of human players in these digital spaces, die repeatedly in games, such that experiences of dying become “part of the everyday life in the world” (Klastrup 144). However, in the context of this discussion and a medium in which death has so often been the focus, what about birth?<br>

  Abstract: This chapter derives from in-depth, longitudinal, collaborative and what is termed auto/biographical research among 25 general practitioners (GPs), or family physicians, working in demanding inner-city contexts, including inner London (West, 2001). The research focuses on the learning, role and wellbeing of such GPs during a time of changing roles and expectations, including within the management of healthcare in Britain, and a period of growing criticism over performance and levels of accountability.

  Author(s) Brownill Sue<br>
  Abstract: The issue of power is central to neighbourhood planning, yet it is also one of its most contested and debated areas. Implicit (and often explicit) within these debates is the notion of scale. The spatial metaphors that accompany these debates often suggest the idea of power moving up or down a vertical scale between the neighbourhood and a variety of levels of governance (Bailey and Pill, 2014) or horizontally through networked power relations along the lines of collaborative planning (Healey, 1987; Gallant and Robinson, 2012). These relations are seen as either enabling or constraining the possibilities for neighbourhoods to determine<br>

  Abstract: This volume, and the conference that produced it, have come at an apt historiographical moment. New data and new interpretations have led in recent years to something of a paradigm shift in how the Qing is viewed by historians of China (Rawski 1996). At the same time, the developing field of world history has been seeking new approaches to the last few centuries of accelerated global communication and integration, approaches that avoid “the West and the rest” dichotomies. Working China into such approaches has not been simple: while comparativists labor to relate China to frameworks based on European historical experience,¹<br>

  Abstract: Secondo modalità espressive differenti, Dostoevskij e Nietzsche hanno offerto, sul tema del valore (morale), una riflessione fondamentale e decisiva sviluppata non solo sul piano dell’analisi dei sentimenti morali e della coscienza morale, ma anche su quello della costruzione ed elaborazione di una prospettiva morale, diversa e lontana rispetto a quelle tradizionalmente prevalenti. Anche attraverso una reciproca integrazione delle loro rispettive posizioni – che, del resto, presentano aspetti comuni e convergenti –, la loro riflessione può contribuire a definire una proposta etica valida anche per il nostro tempo, per diversi tratti segnato o da un atteggiamento di indifferenza al problema del valore<br>

  Abstract: The Illiberal Imaginationoffers a synthetic, historical formalist account of how-and to what end-U.S. novels from the late eighteenth century to the mid-1850s represented economic inequality and radical forms of economic egalitarianism in the new nation. In conversation with intellectual, social, and labor history, this study tracks the representation of class inequality and conflict across five subgenres of the early U.S. novel: the Bildungsroman, the episodic travel narrative, the sentimental novel, the frontier romance, and the anti-slavery novel.<br>

At the outset of both novels, Brown’s protagonists—Constantia Dudley and Arthur Mervyn, respectively—fall into “poverty.” Having become “poor,” these protagonists must sell their labor to others in order to acquire “subsistence.” They become, then, members of late eighteenth-century Philadelphia’s “lower sort.” While Constantia and Arthur eventually—and fortuitously—ascend to property at<br>

  Abstract: The United States, as has been said for at least 100 years, is different from Europe. And it has been different, it has been said over and over again, because of the importance of the doctrine of laissez faire in the United States. This has been a society in which mobility and expansion (perhaps we could call it the frontier thesis in many ways) have played the role that politics and political negotiation and conflict have played in European societies. So, as it has often been noted, even labor in the United States never had an estate consciousness; rarely, in<br>

  Book Title: The Imaginary Revolution-Parisian Students and Workers in 1968<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Seidman Michael<br>
  Abstract: The events of 1968 have been seen as a decisive turning point in the Western world. The author takes a critical look at "May 1968" and questions whether the events were in fact as "revolutionary" as French and foreign commentators have indicated. He concludes the student movement changed little that had not already been challenged and altered in the late fifties and early sixties. The workers' strikes led to fewer working hours and higher wages, but these reforms reflected the secular demands of the French labor movement. "May 1968" was remarkable not because of the actual transformations it wrought but rather by virtue of the revolutionary power that much of the media and most scholars have attributed to it and which turned it into a symbol of a youthful, renewed, and freer society in France and beyond.<br>

  Abstract: The radical students who started the chain of events that led to the greatest strike wave in French history lashed out against capitalism, the state, and property. They extended their protests to what they considered the pleasure-denying restraints of bourgeois society and desired “to liberate man from all the repressions of social life.”¹ Repression meant not just police but a wide spectrum of social activities—wage labor, sexual restraint, industrial hierarchy, and academic discipline. As in other Western nations, universities became the launching pad of their assaults. The most liberal institution provided cover for adversaries of the dominant social/political order<br>

                  Nouvel Organonof 1764, baptized “phenomenology” as a discipline whose task is to allow the recognition of appearances and to furnish the means to escape them and arrive at the truth.¹ In the 1770 letter accompanying the copy of theDissertationhe sent to Lambert, Kant, situating himself in the framework of the traditional opposition between the sensible and intelligible worlds, also recognized the necessity of elaborating a “phaenomenologia generalis”<br>

  Book Title: The Forgiveness to Come-The Holocaust and the Hyper-Ethical<br>
  Publisher: Fordham University Press<br>
  Author(s): Berkowitz Roger<br>
  Abstract: Accompanied by Jacques Derrida's thought of forgiveness of the unforgivable, and its elaboration in relation to crimes against humanity, the book undertakes close readings of literary, philosophical, and cinematic texts by Simon Wiesenthal, Jean Améry, Vladimir Jankélévitch, Robert Antelme and Eva Mozes Kor. These texts contend with the idea that the crimes of the Nazis are inexpiable, that they lie beyond any possible atonement or repair. Banki argues that the juridical concept of crimes against humanity calls for a thought of forgiveness-one that would not imply closure of the infinite wounds of the past. How could such a forgiveness be thought or dreamed? Banki shows that if today we cannot simply escape the "worldwidization" of forgiveness, then it is necessary to rethink what forgiveness is, the conditions under which it supposedly takes place, and especially its relation to justice.<br>

  Author(s) HOKE JAMES N.<br>
  Abstract: The empire binds time. The idea of time being bound by institutions of power (ancient or modern) to have a normalizing effect, of course, comes from Elizabeth Freeman. She identifies such a binding as chrononormativity, “the use of time to organize individual human bodies toward maximum productivity.”¹ Under a modern capitalist system, for example, a normal “workday” is arranged (including “free” time) in such a way that workers produce more labor, and thus capital, for their employers. Chrononormativity, therefore, produces the most benefit for those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy.<br>

  CHAPTER 13  Dreaming: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xp3sfz">The Multiplicity of Dreams</a><br>
  Abstract: In beginning an overview of dreaming we could do worse than return to the nineteenth-century dream phenomenologists—who at least knew what later laboratory researchers and clinicians I I have forgotten, that description and classification are primary in science. DuPrel, Schemer, and Saint-Denys anticipated recent rating systems of dream bizarreness by calling attention to the positive and negative sides of dreaming. Dreaming tends always toward a delirium syndrome, but the corresponding impairment of verbal-reflective thinking allows a positive release of visual-spatial metaphor and intuition, the frames or modules of mind that are based on a relative simultaneity of expression.

  CHAPTER 1  “After Schmemann”: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xzh13v">Liturgical Theology after Schmemann</a><br>
  Abstract: We may begin with the commonplace premise that in Orthodox tradition the primary meaning of theology has been taken to be
                  prayeritself—the knowledge and experience of God acquired through participating in a relationship with him. Only secondarily does it imply (as the etymology indicates) “wordsaboutGod.”¹ Hence the notion ofliturgicaltheology, thetheologia primadiscussed above, whose elaboration was, of course, the goal of Fr.

  Abstract: Given his interest in complex semiotic structures and in a “semiosphere” whose ever ramifying interactions model the vast physical cosmos, it is not surprising that Yury Lotman paused in his writings to discuss the most elaborate of all texts, the worlds within worlds of Dante’s
                  La Divina Commedia.Indeed, these two authors seem almost made for each other, for their passion for meaning (and meaning making) against a moving backdrop of epistemology and geo-and astrophysics are uncannily similar.

  Abstract: As Alfred Appel effectively demonstrated in
                  Nabokov’s Dark Cinema, cinematographic allusions and references are omnipresent in Nabokov’s fiction.²Lolita, however, is a special case not only because it employs multiple cinematic correlations and images, but also because of Nabokov’s involvement in 1959-1960 in the “cinemizing”—to use his own term—of his famous novel. The result of his well-known collaboration with Stanley Kubrick was the acclaimed motion picture Lolita (which left Nabokov with a “mixture of aggravation, regret, and reluctant pleasure” as well as the discovery that “Kubrick was a great director”)³ based on Nabokov’s original screenplay, of which very<br>

  Abstract: Esta obra presenta un estudio teórico-práctico de las normas de procedimiento aplicables ante cinco mecanismos de solución de controversias internacionales, seleccionados como aquellos que representan los diferentes ámbitos de la justicia internacional. En ese sentido, el texto desarrolla el litigio y procedimiento ante: la Corte Internacional de Justicia (cij); el Sistema Interamericano de Protección de los Derechos Humanos (sidh) en su conjunto —que incluye a la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (IDH) y a la Comisión Interamericana de Derechos Humanos (CIDH)—; la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI; el Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI) y el Órgano de Solución de Diferencias de la Organización Mundial del Comercio (OMC). A partir del estudio de documentos primarios se presenta el procedimiento seguido ante cada tribunal o mecanismo internacional, de manera tal que constituya para el lector un estudio integral, coherente y sistemático de los métodos judiciales y cuasi-judiciales a nivel internacional, en lo relativo al procedimiento, competencia, jurisdicción y demás aspectos procesales y probatorios, a partir del cual los operadores jurídicos podrán guiar sus labores ante cada mecanismo de justicia internacional. Además de la parte orgánica y operativa esta obra identifica los principales problemas jurídicos que se presentan en la práctica del litigio internacional y analiza, desde una perspectiva crítica, el funcionamiento y desarrollo de las actividades jurisdiccionales de los tribunales internacionales objeto de estudio. De forma transversal, se da una respuesta al problema jurídico planteado a partir del marco teórico que proponen los estudios sobre la fragmentación del derecho internacional, particularmente a partir de aquellos que ha realizado la Comisión de Derecho Internacional de la onu, así como los diferentes pronunciamientos de los tribunales y mecanismos internacionales. de los tribunales y mecanismos internacionales.<br>

  3  Irigaray’s To Be Two: from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1zxz0w2">Feminist Philosophy and the Problem of Evil</a><br>
  Author(s) Jaarsma Ada S.<br>
  Abstract: As this epigraph signals, an awareness of “sin” emerges out of Luce Irigaray’s central assertion of sexual difference as the essential ethical and philosophical problem. Irigaray asserts that a rejection or refutation of sexual difference risks committing an ultimate sin. Through this claim, we can glimpse a problematic of evil emerging out of Irigaray’s project that cannot be easily or quickly delimited. Irigaray herself traverses this problematic in her texts, elaborating sources of brokenness and violence as well as concomitant possibilities for regeneration (see, e.g., 1993b, 1993d, and 1996). Rather than mobilizing traditional concepts like “moral evil” or “natural evil,”<br>

  Book Title: Trauma in First Person-Diary Writing during the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Indiana University Press<br>
  Author(s): GREENBERG AVNER<br>
  Abstract: What are the effects of radical oppression on the human psyche? What happens to the inner self of the powerless and traumatized victim, especially during times of widespread horror? In this bold and deeply penetrating book, Amos Goldberg addresses diary writing by Jews under Nazi persecution. Throughout Europe, in towns, villages, ghettos, forests, hideouts, concentration and labor camps, and even in extermination camps, Jews of all ages and of all cultural backgrounds described in writing what befell them. Goldberg claims that diary and memoir writing was perhaps the most important literary genre for Jews during World War II. Goldberg considers the act of writing in radical situations as he looks at diaries from little-known victims as well as from brilliant diarists such as Chaim Kaplan and Victor Klemperer. Goldberg contends that only against the background of powerlessness and inner destruction can Jewish responses and resistance during the Holocaust gain their proper meaning.<br>

  Abstract: In the preceding pages, I have elaborated and illustrated a theory of musical narrative that is both grounded in principles applicable to narrative media in general and organized around discourses that are specifically musical. In place of the subtle and not-so-subtle distortions arising from a literature-based approach to narrative, this book reconstitutes the fundamentals of narrative theory in terms of Liszkian transvaluation, recognizing that the shifting hierarchical organization of our various “cultures”—psychic, interpersonal, social—lies at the heart of our subject.<br>

  Abstract: HANNAH ARENDT’S REFLECTIONS on judgment, which she qualifies as the most political of all of the human being’s faculties, are intimately tied to a debate over Kant’s philosophy that spans almost two decades. Central to this debate is the Kantian distinction between determinant (i.e., cognitive) judgment and reflective (i.e., aesthetic or teleological) judgment. Arendt’s own conception of judgment originates largely from her interest in and her commentaries on Kant’s elaboration of the judgment of taste in the

  Abstract: FROM WHAT WE have seen so far, Arendt’s theory of judgment sketches out a novel conception of a kind of mental activity that she holds Kant to have unwittingly discovered when he came across the judgment of taste. This kind of judgment, which lies behind the reflective judgment of taste and is not identical with it, concerns appearances. What Arendt calls appearances can be retraced to Kant’s transcendental aesthetics, in which he elaborated on the a priori forms constitutive of phenomena of nature that are to be subsequently subsumed by the determinant judgment under the discursive conditions of cognition, that<br>

  Abstract: Ion Antonescu was the leader of the Romanian state from September 1940 to August 1944. From September 1940 to January 1941 he shared power with the far-right Legionary Movement in what was called the National Legionary State. The collaboration between Antonescu and the legionaries did not last, and conflicts between the two sides became frequent as the abuses of the legionaries were increasingly apparent. In January 1941 Antonescu crushed the attempt of the former government partners to oust him, and, counting on his slightly unclear agreement with Hitler, managed to stay in power.

  Abstract: During the first decade of his reflection (1964–74), Bruaire elaborated a systematic anthropology whose outcome is the recognition that man’s very existence is indicative of a constitutive givenness. The interesting aspect of Bruaire’s remarkable speculative effort in search of what is distinctly human, however, is that his anthropology is forged within and apart from Hegel’s system. Hegel’s influence can be perceived at every step of Bruaire’s reflection: the circular movement of self-determination, the structure and patterns of speculative thought, the search for a unity between the finite and the absolute spirit that does not obliterate the differences, the role<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt2851gx">Necessity and Possibility</a><br>
  Abstract: It is not uncommon in introductory philosophy courses to receive a picture of Kant that paints him as a paradigmatic old-fashioned, detached Prussian scholar, whose walks were so predictable that the residents of Königsberg could set their clocks by them, and whose life passed as the most regular of regular verbs. Such an image is reinforced by the overwhelming attention to what might be called the “positive” dimension of Kant’s philosophy, for example, the Transcendental Analytic. There we find obscure arguments couched in arcane, inscrutable terminology, as well as intricate, elaborate proofs of synthetic a priori concepts and principles. All<br>

Churchmen, in the early modern age, were also to be the blood and sinews of temporal governance; in Rome, it was they who held power and went out to far places to represent the state. They were therefore the messengers and witnesses of the double authority upholding papal monarchy, an authority defined and defended in those years by every means at hand.

To make the first experimental films, he built a set in their offices in Brooklyn.

When Henderson’s seminar commenced in 1932, the institutional status of psychology at Harvard was just as uncertain as that of sociology, anthropology, and business administration. Since the 1870s, when William James established in Cambridge the nation’s first psychological laboratory, psychology at Harvard had existed in “forced cohabitation” with philosophy.¹ Very much the junior partner in this alliance, psychology would not attain independent departmental standing until 1934.

The humans consider the androids, which they callreplicants,to be nothing more than multifaceted machines.

  Abstract: IN ORDINARY CONVERSATION, speakers take turns at talk that usually consist of one turn constructional unit, and then speaker exchange occurs (Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974). In telling a story, a speaker produces more than one turn constructional unit. To do this, a prospective storyteller (sometimes in collaboration with prospective recipients), indicates that there is a story to tell, and may be granted the conversational floor for an extended turn (Jefferson 1978; Sacks 1978). As a storytelling proceeds, the ends of turn constructional units may provide opportunities for, or make relevant, turns by recipients. As I discuss below, these recipient<br>

  Abstract: The work of categorization left by scholars through the ages is phenomenal. Specialists in the foundations of law and jurisprudence (
                  usul al-fiqh), who labored at this exercise of extrapolating and categorizing rules on the basis of a reading that was both careful to be faithful to the norm and profoundly rational, have bequeathed to us an unparalleled heritage. A careful reading of these works reveals that very precise modes of grasping the sources were set down very early. Consideration of the language was supported by a double process of distinguishing on the one hand between the unequivocal and the equivocal<br>

  Book Title: Troubling Natural Categories-Engaging the Medical Anthropology of Margaret Lock<br>
  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): KIELMANN KARINA<br>
  Abstract: Where do our conventional understandings of health, illness, and the body stem from? What makes them authoritative? How are the boundaries set around these areas of life unsettled in the changing historical and political contexts of science, technology, and health care delivery? These questions are at the heart of Troubling Natural Categories, a collection of essays honouring the tradition of Margaret Lock, one of the preeminent medical anthropologists of our time. Throughout her career, Lock has investigated how medicine sets boundaries around what is deemed "normal" and "natural," and how, in turn, these ideas shape our technical and moral understandings of life, sickness, and death. In this book, nine established medical anthropologists - all former students of Lock - critically engage with her work, offering ethnographic and historical analyses that problematize taken-for-granted constructs in health and medicine in a range of global settings. The essays elaborate cutting-edge themes within medical anthropology, including the often disturbing, inherently political nature of biomedicine and biotechnology, the medicalization of mental health processes, and the formation of uniquely "local biologies" through the convergence of bodily experience, scientific discourse, and new technologies of care. Troubling Natural Categories not only affirms Margaret Lock's place at the forefront of scholarship but, with these essays, carves out new intellectual directions in the medical social sciences. Contributors include Sean Brotherton, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, Junko Kitanaka, Stephanie Lloyd, Dominique Behague, and Annette Leibing.<br>

  Abstract: A political literary criticism is not the invention of marxists. On the contrary, it is one of the oldest, most venerable forms of literary criticism we know. The most widespread early criticism on historical record was not, in our sense, “aesthetic”: it was a mode of what we would now call “discourse theory,” devoted to analyzing the material effects of particular uses of language in particular social conjunctures. It was a highly elaborate theory of specific signifying practices—above all, of the discursive practices of the juridical, political, and religious apparatuses of the state.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bfxq">Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics</a><br>
  Abstract: In making language the essence of hermeneutics Gadamer clearly follows the later Heidegger’s radicalization of historical thrownness. His aim, however, is to reconcile this radicalization with the young Heidegger’s hermeneutical starting point, namely, understanding. Specifically, given that we are situated in a history articulated in linguistic tradition, what are the consequences for human understanding and self-knowledge? These consequences are elaborated in “The Ontological Shift of Hermeneutics Guided by Language,” the title of the last third of Gadamer’s magnum opus,

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt32bn3t">Pushkin's Historical Imagination</a><br>
  Abstract: The analysis of the relationship between history and fiction—a problem that has stimulated European thought since the time of Aristotle, was developed by Vico, and then elaborated in structural and post-structural theory—has special relevance in the Russian context in general and for the study of Pushkin in particular.

  Abstract: Before proceeding further in exploring the varieties of presentational states and their relation to cognitive theory, we must consider the more ordinary forms of visual-spatial imagery and their place in that wider context. After all, it was the initial attempts at empirical laboratory research on visual imagery that were heralded as a “return of the ostracized” (Holt, 1962) — the beginning of modern psychology’s renewed interest in consciousness. Holt, among many others, hoped for a cognitive theory that would include the full range of phenomenological and clinical studies of imagistic states along with a laboratory science of imagery.

  Abstract: For a long time, the historical precedence of the Bible vis-à-vis the Qurʾan polarized the question of their interrelationship, reducing it solely to influence and borrowing, or even, in the case of extreme polemics, to plagiarism and parody. And yet, a simple shift in perspective allows us to view the question in a completely different light. In fact, the Qurʾanic text elaborates a discourse on its own status as scripture and on its relation to previous revelations. By starting with what the Qurʾan says about scriptural context, we find a whole universe of thought opening up to us, one that<br>

  Abstract: “I think fiction rescues history from its confusions.” This tentative assertion in one of the rare interviews with Don DeLillo could draw a hail of objections from historians, as it insinuates, with confident and serious nonchalance (DeLillo’s characteristic style), that history is confused.

  Abstract: Psychology, the study of the soul, held a particular fascination for Avicenna. That the subject clearly lies near the heart of his concern for philosophy is indicated by the fact that he devoted numerous major and minor tracts to the subject and returned repeatedly to its elaboration throughout his life.¹ Avicenna’s psychological doctrines are stable in their general parameters, but his individual presentations of them differ according to considerations of philosophical intent, generic format, and audience of address.² Like any psychology aspiring to comprehensiveness, Avicenna’s theory addresses four considerations:<br>

  Abstract: It’s customary to credit Poe with elaborating all the conventions of detective fiction that subsequent practitioners of the genre have followed to a greater or lesser degree.¹ Yet Poe’s privileged role as founder or father of a literary genre—a role perhaps unique in literary history—has obscured the fact that he marks what can now be recognized as a first phase of the genre’s development. Key works of detective fiction in the twentieth century, especially in its latter half, represent a distinct departure from Poe’s “tales of ratiocination” and, indeed, from traditional hermeneutics.² Before we can delineate this later<br>

  Abstract: In Western cinema, food and drink have often served as symbols for life and sensuality. The enjoyment of food is used to celebrate the pure physical joy of life and sensuality, reminding us of our immediate corporeal sensations, and affirming the vitality of human life. A number of films about food use food imagery in a “carnivalesque” fashion: in Babette’s Feast (Gabriel Axel, Denmark, 1987), the maid of two minister’s daughters wins the lottery and spends the entire sum on an elaborate banquet for her Lutheran employers and their church community.

  Abstract: Atom Egoyan’s second feature film Family Viewing (1987) presents many different thematic issues and narrative devices, which the Canadian filmmaker has continued to elaborate on. The family always appears in his work; Egoyan always explores it, albeit in different terms, forms, and intensity, in relation to visual media. In this respect, a close reading of this particular film, relevantly entitled Family Viewing, will serve to display the relationship between “family” and “viewing” or, more specifically, between the Armenian family and the videographic medium.

  Book Title: The Children's Table-Childhood Studies and the Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Georgia Press<br>
  Author(s): DUANE ANNA MAE<br>
  Abstract: Like the occupants of the children's table at a family dinner, scholars working in childhood studies can seem sidelined from the "adult" labor of humanities scholarship. The Children's Table brings together scholars from architecture, philosophy, law, and literary and cultural criticism to provide an overview of the innovative work being done in childhood studies-a transcript of what is being said at the children's table. Together, these scholars argue for rethinking the academic seating arrangement in a way that acknowledges the centrality of childhood to the work of the humanities. The figure we now recognize as a child was created in tandem with forms of modernity that the Enlightenment generated and that the humanities are now working to rethink. Thus the growth of childhood studies allows for new approaches to some of the most important and provocative issues in humanities scholarship: the viability of the social contract, the definition of agency, the performance of identity, and the construction of gender, sexuality, and race. Because defining childhood is a means of defining and distributing power and obligation, studying childhood requires a radically altered approach to what constitutes knowledge about the human subject. The diverse essays in The Children's Table share a unifying premise: to include the child in any field of study realigns the shape of that field, changing the terms of inquiry and forcing a different set of questions. Taken as a whole, the essays argue that, at this key moment in the state of the humanities, rethinking the child is both necessary and revolutionary.

  Abstract: In this chapter I argue that the ideas, practices, and institutions of historical preservation reverberate with conceptions of childhood. I find these connections to be mutually illuminating, productive not only for the comparatively new field of childhood studies but also for the many disciplinary and institutional structures through which we have tried to locate origins and to access, understand, preserve, and recall a time that is gone. For scholarship in the humanities the “archival turn” proves to have much in common with the study of childhood: both elaborate the repositories of our cultural and personal pasts.

  Abstract: Each culture has its own preferences or rules as to what constitutes the formal orderings of a lyric. For much of the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, poetry in English was felt to be most properly constituted by accentual syllabic meter and rhyme. On the other hand, Chinese lyric poetry of the T’ang dynasty (700–950 A.D.) was defined by a whole different set of formal concepts. It not only had to have a set number of characters per line and a set number of lines (eight), but also had to exhibit an elaborate syntactical patterning: the four lines in the<br>

Absent the assumption of functional commonalities, one could only speak responsibly of a bioregional culture by celebrating its cultural artifacts and practices without<br>

  Book Title: The Archaeology of Class War-The Colorado Coalfield Strike of 1913-1914<br>
  Publisher: University Press of Colorado<br>
  Author(s): McGuire Randall H.<br>
  Abstract: The Archaeology of the Colorado Coalfield War Project has conducted archaeological investigations at the site of the Ludlow Massacre in Ludlow, Colorado, since 1996. With the help of the United Mine Workers of America and funds from the Colorado State Historical Society and the Colorado Endowment for the Humanities, the scholars involved have integrated archaeological finds with archival evidence to show how the everyday experiences of miners and their families shaped the strike and its outcome.The Archaeology of Class War weaves together material culture, documents, oral histories, landscapes, and photographs to reveal aspects of the strike and life in early twentieth-century Colorado coalfields unlike any standard documentary history. Excavations at the site of the massacre and the nearby town of Berwind exposed tent platforms, latrines, trash dumps, and the cellars in which families huddled during the attack. Myriad artifacts—from canning jars to a doll’s head—reveal the details of daily existence and bring the community to life.The Archaeology of Class War will be of interest to archaeologists, historians, and general readers interested in mining and labor history.<br>

  Abstract: The Colorado Coalfield War Archaeology Project (CCWAP) strove to complement the written history of the 1913–1914 labor strike in southern Colorado. While the written history provides a thorough description of the events and their larger implications, it does not paint a complete picture of how the events affected the daily lives of the men, women, and children who experienced them. Further, it cannot show the living conditions that led up to the strike or illustrate the strike’s effect on the material conditions of the workers and their families. Such is the nature of history.

  Abstract: The Ludlow Project is an explicitly political project, an attempt to fuse scholarly labor with working-class interests (Ludlow Collective 2001:95). The goal of working with union members and organized labor, an audience outside the traditional realm of archaeology, confronts us with a history little studied by archaeologists and little taught within general historical education. The Ludlow Massacre, like many historical episodes, is a silenced history, written out to the margins of national history. The Ludlow Massacre helped change the lives of working-class people throughout the United States, so its absence in official history, and the absence of events like it,<br>

Drawing from ethnographic data and research in three immigrant communities, Marjorie Faulstich Orellana's study expands the definition of child labor by assessing children's roles as translators as part of a cost equation in an era of global restructuring and considers how sociocultural learning and development is shaped as a result of children's contributions as translators.<br>

  Book Title: Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory-Collected Essays of Werner H. Kelber<br>
  Publisher: SBL Press<br>
  Author(s): Kelber Werner H.<br>
  Abstract: Jesus and his followers defined their allegiances and expressed their identities in a communications culture that manifested itself in voice and chirographic practices, in oral-scribal interfaces, and in performative activities rooted in memory. In the sixteen essays gathered in Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory, Werner Kelber explores the verbal arts of early Christian word processing operative in a media world that was separated by two millennia from our contemporary media history. The title articulates the fact that the ancient culture of voiced texts, hand-copying, and remembering is chiefly accessible to us in print format and predominantly assimilated from print perspectives. The oral-scribal-memorial-performative paradigm developed in these essays challenges the reigning historical-critical model in biblical scholarship. Notions of tradition, the fixation on the single original saying, the dominant methodology of form criticism, and the heroic labors of the Quest—stalwart features of the historical, documentary paradigm—are all subject to a critical review. A number of essays reach beyond New Testament texts, ranging from the pre-Socratic Gorgias through medieval manuscript culture on to print’s triumphant apotheosis in Gutenberg’s Vulgate, product of the high tech of the fifteenth century, all the way to conflicting commemorations of Auschwitz—taking tentative steps toward a history of media technologies, culture, and cognition of the Christian tradition in the West.<br>

I continue to view it as a puzzle that admits of no simple or general answer. The very oddness of the theme ought to have inspired creative explorations, whereas, in fact, it has often given rise to evasive maneuvers. The elaboration of admittedly positive features of the disciples is, of course, very much to the point. But it has not<br>

These political scientists reconceptualize

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vjkzw">French Studies in and for the 21st Century</a><br>
  Author(s) Vialleton Elodie<br>
  Abstract: At the Open University, French is taught by the largest but least conventional department of languages in the UK. Numbers of language students are now approaching 10,000 a year, which translates into over 3,000 full-time equivalent student (FTEs) numbers. In terms of recruitment, whether actual students or FTEs, the Open University is also the largest French department in the UK. This chapter describes our distinctive and innovative approach to teaching French, and our related research activities. It opens by setting language learning in the context of supported distance education, and concludes by proposing wider inter-university collaboration in the context of<br>

  Book Title: Heidegger and the Thinking of Place-Explorations in the Topology of Being<br>
  Publisher: The MIT Press<br>
  Author(s): Malpas Jeff<br>
  Abstract: The idea of place--topos--runs through Martin Heidegger's thinking almost from the very start. It can be seen not only in his attachment to the famous hut in Todtnauberg but in his constant deployment of topological terms and images and in the situated, "placed" character of his thought and of its major themes and motifs. Heidegger's work, argues Jeff Malpas, exemplifies the practice of "philosophical topology." In Heidegger and the Thinking of Place, Malpas examines the topological aspects of Heidegger's thought and offers a broader elaboration of the philosophical significance of place. Doing so, he provides a distinct and productive approach to Heidegger as well as a new reading of other key figures--notably Kant, Aristotle, Gadamer, and Davidson, but also Benjamin, Arendt, and Camus. Malpas, expanding arguments he made in his earlier book Heidegger's Topology (MIT Press, 2007), discusses such topics as the role of place in philosophical thinking, the topological character of the transcendental, the convergence of Heideggerian topology with Davidsonian triangulation, the necessity of mortality in the possibility of human life, the role of materiality in the working of art, the significance of nostalgia, and the nature of philosophy as beginning in wonder. Philosophy, Malpas argues, begins in wonder and begins in place and the experience of place. The place of wonder, of philosophy, of questioning, he writes, is the very topos of thinking.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5vkdz2">Researching Dance</a><br>
  Author(s) Stinson Susan W.<br>
  Abstract: Often, when people think of research, they think of the tradition of the natural sciences that began during the Enlightenment: an attempt to go beyond the word of God, tradition, folklore, and other nonempirical sources of knowledge. Scientific research is based on an assumption that the world is a predictable place, if only we can determine the laws by which it operates. Most of us were introduced to the guidelines of such research in secondary school, and they were elaborated in each science course from then on, as well as in most graduate research courses. We learned that good science<br>

  Abstract: IN MID-APRIL Brodsky was released from the transit prison in Arkhangelsk to his place of exile in Konosha district, Arkhangelsk region. The transit prison with its abusive guards was a genuine ordeal; life in exile turned out to be less hard. Meanwhile, Western journalists describing Brodsky’s lot talked of the “Gulag” and “Arctic labor camps”—which in the minds of readers foggy on Russian geography and the realities of Soviet life called up visions of permanent winter and ragged convicts in shackles.¹<br>

  Abstract: To give preference to the judicial archive presupposes a choice, and presents an itinerary; to make it the sole basis of one’s research or to bring it into the historical debate as one’s principal interlocutor is not altogether natural. Why deny it? There’s certainly something a little quaint about spending years of research obstinately parsing reports of lives led centuries ago, even as increasingly elaborate new ways of thinking about history are all the while being formulated and reformulated. But we should not forget to what extent the judicial archives themselves made many of these breakthroughs possible in the first<br>

  Author(s) FREUDENTHAL GIDEON<br>
  Abstract: The title of this essay is intended to express, first, the claim that Cassirer’s project is indeed philosophical and systematic (and not merely historical); second, that this philosophy has a core principle; and third, that this core is not elaborated nor applied to the cultural material which it was supposed to explain. Thus Cassirer’s oeuvre shows, on the one hand, the blueprint of a systematic historical epistemology and, on the other hand, the material which should have been interpreted and explained by this epistemology. The material is ordered so as to suggest a progressive epistemic development, but Cassirer nowhere applies<br>

  Abstract: Over the last two decades there has been an increasing tendency for artists to seek partnerships with academics and vice versa.¹ Exchange projects like artist-in-residency programmes at universities have become common practice and there are many organizations that initiate and actively promote collaboration between artists and academics.² To stimulate theoretical reflection on this development, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) launched in 2006 the CO-OPs programme.

  Abstract: In the tumultuous years between 1947 and 1950, the French photojournalist Henri Cartier-Bresson crossed the Bay of Bengal twice. Cartier-Bresson’s Asian sojourn produced the iconic images of his career: the line of people outside a Shanghai bank on the eve of the Communist victory, the journey of Gandhi’s ashes through India, portraits of Asia’s new leaders.

  Introduction from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpr8v">The Economics of Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: Labor is a familiar subject for study in the social sciences. The literature is replete with studies of occupations, careers, labor markets, contractual relations in employment, unemployment, the relations between training and professionalization, and various aspects of remuneration, including its distribution, its relation to investments in training, and its evolution in individuals’ careers. When the labor in question is artistic, however, such analysis is somewhat harder to find. This no doubt reflects the unusual nature of artistic labor.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Is Working to Achieve Self-Fulfillment Rational? from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt6wpr8v">The Economics of Creativity</a><br>
  Abstract: In classical economic analysis, labor is generally treated as a negative magnitude. It is described restrictively as a “disutility,” an expense of individual energy in exchange for a salary and the consumer goods to which that salary provides access. Leisure and consumer goods are the only sources of satisfaction and individual well-being. Thus labor is reduced to “negative consumption.” When labor is described this way, involvement in the labor market becomes a case of rational behavior and maximization under constraint: The choice to engage in a remunerated activity can be understood entirely as a choice balancing the sacrifice of well-being<br>

  Book Title: Mediating Across Difference-Oceanic and Asian Approaches to Conflict Resolution<br>
  Publisher: University of Hawaii Press<br>
  Author(s): Bleiker Roland<br>
  Abstract: To address the ensuing challenges, this book introduces and explores some of the rich insights into conflict resolution emanating from Asia and Oceania. Although often overlooked, these local traditions offer a range of useful ways of thinking about and dealing with difference and conflict in a globalizing world. To bring these traditions into exchange with mainstream Western conflict resolution, the editors present the results of collaborative work between experienced scholars and culturally knowledgeable practitioners from numerous parts of Asia and Oceania. The result is a series of interventions that challenge conventional Western notions of conflict resolution and provide academics, policy makers, diplomats, mediators, and local conflict workers with new possibilities to approach, prevent, and resolve conflict.<br>

My emphasis in this section will be on the fate of those individuals who were caught in the system and obliged both to think of themselves and to present themselves to others in class terms.

  Abstract: This article develops some examples of interpretation in medical practice. I begin with medical data, but need to first provide some definitions to pave the way for more explicit development. Some of these defined terms have nontechnical meanings, but for our purposes they need to be clarified further. Examples will include manifestations (symptoms, signs, and laboratory results) as well as “disease.” I then explore the problem of noticing and interpreting a manifestation as “abnormal.” This will raise valuational issues for the interpretation, as well as allow us to briefly survey several approaches to the notion of disease in medicine.

This remarkable combination of traditionalism and innovation describes a state elusively beyond any linguistic epistemology—yet resident in any experiential event—and offers a method to capture individual experience of “pure immanence.”¹ The emphasis Deleuze placed on event and experience stimulated the energetic analysis of their interrelations by Alain Badiou, turning philosophy away from cognitive mapping through Kantian categorical imperatives and re/turning it to the world.

He studied law both in his country of birth and in France, and he served as a probation officer in Fort-de-France before working as a librarian with young prisoners in France. Chamoiseau collaborated with his fellow countryman Raphaël Confiant and Jean Bernabé on the literary manifesto
                  Eloge de la Créolité; the three authors are considered the primary partisans of Créolité, the theory of French West Indian literature, culture, and identity. In this chapter, I demonstrate thatAntan d’enfance,one of a series of autobiographies by Chamoiseau, uses orality<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7pds6">Religion after Religion</a><br>
  Abstract: One must study the totality of Corbin’s published work to understand that this great Islamicist was something other than an Islamicist.¹ He wrote what he came to call “prophetic philosophy,” a kind of esoteric science complemented by the acceptable apparatus of footnotes.² Influences on this elaborate conception, however, have not yet been traced in full, though many of them are by now well known. Corbin’s esoterism blended medieval philosophy, occultism, History of Religions, Lutheran theology, Shi‘ite ideology, into a brilliantly polished, absolutely authentic, and utterly irreproducible mixture. It is my conviction that he may have been the most sophisticated and<br>

  Author(s) BOZARTH GEORGE S.<br>
  Abstract: The real interest of the evening centered upon the Brahms Symphony, which stood at the head of the programme. There is no living musician about whose compositions there is a greater variety of opinions, or these opinions more changeable, than the same Johannes Brahms. People whose patience is limited, and whose ears itch for taking melodies—well or ill elaborated—may find enchantment at a first hearing of such limpid works as Raff’s “Leonore” Symphony. But let a Brahms “Requiem,” or wonderfully complex and original variations, or symphony, for the first time sound forth, and they will compare the work to muddy<br>

  Abstract: One evening at Jacob’s Pillow, an exclusive dance theatre in the Berkshires hills of western Massachusetts, a musical concert offered an interlude in the summer’s regular lineup of performances. On stage, in a space normally reserved for the dance, renowned musician Jali Foday Musa Suso appeared along with a North American flutist. Together they offered a concert of Mandinka music. The assembled audience that evening had little familiarity with the type of music performed, but they sat and listened attentively. Perhaps a few had heard of Suso because of his musical collaborations with contemporary musicians/composers Phillip Glass and Herbie Hancock.<br>

The slow opening to the day had taxi vans and buses making their way through the main street bringing people from the surrounding areas to work. Some of the men, civil servants, were dressed in dark Western-style suits and others in gray nationalist “African” suits and plain cotton shirts and trousers. Scattered among the civil servants in their modern attire were jali, many of whom appeared distinctive because they were wearing brightly colored, elaborately embroidered robes.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s8h3">Writing Outside the Nation</a><br>
  Abstract: The words of the eighteenth-century German Romantic poet Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) resonate beyond the boundaries of their history and geography and are poignantly rearticulated by a contemporary master of the arts of memory. Salman Rushdie’s critical sentiment stands as a testimony to the labor of remembrance that reclaims the lost experience of another time and place in language and imagination. The work of commemoration is often the only means of releasing our (hi)stories from subjugation to official or institutionalized regimes of forgetting.

  Abstract: An active European site of fiery debates, where stakes in labor migration, immigration, patriation, and national and ethnic identity politics are very high, is the reunified German state. At this historical juncture, over six million foreigners, including Gastarbeiter (guest workers), refugees, asylum seekers, writers, artists, and professionals are permanently settled in Germany. In the embattled Europe of the post-cold-war era, Germany, with its economic power, political stability, generous welfare system, and what until recently were very flexible asylum laws, has become, perhaps quite unwittingly and unwillingly, the destination for a growing body of dis- placed peoples.

  Book Title: William Faulkner-An Economy of Complex Words<br>
  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Godden Richard<br>
  Abstract: In
         William Faulkner, Richard Godden traces how the novelist's late fiction echoes the economic and racial traumas of the South's delayed modernization in the mid-twentieth century. As the New Deal rapidly accelerated the long-term shift from tenant farming to modern agriculture, many African Americans were driven from the land and forced to migrate north. At the same time, white landowners exchanged dependency on black labor for dependency on northern capital. Combining powerful close readings ofThe Hamlet, Go Down, Moses, andA Fablewith an examination of southern economic history from the 1930s to the 1950s, Godden shows how the novels' literary complexities--from their narrative structures down to their smallest verbal emphases--reflect and refract the period's economic complexities. By demonstrating the interrelation of literary forms and economic systems, the book describes, in effect, the poetics of an economy.<br>

The point at issue between Mink Snopes and Jack Houston is a fence.¹ Unfenced or open range represented for Mink, and the southern tenantry, access to common use rights. Whereas, the principle, “fence stock, not crop,” served the interests of owners such as Houston. Varner, the magistrate, “fence rail…, thin,”² decides for Houston.

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7sb40">William Faulkner</a><br>
  Abstract: THE Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1933 initiated the transformation of southern labor and its place, prompting a labor revolution, driven by federal funds, and effectively exorcising black from white. To read sociological commentators in the early 1930s, addressing southern agriculture, is to hear black tenants described as “virtual slaves,” held “in thrall,” subjected to “almost complete dependence” and “incapable of ever achieving but a modicum of self direction.”¹ Although the Civil War had freed the slave, it had done so only for southern landowners to bind him again in an alternative form of “dependency”: for chattel slavery read debt<br>

  Book Title: Slavery and the Culture of Taste-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Gikandi Simon<br>
  Abstract: Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure.<br>

This figure emerges at the intersection of three domains—life, labor, and language—unstably unified around, and constituting, a would-be sovereignsubject. The doubling of a transcendental subject and an empirical object and their dynamic and unstable relations defined the form of this being. In 1966, Foucault held an epochal view of Man and of modernity. In his conclusion, Foucault intimated the imminent coming of a new<br>

  Author(s) FINNIS JOHN<br>
  Abstract: Law, and a legalistic morality and politics, can define peace and war by their mutual opposition. Any two communities are either at peace or at war with one another. If they are at war, each is seeking a relationship to the other (ʺvictory over,ʺ ʺprevailing overʺ) which that other seeks precisely to frustrate or overcome. If they are at peace, each pursues its own concerns in a state of indifference to, noninterference in, or collaboration with the concerns of the other.<br>

  CHAPTER TWO  Telling Time in War from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7t6rs">War at a Distance</a><br>
  Abstract: This chapter extends the thought that the experience of war at a distance, of a mediated war, is fundamentally dislocating, and that such dislocation expresses itself most frequently and forcefully through our sense of the movement (or stasis) of time, through temporalities. Thus the wartime poems set on a winter’s evening, considered in the prelude, elaborate the simplest markers of time (winter, evening) into channels of memory and prophecy, avenues of recursivity and nodes of stillness. Wartime in modernity refers not to a single temporal mode—
                  thetime of war. Rather it houses many temporalities, each one, as we will<br>

To improve the conditions of poor people in Chicago would take the help of city hall and eventually even the federal government.

When we allow a tyrant to get control of our spirits or our cities, the first thing he will do is put us to work at backbreaking and stultifying tasks. Blake felt the tyranny of the English Church and state not only in its censorship and prosecution of radical writers but also in the way it governed public taste, driving radical artists to drudgery for the market.

  Book Title: What's Happened to the Humanities?-  Publisher: Princeton University Press<br>
  Author(s): Kernan Alvin<br>
  Abstract: This volume of specially commissioned original essays presents the thoughts of some of the most distinguished commentators within the American academy on the fundamental changes that have taken place in the humanities in the latter part of the twentieth century. In the transformation of American higher education from the university to the "demoversity," the humanities have become a less and less important part of education, a matter established by a statistical appendix and elaborated on in several of the essays. The individual essays offer close observations into how the humanities have been affected by declining academic status, by demographic shifts, by reductions in financial support, and by changing communication technology. They also explore the effect of these forces on books, libraries, and the phenomenology of reading in the age of images. When basic conditions change, theory follows, and several essays trace the appearance and effect of new relativistic epistemologies in the humanities. Social institutions change as well in such circumstances, and the volume concludes with studies of the new social arrangements that have developed in the humanities in recent years: the attack on professionalism and the effort to transform the humanities into the social conscience of academia and even of the nation as a whole.<br>

  Abstract: Aristotle knew the answer. For him the matter of the division of labor between historiographer and poet was easily decided: the historiographer relates “what has happened,” and the poet “what might happen.”¹ In contrast to Plato’s devastating criticism of literature, Aristotle considered poetry to be of high value. In Aristotle’s eyes, literature dealt with problems of a more general and thus more significant nature, while the historian had to report about specific, and thus,
                  eo ipso,less important matters. Aristotle’s distinctions notwithstanding, one might assume that Calliope and Clio paid scant attention to whether they were called upon by rhapsodists<br>

  Publisher: MQUP<br>
  Author(s): HELLMAN JOHN<br>
  Abstract: In The Knight-Monks of Vichy France John Hellman describes the founding, operation, transformation, and demise of the school, details the institution's ideological and political struggles with other segments of French society, and deals with the remarkable rise of Uriage ideas and alumni in postwar France. By focusing on the social, philosophical, and psychological concepts propounded by the staff of the school, Hellman has produced the first study that shows the École Nationale des Cadres d'Uriage to have been an original educational and group experience which inspired French youth from very different backgrounds to abandon the liberal democratic tradition for a new political and social vision. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews, newly available archival material, Vichy publications, correspondence, and diary entries, Hellman contributes to the current, lively debate concerning the phenomenon of collaboration and the response of the French population to fascism and to the occupation during the Second World War. This book will be of particular interest to readers concerned with the intellectual and political life of modern France, modern religious thought and experience, fascism and the Vichy regime, changes in France in the prewar and postwar periods, and the "third way" political option in contemporary Europe.<br>

  Abstract: That higher life forms exist in the two physical categories of female and male is universally self-evident and is not of itself a problem. Beyond this basic understanding, however, the two sexes become associated with a vast panorama of cultural phenomena, including categorical ascriptions of social roles, behavioural expectations, and personality characteristics. How does the simple, incontrovertible, and universal fact of biological dimorphism generate the staggering complexity of cultural, social, and psychological dynamics of the human condition?

  Abstract: Relatively neglected by critics in comparison to others of his works, Kleist’s story with the elaborate tripartite title, which can be approximately translated into English as “Saint Cecilia, or the Power of Music (A Legend),” has begun to attract increasing attention. To some extent, this is due to the fact that the other works have been examined and reexamined with such exhausting intensity that a turn to lesser-known texts is inevitable. But it is also the case that, among Kleist’s puzzling prose, this story stands out for its strangeness. What is it about? What is its “message”? In this case,<br>

  Abstract: The particular period in which the four writers of this study were contemporaries offered a unique opportunity for the employment and expression of their theological gifts. To look to their particular contribution is to look to the specific tasks that the moment set before them. Born within a decade that saw the burgeoning of progressive currents in Catholic theology, they witnessed both the suspicion and suppression of these themes in the last reaches of the Modernist crisis and their acceptance and legitimation at the Second Vatican Council. At the peak of production in the postconciliar period, each labored for the<br>

  Abstract: What happens when seven scholars sit down face-to-face and commit to do theology collaboratively with their differences on the table? Are their differences minimized? Championed? Moreover, what is their method for such a task? Do they end up following old systems of constructing theology? Or do they forge a new methodological path? These are the questions I will take up in this book. Specifically, this work is a critical investigation of
                  God’s Fierce Whimsy—a challenging and innovative text written and published in the 1980s by a group of seven women who identified themselves as the Mud Flower Collective.¹ This<br>

  Author(s) Teman Elly<br>
  Abstract: Surrogate motherhood,¹ a practice in which a woman agrees to carry a child to term for a couple who will then keep the child as their own, has emerged from the academic literature as an extreme case study for feminist, ethical, legal, and social concerns. With respect to matters of ethics, scholars have asked if there is not something intrinsically immoral about surrogacy (Brennan and Noggle 1997), and some have denounced the practice as depersonalizing or even dehumanizing of women’s reproductive labor and mutating it into a form of alienation (van Niekerk and van Zyl 1995).

  Author(s) Remennick Larissa<br>
  Abstract: Some recent sociological analyses of reproduction approached the relations between women as mothers and various social institutions (legal and medical systems, labor market, social welfare, mass media, etc.) within the continuum between reproductive citizenship, on one hand, and individualism/consumerism, on the other. Thus, Bryan Turner (2001) has defined the concept of reproductive citizenship as a route to active social participation through reproduction, all the more important in the times of general erosion of other traditional forms of citizenship (such as worker-citizen and warrior-citizen). Reproductive citizenship is a reflection of nationalism and demographic interests of the state, which has a stake<br>

  Book Title: Dark Traces of the Past-Psychoanalysis and Historical Thinking<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Rüsen Jörn<br>
  Abstract: The relationship between historical studies and psychoanalysis remains an open debate that is full of tension, in both a positive and a negative sense. In particular, the following question has not been answered satisfactorily: what distinguishes a psychoanalytically oriented study of historical realities from a historical psychoanalysis? Skepticism and fear of collaboration dominate on both sides. Initiating a productive dialogue between historical studies and psychoanalysis seems to be plagued by ignorance and, at times, a sense of helplessness. Interdisciplinary collaborations are rare. Empirical research, formulation of theory, and the development of methods are essentially carried out within the conventional disciplinary boundaries. This volume undertakes to overcome these limitations by combining psychoanalytical and historical perspectives and thus exploring the underlying "unconscious" dimensions and by informing academic and nonacademic forms of historical memory. Moreover, it puts special emphasis on transgenerational forms of remembrance, on the notion of trauma as a key concept in this field, and on case studies that point the way to further research.<br>

The material presence of these houses, along with the effects they have had on the other residents of the town of Kumanovo, could be viewed as part of the “Baroque mechanism” (Lambert 2004).

Clearly, there are as many ways of experiencing history as there are histories to experience’.¹ Such an experience and understanding of history, however, was never a part of my growing up; history books meant an immersion in drudgery, a laborious saunter down a thick slush of facts and a wrestle with the imminent prospect of comeuppance in the event of forgetting some details while writing tests.

  Abstract: Few episodes in the postwar history of Czechoslovakia have received greater attention than the Prague Spring, when reformers in the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KSČ) attempted to create a democratic socialism in the heart of the Soviet bloc, creating unprecedented opportunities for political liberalization, social mobilization, and internationalism in a Stalinist regime that had previously been one of the most conservative in Eastern Europe. The subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops contributed to the commemoration of the Prague Spring as a national rebellion against Soviet hegemony, a myth that Czech and Slovak historians have been laboring to confront since<br>

  Publisher: Leuven University Press<br>
  Author(s): Vervenne Marc<br>
  Abstract: Advanced reader on the history of education Developments in educational systems worldwide have largely contributed to the modernization and globalization of present-day society. However, in order to fully understand their impact, educational systems must be interpreted against a background of particular situations and contexts. This textbook brings together more than twenty (collaborative) contributions focusing on the two key themes in the work of Marc Depaepe: educationalization and appropriation. Compiled for his international master classes, these selected writings provide not only a thorough introduction to the history of modern educational systems, but also a twenty-five year overview of the work of a well-known pioneer in the field of history of education. Covering the modernization of schooling in Western history, the characteristics and origins of educationalization, the colonial experience in education and the process of appropriation, Between Educationalization and Appropriation will be of great interest to a larger audience of scholars in the social sciences.<br>

  Abstract: Synthetic biology is the attempt to “engineer complex artificial biological systems to investigate natural biological phenomena and for a variety of applications” (Andrianantoandro et al. 2006; see also Endy 2005). We will use the expression “synthetic life-forms” to refer to the different kinds of synthetic organisms produced in synthetic biology laboratories. These organisms today are typically various kinds of genetically modified bacteria. Even if most (or even all) of the material in a synthetic life-form comes from natural forms of life, we still consider it to be “synthetic” because it is produced through the intentional activity of laboratory scientists.

In this third chapter, I consider how the literary space of poetry harnesses the possibility of becoming a subject, formed and conceptualized in alternative<br>

  Book Title: Negotiating Justice-Progressive Lawyering, Low-Income Clients, and the Quest for Social Change<br>
  Publisher: NYU Press<br>
  Author(s): Shdaimah Corey S.<br>
  Abstract: While many young people become lawyers for the big bucks, others are motivated by the pursuit of social justice, seeking to help people for whom legal services are financially, socially, or politically inaccessible. These progressive lawyers often bring a considerable degree of idealism to their work, and many leave the field due to insurmountable red tape and spiraling disillusionment. But what about those who stay? And what do their clients think? Negotiating Justice explores how progressive lawyers and their clients negotiate the dissonance between personal idealism and the realities of a system that doesn't often champion the rights of the poor.Corey S. Shdaimah draws on over fifty interviews with urban legal service lawyers and their clients to provide readers with a compelling behind-the-scenes look at how different notions of practice can present significant barriers for both clients and lawyers working with limited resources, often within a legal system that many view as fundamentally unequal or hostile. Through consideration of the central themes of progressive lawyering - autonomy, collaboration, transformation, and social change - Shdaimah presents a subtle and complex tableau of the concessions both lawyers and clients often have to make as they navigate the murky and resistant terrains of the legal system and their wider pursuits of justice and power.<br>

  Abstract: The previous chapter focused on the value of client autonomy. This chapter examines a technique of lawyering that has been called “collaborative lawyering,” which is in many ways closely tied to notions of autonomy. Collaborative lawyering models portray lawyers and clients as “co-eminent problem solvers.”¹ This term is rooted in a belief that both lawyers and clients can and should contribute knowledge and skills to the relationship, and that clients should make decisions and take actions. In this chapter, I briefly examine the basis for collaborative lawyering and advocate adoption of a broad definition of collaboration. Relying on that definition,<br>

  Abstract: In a unique two-pronged dovetailing discussion, frequent collaborators and coauthors Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler discuss the nature of contemporary capitalism.

Offering a historically rich and analytically incisive critique of the recent history of capitalism and crisis, they suggest that instead of studying the relations of capital to power we must conceptualize capital

And indeed, a collective turn to memory – variously referred to as an industry, a boom, an avalanche, and a crisis – undeniably began to materialize in both Western culture and critical discourse in the late 1990s.¹ As elaborated by Andreas Huyssen, this turn can be mapped along three trajectories: the rejection of modernity’s blind trust in progress and development, the articulation of anxiety around<br>

  Book Title: Kathleen Jamie-Essays and Poems on Her work<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Falconer Rachel<br>
  Abstract: Kathleen Jamie's works are classics. No one can read Kathleen Jamie and remain indifferent or unchanged. Nationally acclaimed since her first major publications in the 1980s, Jamie stands out from other contemporary poets in her exceptional musicality, her strikingly unusual perspectives, her wry humour, translucent imagery, and hard-edged economy of expression. These 16 newly commissioned critical essays and 7 previously unpublished poems by leading poets make up the first full-length study of Kathleen Jamie's writing. The essays discuss all of her poetry collections, including The Queen of Sheba (1994), Jizzen (1999), Mr and Mrs Scotland Are Dead: Poems 1980-94 (2002), The Tree House (2004) and The Overhaul (2012), as well as her travel writing, including Among Muslims (2002), her nature writing, Findings (2005) and Sightlines (2012) and her collaborative work, including Frissure (2013), with artist Brigid Collins. Whether engaging with national politics, with gender, with landscape and place, or with humanity's relation to the natural environment, this volume demonstrates that Kathleen Jamie's verse teaches us new ways of listening, of seeing and of living in the contemporary world.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1bgzddd">The Edinburgh Companion to the Critical Medical Humanities</a><br>
  Author(s) Atkinson Sarah<br>
  Abstract: Care as a concept is central to any engagement with health, ill-health and the practices that aim to prevent, mitigate or cure, and the term itself is mobilised in a variety of different ways and at a variety of different scales. The vibrancy of the medical humanities as a relatively new field of inquiry has principally derived from the elaboration of experiential accounts of differential and dynamic conditions of health. Given this particular emphasis, attention to care and caring practices has predominantly concerned the nuanced and complex relations of care at an interpersonal and proximate scale. However, in contemporary landscapes<br>

  Abstract: This second of two chapters on neurological transformations of the human will focus on epigenesis, a particularly fruitful notion for the elaboration of a non-reductive materialist account of the self. At the end of the previous chapter I drew a distinction between the mind–brain problem and the self–brain problem; in the present chapter I will take up that distinction in order to pursue the question of the identity of self (rather than the mind or brain) over time. In the previous chapter I considered how Malabou can overcome the tethering of the question of humanity as such to<br>

  Abstract: In the universal humanism of Michel Serres we saw both a development and a change of direction from the accounts of the human elaborated by Badiou, Meillassoux and Malabou. Whereas the figure to emerge in the thought of Badiou and Meillassoux relies on the host capacity of thought, Malabou moves away from determinate capacities but, in her early work at least, seems to favour a host cerebral substance of human personhood. Serres’s account of the human, by contrast, is multi-modal: he combines de-differentiation with a recognition of determinate capacities, and also develops a narrative account of humanity as part of<br>

  Author(s) McLoughlin Daniel<br>
  Abstract: In an essay entitled ‘In this Exile’, Giorgio Agamben tells a story about his studies with Martin Heidegger, whose seminars he attended in Provence in 1966 and 1968. At some stage, Agamben asked his teacher whether he had read any Kafka, to which Heidegger replied that ‘The Burrow’ was the tale that had made the biggest impression upon him. ‘The Burrow’ is a short story about a creature that devotes their life to constructing an elaborate and impenetrable underground home. And yet despite, or perhaps because of, this zealous attention to security, the creature is haunted by the fantasy that<br>

Challenging the idea that there ever was a ‘French Poststructuralism’ residing somewhere (in Paris, perhaps), like an essence, prior to its construction and (performative) elaboration in the texts and contexts that came subsequently to be regarded as those of ‘French Poststructuralism’, he then goes on to show how the work of figures like Derrida, Barthes, Foucault, Lacan, Deleuze and others gets performatively elaborated in British Cultural Studies, Comparative Literature in the US, or in broader, more geographically<br>

  Author(s) McBride William L.<br>
  Abstract: The word ‘existentialism’ became widely used to identify a major movement of twentieth-century thought during the mid-1940s, immediately following the end of World War II. It had, it is true, already been employed by some philosophers: Gabriel Marcel, a committed Christian thinker, had made use of the language of existentialism in the 1920s; the Italian Nicola Abbagnano had elaborated a version of it in his
                  La struttura dell’esistenza(1939); and in the form ofExistenzphilosophie, for which ‘existential philosophy’ was regarded by many as the most suitable English translation, it had been appropriated by both Martin Heidegger and Karl Jaspers.<br>

  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r1z12">The Edinburgh Companion to Shakespeare and the Arts</a><br>
  Author(s) Buchanan Judith<br>
  Abstract: The idea of silent Shakespeare strikes many as oxymoronic. In its muting of Shakespearean drama, silent Shakespearean cinema robs its inherited source of that which most frequently, and perhaps most crucially, has been taken to define it. In effect, the collaboration of this dramatic material with this medium of expression can be read as a liaison of naturally antithetical forces: one imaginatively evokes the image through the suggestive power of the poetically employed word, the other does not just erode the power of the word in its privileging of the image, but all but ousts words from its performance space.<br>

Specifically, we have seen that Merleau-Ponty’s ontology, whether elaborated in terms of perception or language, is interrogative and indirect, and as such does not fully fall under the Derridean umbrella of ‘le plein de présence immédiate requis par toute ontologie ou par toute métaphysique.’¹ Meaning is not given in<br>

  Abstract: Is it possible to answer the question of politics in the work of Deleuze, without going through desire and its variants? Deleuze’s work spans twenty-six publications, authored by him or written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Félix Guattari. In these texts, Deleuze deals with the thought of Kant, Nietzsche, Bergson, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Foucault, with the writings of Kafka, Proust, Sacher-Masoch, with Francis Bacon’s painting, and with cinema and theatre. Politics, however, because only traces and indices of it exist in his texts, seems to be permanently put to question. At first sight, it is not even clear that there<br>

  Book Title: Post-Foundational Political Thought-Political Difference in Nancy, Lefort, Badiou and Laclau<br>
  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Marchart Oliver<br>
  Abstract: A wide-ranging overview of the emergence of post-foundationalism and a survey of the work of its key contemporary exponents.This book presents the first systematic coverage of the conceptual difference between ‘politics’ (the practice of conventional politics: the political system or political forms of action) and ‘the political’ (a much more radical aspect which cannot be restricted to the realms of institutional politics). It is also the first introductory overview of post-foundationalism and the tradition of ‘left Heideggerianism’: the political thought of contemporary theorists who make frequent use of the idea of political difference: Jean-Luc Nancy, Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou and Ernesto Laclau.After an overview of current trends in social post-foundationalism and a genealogical chapter on the historical emergence of the difference between the concepts of ‘politics’ and ‘the political’, the work of individual theorists is presented and discussed at length. Individual chapters are presented on the political thought of Jean-Luc Nancy (including Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe), Claude Lefort, Alain Badiou, and Ernesto Laclau (including Chantal Mouffe).Overall the book offers an elaboration of the idea of a post-foundational conception of politics.Other titles in the Taking on the Political series: Valentine and Arditi/ Polemicisation 0 7486 1064 2Shapiro/ Cinematic Political Thought 0 7486 1289 0Chambers/ Language and the Politics of Untimeliness 0 7486 1766 3Bowman/ Post-Marxism Versus Cultural Studies 978 0 7486 1762 3Simons/ Critical Political Theory in the Media Age 0 7486 1583 0<br>

The Centre, founded by Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy, turned out to be the location for the most intense and influential re-elaboration so far of the notion of the political, or of the difference between politics and the political.

  Abstract: ‘My purpose here is to encourage and to contribute to a revival of political philosophy.’ These words stand at the beginning of one of Claude Lefort’s most prominent articles (Lefort 1988: 9) – based on a talk he delivered at Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe’s Centre for Philosophical Research on the Political. And indeed, there can be no doubt as to the significance of Lefort’s work for contemporary political philosophy and, in particular, for democracy theory. What Lefort has elaborated is one of the most powerful theorizations of the political, of democracy and totalitarianism, which can help us better to grasp the primacy<br>

  Publisher: Edinburgh University Press<br>
  Author(s): Tynan Aidan<br>
  Abstract: The first study of Deleuze's critical and clinical projectAidan Tynan addresses Deleuze's assertion that 'literature is an enterprise of health' and shows how a concern of health and illness was a characteristic of his philosophy as a whole, from his earliest works to his groundbreaking collaborations with Guattari, to his final, enigmatic statements on 'life'.He explains why alcoholism, anorexia, manic depression and schizophrenia are key concepts in Deleuze's literary theory, and shows how, with the turn to schizoanalysis, literature takes on a crucial political and ethical role in helping us to diagnose our present pathologies and articulate the possibilities of a health to come.Key FeaturesThe first book length study of Deleuze's critical and clinical project and the conceptualisations of health and illness he developed over the course of his careerUses the idea of the literary clinic to unify Deleuze's literary theory with the political critique he developed with Guattari, and argues in this way for a distinctively Deleuzian critical practiceDraws on Deleuze conceptualisations of health and illness to reassess his relationship to key thinkers such as Spinoza, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Melanie Klein and literary figures such as Melville F.

  Abstract: Leading international scholars explore the party's significance to ModernismHave you ever been struck by the number of parties in Modernist literature? Mrs. Ramsay drowns in anguish at the dinner-party she gives in Woolf's To The Lighthouse. Death is a guest in Katherine Mansfield's 'The Garden Party'. Politics sour the evening party in Joyce's 'The Dead'. Have you also noticed the role played by parties in the public intellectual culture of Modernism? A party held in London by Amy Lowell on 17 July 1914, attended by Ezra Pound, Ford Madox Ford, H.D. and Richard Aldington, degenerated into an argument over the nature of Imagism. On 18 May 1922, Proust, Joyce, Picasso, Stravinsky and Diaghilev met at a post-ballet party at Paris's Hotel Majestic: an unrepeatable encounter between Modernism's leading figures. In The Modernist Party, internationally distinguished scholars explore the party both as a literary device and as a social setting in which the movement's creative values were developed.Key Features:* Develops the concept of space, currently of central concern to Modernist scholars* Explores the tensions between Modernism as an aesthetics of intensity and Modernism as a movement of the everyday* Adds a new and vital area of research to investigations of Modernism as the product of intellectual and social networksKeywords: Modernism, Literature, Party, Social Network, Collaboration, Space<br>

  Abstract: How can performance, in itself, be a utopian gesture? Why do people come together to watch other people labor on stage, when contemporary culture solicits their attention with myriad other forms of representation and opportunities for social gathering? Why do people continue to seek the liveness, the present-tenseness that performance and theater offer? Is the desire to be there, in the moment, the expression of a utopian impulse? Certainly, people are drawn to theater and performance by fashion and by taste, by the need to collect the cultural capital that theatergoing provides.

He accomplished this by using a formula he had found in an eighteenth-century mathematics text.² Two years later, three other theorists—Yoichiro Nambu, Leonard Susskind, and Holger Nielsen—independently suggested that Veneziano’s redeployment of this antique mathematical function implied that the particles that formed the nuclei of atoms were not actually zero-dimensional point-particles, but<br>

  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): RABINOWITZ PAULA<br>
  Abstract: The second in a four-part series charting the social, cultural, and political expression of clothing, dress, and accessories,
         Exchanging Clothesfocuses on the concept of transnational "circulation and exchange"-not only the global exchange of material commodities across time and space but also of the ideas, images, colors, and textures related to fashion. Essays examine the parade of heroes past, from Homer and Virgil to Dante and Ariosto, wearing armor or nothing; the social power of a tie or of a safety pin sprung from punk fashion to the red carpet; a Midwestern thrift store, from cheap labor to cheap purchase, as a microcosm of global circulation; and lesbian pulp fiction as how-to-dress manuals.<br>

  Book Title: Making Things and Drawing Boundaries-Experiments in the Digital Humanities<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Sayers Jentery<br>
  Abstract: In
         Making Things and Drawing Boundaries, critical theory and cultural practice meet creativity, collaboration, and experimentation with physical materials as never before. Foregrounding the interdisciplinary character of experimental methods and hands-on research, this collection asks what it means to "make" things in the humanities. How is humanities research manifested in hand and on screen alongside the essay and monograph? And, importantly, how does experimentation with physical materials correspond with social justice and responsibility? Comprising almost forty chapters from ninety practitioners across twenty disciplines,Making Things and Drawing Boundariesspeaks directly and extensively to how humanities research engages a growing interest in "maker" culture, however "making" may be defined.<br>

  Author(s) TURKEL WILLIAM J.<br>
  Abstract: In this chapter we describe three experiences of collaboratively reverse engineering historical electronic artifacts at the University of Western Ontario’s Lab for Humanistic Fabrication, a setting that supports hands-on fabrication and experimentation, programming and computer-aided design, and traditional historical research. Our first case study comes from Elliott’s work on the re-creation of wireless effects designed by early-twentieth-century magicians to simulate mind reading. These effects depended on electromagnetic induction, a technique that has recently come to prominence for its applications in radio-frequency ID tagging, wireless charging, and near-field and secure wireless communications, largely driven by interest in the Internet of Things.<br>

  Abstract: Glitch Console is a hacked or “circuit-bent” Nintendo Entertainment System that links the consumer culture of video game platforms to issues of labor, exploitation, and the environment. Player experience is interrupted by various types of glitches, which dramatically affect and “haunt” game play without crashing the system itself. Circuit bending, or the practice of serendipitously modifying the behavior of electronics by soldering new connection points on a circuit board, also encourages a creative, hands-on approach to media theory and platform studies. For both the player and the artist/hacker, the Glitch Console directs attention to materials and operations.<br>

Our research has started to reveal important connections between the work being done within these spaces and larger developments in corporate technology cultures. Members have reframed a concern for women’s access to technical industries as one of recognizing technical work already there, destabilizing the unmarked categories of technical labor.

                  Reichtum) “appears” as a prodigious heap of commodities, “eine ‘ungeheure Warensammlung.’”¹ Marx beginsCapitalby reminding his readers of the historical distinctiveness of such a society, in which the existential richness of life comes to be measured in the profuse variety of goods available for purchase.

That new paradigm should be evolutionary theory to help correct the mistaken belief “that there is no fixed human nature,” a belief that, according to Singer, continues to shape the left’s knee-jerk rejection of Darwinism.¹ Many on the left, Singer claimed, profoundly misunderstand Darwinian theory: they identify it exclusively with the ruthless “struggle for existence” and “the survival of the fittest” elaborated by Herbert Spencer in the late nineteenth century, which led to the rise of twentieth-century totalitarianism and its racist politics of “social<br>

  Abstract: The erection of monuments and memorials—along with the choreographed ceremonies of commemoration centered on them and the orchestration of public participation around them—transforms particular places into ideologically charged sites of collective memory. Monuments and memorials are powerful mnemonic devices through which the custodians of collective memory seek to encode particular histories and geographies into landscapes of power and resistance. They provide rallying points for shared memories and common identities. They are material signifiers of ideas, transmitters of sentiments, and repositories of ideologies that their permanent affixture to public space intends to immortalize.

  Abstract: What should we remember of the wars of the twentieth century? How can the memory of the millions upon millions of lives sacrificed on all fronts, of the countless victims of organized famine, forced labor, deportation, and the extermination camps be inscribed in our thought? And what form should that memory assume? What is thought’s responsibility in opening itself to that memory? In all probability no great philosophy of the second half of the twentieth century has evaded these questions, no matter how implicitly or allusively they may have been treated.

  Abstract: Featuring established and emerging scholars from varying disciplines, this volume presents a collaborative imagining of what a more-than-green ecology offers. While highlighting critical approaches not yet common within ecotheory, the contributions remain diverse and cover a range of topics including materiality, the inhuman, and the agency of objects. By way of color, Cohen guides readers through a reflection of an essentially complex and disordered universe and demonstrates the spectrum as an unfinishable totality, always in excess of what a human perceives.<br>

  Abstract: While outlining a philosophy of “fine art,” Hegel offered some advice to the nascent discipline of art history. It could be summed up, more or less, as “stick to the facts.” Of course philosophy would forge the aesthetic-theoretical hardwiring of the field. If there had been a sufficient number of art historians at that time to constitute a discipline, this intellectual division of labor might have been understood as a grievous insult. The subsequent formation of the discipline shows that many art historians have indeed treated this as exemplary advice, and thus an extensive arm of art history has concerned<br>

This involves an elaborate discursive ensemble that includes urban myths and legends about negotiation of the public sphere, and the various practices of gift exchange by which people attempt to coalesce the scale of kinship and social ties with that of the bureaucratic state apparatus.

  Book Title: Labor of Dionysus-A Critique of the State-Form<br>
  Publisher: University of Minnesota Press<br>
  Author(s): Negri Antonio<br>
  Abstract: “Labor is the living, form-giving fire,” Marx wrote. “It is the transitoriness of things, their temporality, as their transformation by living time.” How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society? The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.<br>

The fundamental thesis is that these institutional changes, produced by underlying political changes, do not alter the class nature of the bourgeois State, but rather perfect it, making it adequate to the new needs<br>

The 1980s seemed in many respects one long celebration of the definitive victory of capital over labor, from the neoliberal economic revolutions of Reagan and Thatcher in the early eighties to the “death of communism” dramatized by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

  Abstract: I have hitherto described textual structures and the artistic communication system, among others, essentially as sets of material data and networks that constitute the preconditions for the formation of “primary” messages, that is, for the mental elaboration of relatively autonomous possible worlds. Such worlds could be considered mutually interchangeable in the eyes of an ideal, abstract “subject,” since they were approached on the basis of their production rules, not from the viewpoint of their desirability. Similarly, a nation’s industrial equipment and infrastructure can be described as able to produce heavy machinery and high tech means of transportation, without taking into<br>

  Abstract: DURING 1987 the Australian press reported frequently that Aboriginal art, especially Western Desert¹ acrylic “dot paintings,” had become flavor of the month in New York, Paris, and Munich. “Flavor of the month” is an odd descriptor Australians overuse to resolve the incompatibility of such reports of Australian success overseas with a cherished and characteristic myth of the second-rate, sometimes labeled “cultural cringe.” Indeed, Australia now has a suspiciously elaborate terminology for identifying the contradictions of colonialism and creativity.

The human beings who despoil the natural world are not motivated by greed, nor are they mindless consumers of material possessions.

  Book Title: The Habermas Handbook-  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): LAFONT CRISTINA<br>
  Abstract: Jürgen Habermas is one of the most influential philosophers of our time. His diagnoses of contemporary society and concepts such as the public sphere, communicative rationality, and cosmopolitanism have influenced virtually all academic disciplines, spurred political debates, and shaped intellectual life in Germany and beyond for more than fifty years. In
      The
            Habermas Handbook, leading Habermas scholars elucidate his thought, providing essential insight into his key concepts, the breadth of his work, and his influence across politics, law, the social sciences, and public life.This volume offers a comprehensive overview and an in-depth analysis of Habermas's work in its entirety. After examining his intellectual biography, it goes on to illuminate the social and intellectual context of Habermasian thought, such as the Frankfurt School, speech-act theory, and contending theories of democracy. TheHandbookprovides an extensive account of Habermas's texts, ranging from his dissertation on Schelling to his most recent writing about Europe. It illustrates the development of his thought and its frequently controversial reception while elaborating the central ideas of his work. The book also provides a glossary of key terms and concepts, making the complexity of Habermas's thought accessible to a broad readership.<br>

  Abstract: From the beginning, Jürgen Habermas has elaborated his theory of discursive ethics by engaging with Hegel’s critique of Kant. He shares both these philosophers’ view that morality, under the conditions of modernity, can no longer be understood—as had been the case for Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas—by way of all-encompassing prescriptions concerning the “good” or “happy” life (

  Abstract: Habermas’s legal theory must be understood as part of a much larger project that combines theoretical and practical philosophy in an uncommonly thorough way for the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Habermas (in
                  Truth) has lamented the fact that, in a landscape increasingly distinguished by the division of academic labor, the two perspectives have grown more and more separate (for an expressly different view, see Rawls 2005, 372ff.). At the same time, his writings have proved that this need not be the case. Habermas was interested in matters of political theory from the first, even if he came to address them<br>

  Author(s) KOLLER ANDREAS<br>
  Abstract: The notion of unavoidable, idealizing presuppositions of a pragmatic nature that Habermas elaborates in his later works represents an effort to nuance—and, ultimately, to replace—the confusing concept of an “ideal speech situation” that he presented in the works of his middle period. Since
                     Between Facts and Norms, Habermas has understood “counterfactual presuppositions”—or, alternatively, the “vocabulary of the as-if”—as “the nerve of my entire theoretical undertaking” (1998, 418). The social sciences in particular have paid little attention to this conceptual move, however. Accordingly, the matter represents one of the most misunderstood elements of Habermasian theory.<br>

  Abstract: The theory of historical materialism developed by Marx and Engels understands social conditions as the result of a teleological historical process.

  Book Title: Neopoetics-The Evolution of the Literate Imagination<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): Collins Christopher<br>
  Abstract: The quest to understand the evolution of the literary mind has become a fertile field of inquiry and speculation for scholars across literary studies and cognitive science. In
      Paleopoetics, Christopher Collins's acclaimed earlier title, he described how language emerged both as a communicative tool and as a means of fashioning other communicative tools-stories, songs, and rituals. InNeopoetics, Collins turns his attention to the cognitive evolution of the writing-ready brain. Further integrating neuroscience into the popular field of cognitive poetics, he adds empirical depth to our study of literary texts and verbal imagination and offers a whole new way to look at reading, writing, and creative expression. Collins beginsNeopoeticswith the early use of visual signs, first as reminders of narrative episodes and then as conventional symbols representing actual speech sounds. Next he examines the implications of written texts for the play of the auditory and visual imagination. To exemplify this long transition from oral to literate artistry, Collins examines a wide array of classical texts-from Homer and Hesiod to Plato and Aristotle and from the lyric innovations of Augustan Rome to the inner dialogues of St. Augustine. In this work of "big history," Collins demonstrates how biological and cultural evolution collaborated to shape both literature and the brain we use to read it.<br>

  Author(s) Harrison Anna<br>
  Abstract: Bathed in the bliss of eternity, the dead commune with the living. So Bernard proclaims in his five 
                  Sermons for the Feast of All Saints.¹ For Bernard, commonality of experience establishes a sense of community between the happy dead and those who labor on pilgrimage. Our common experience of suffering and of sinfulness fuels our confidence in the saints and engenders sympathy for us in them. Furthermore, desire for God is common to the living and the dead; desire transports the longing soul to heaven to share—however partially—in the experience of saved souls, which is boundless desire for<br>

  Book Title: Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fiction-Environment and Affect<br>
  Publisher: Columbia University Press<br>
  Author(s): HOUSER HEATHER<br>
  Abstract: Tracing the development of ecosickness through a compelling archive of modern U.S. novels and memoirs, this study demonstrates the mode's crucial role in shaping thematic content and formal and affective literary strategies. Examining works by David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, Leslie Marmon Silko, Marge Piercy, Jan Zita Grover, and David Wojnarowicz, Heather Houser shows how these authors unite experiences of environmental and somatic damage through narrative affects that draw attention to ecological phenomena, organize perception, and convert knowledge into ethics. Traversing contemporary cultural studies, ecocriticism, affect studies, and literature and medicine, Houser juxtaposes ecosickness fiction against new forms of environmentalism and technoscientific innovations such as regenerative medicine and alternative ecosystems.
      Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fictionrecasts recent narrative as a laboratory in which affective and perceptual changes both support and challenge political projects.<br>

  Author(s) Aronson Ronald<br>
  Abstract: Albert Camus, a master of unforgettable images in his fiction and philosophy, left us none more striking than that of Sisyphus. Condemned to forever roll his rock up the hill only to see it roll back down, then to descend and begin again, Sisyphus incarnates a twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century sense of life’s absurdity, its “futility and hopeless labor.”¹ Yet there is something triumphant in his endless effort, his intense consciousness. He is the absurd hero: “His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole<br>

  Abstract: At first sight, Marxism and memory appear as two foreign continents. Since Marx, many scholars belonging to his intellectual tradition have elaborated philosophies of history or investigated historical temporalities—E. P. Thompson’s studies on time and work discipline in early industrial capitalism are the most known—but have never conceptualized collective remembrance. Opened one century ago by Henri Bergson and Maurice Halbwachs, the scholarly debate on memory deeply shaped sociology, historiography, and philosophy without receiving any significant Marxist contribution. The rare assessments made by Marxist scholars on this topic simply reproduce a classical, positivistic dichotomy between history and memory: memory<br>

Let me begin with the most visible phenomena surrounding the renewal of religion, which are also the most vaguely defined. This is what we might call, following the title of a book published in France a few years ago, the triumph of God.

  Abstract: This may seem incredible, but if you work through Heidegger you can easily get to Marx. Heidegger’s forgetting of Being can be likened to Marx’s alienation and Lukács’s reification. In at least two ways: you can’t change anything by yourself, so to sort things out you have to make a revolution; and the forgetting of Being as Heidegger thinks it is what Marxism explains with the division of labor: you yourself don’t enjoy all the fruits of your labor, and a society is erected in which everything is commodified, including you as a worker.<br>

  Abstract: It can be argued that the proper history of the Chinese Buddhist canon begins with its printed editions because the printed format allows for easier access, wider dissemination, standardization of the contents, and preservation of textual stability. But before the earliest printed editions appeared, for a period of more than five hundred years, Chinese scholars zealously labored over the creation of the principles of textual criticism and taxonomic organization, which they applied to the handwritten canon and which eventually affected the contents and structure of the printed version. In the canon catalogs, various manuscripts of translated Buddhist texts, as well<br>

  Book Title: Relaciones Internacionales y Política Exterior de Colombia-  Publisher: Universidad de los Andes<br>
  Author(s): Tickner Arlene B.<br>
  Abstract: El Centro de Estudios Internacionales (CEI), hoy parte activa del Departamento de Ciencia Política de la Universidad de los Andes, se consolidó como pionero en los estudios internacionales en Colombia. Desde allí se exploraron debates cruciales en la teoría de las relaciones internacionales y se produjeron algunas de las conclusiones más importantes sobre análisis de la política exterior colombiana. Algunas de éstas tuvieron que ver con el desarrollo de modelos analíticos y conceptuales para explicar la evolución histórica de la política exterior del país, siendo los más influyen¬tes las ideas del respice polum y respice similia, estrategias diferentes pero no necesariamente exclusivas o contradictorias de inserción en el sistema internacional. También, se elaboraron varias aproximaciones al estudio críti¬co y juicioso de la complejidad de las relaciones con los Estados Unidos, con la región y los países vecinos, y con el resto del mundo. En este contexto se construyeron aproximaciones a temas como el narcotráfico, la integración, los derechos humanos, el medio ambiente, la negociación internacional y la seguridad nacional, regional e internacional. Este libro recopila algunos de los trabajos más representativos que se produjeron en el CEI y el Departa¬mento de Ciencia Política y que hoy hacen parte del acervo académico sobre las relaciones internacionales y la política exterior del país. Aquí se recons¬truye parte importante del estado del debate en esta área y, por supuesto, se sugiere la necesidad de continuar alimentando la discusión.<br>

  Abstract: El propósito central de este trabajo será estudiar las condiciones sociales de la difusión de las letras en Colombia, particularmente en las provincias de la costa Atlántica colombiana, fijando nuestra atención en el proceso de organización de la educación, la formación de las primeras escuelas republicanas, las enseñanzas particulares y la presencia de varios libros de la patria entre 1821-1886. Intentaré, a partir de una lectura menos “prevenida" y “dogmática" del siglo XIX, demostrar como detrás de los lugares comunes y las falsas oposiciones construidas entre el centralismo y el federalismo, los credos políticos liberales o conservadores de los caudillos que empuñaron las armas, de la Iglesia y sus difíciles relaciones con el Estado, existió un grupo de autoridades políticas, maestros, vecinos, ciudadanos, hombres, mujeres y gentes de diversa procedencia social, es decir, habitantes de las ciudades, las parroquias, los cantones o de otros lugares distantes de las capitales provinciales y del extranjero, interesadas por conformar y “reunirse" en pequeñas juntas y asociaciones de instrucción pública, en fundar establecimientos escolares, traer y publicar obras de educación, elaborar estados demostrativos acerca de las poblaciones y las escuelas, entre otras actividades políticas, cívicas y religiosas que fueron dando cuenta de la presencia paulatina de una inicial cultura letrada en las provincias de la costa Atlántica en la República de Colombia.<br>

  Abstract: Escritores e críticos são leitores privilegiados que dedicam boa parte de suas vidas a elaborar e interpretar textos ficcionais. Os primeiros usufruem a liberdade de criação: podem expressar-se sem amarras, produzir textos comprometidos essencialmente com a arte da escrita, optando por explicitar ou não seu projeto ideológico. Bem diferente é a situação do crítico literário, cuja ação se inicia assim que o livro chega às prateleiras (físicas ou virtuais). Pode-se esperar que ele se posicione perante um texto, aquilate sua relevância, comente sua contribuição ao contexto artístico-cultural, reconheça suas qualidades e opine, favorável ou contrariamente à obra, no intuito de<br>

  Book Title: Death and the Classic Maya Kings-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): FITZSIMMONS JAMES L.<br>
  Abstract: Like their regal counterparts in societies around the globe, ancient Maya rulers departed this world with elaborate burial ceremonies and lavish grave goods, which often included ceramics, red pigments, earflares, stingray spines, jades, pearls, obsidian blades, and mosaics. Archaeological investigation of these burials, as well as the decipherment of inscriptions that record Maya rulers' funerary rites, have opened a fascinating window on how the ancient Maya envisaged the ruler's passage from the world of the living to the realm of the ancestors.<br>

  Abstract: These four episodes of apotheosis from the Encounter underscore the roles of religion, material culture, and embodiment in early exchanges between Mesoamericans and Europeans. According to these accounts (all redacted by Europeans), the Aztecs identified Hernán Cortés and his companions as
                  teteo(deities) andteixiptlahuan, their localized embodiments: first, in Francisco López de Gómara’s account, “the Mexicans”—a gathering of Amecamecan locals—associate the Spaniards with gods; second, the Tlaxcalans describe Cortés’s translator Marina/Malintzin as a goddess; third, thetlahtoani(speaker;ruler) Moteuczoma Xocoyotl (Lord Angry, Younger) identifies Cortés with Quetzalcoatl (Quetzal Feather Serpent); and fourth, Chimalpahin’s annotation reiterates and elaborates<br>

  Book Title: Narrative Threads-  Publisher: University of Texas Press<br>
  Author(s): URTON GARY<br>
  Abstract: The Inka Empire stretched over much of the length and breadth of the South American Andes, encompassed elaborately planned cities linked by a complex network of roads and messengers, and created astonishing works of architecture and artistry and a compelling mythology-all without the aid of a graphic writing system. Instead, the Inkas' records consisted of devices made of knotted and dyed strings-called khipu-on which they recorded information pertaining to the organization and history of their empire. Despite more than a century of research on these remarkable devices, the khipu remain largely undeciphered.<br>

  Abstract: Beginning some thirty years ago, my collaborator (an anthropologist) and I (a mathematician) began an extensive investigation of Inka khipu. Our work included firsthand study of over 215 khipu spread throughout thirteen countries, in thirty-four museums and private collections. Recognizing the fragility and importance of the artifacts, we recorded and published detailed descriptions, including knot types and placement, cord and space measurements, and colors, for each khipu we studied (Ascher and Ascher 1978, 1988). We analyzed the khipu as a corpus, as well as analyzing them individually. Building on previous studies of khipu and on our own findings, we came<br>

  Abstract: Pondering the question of “style” in historiographical narration, Hannah Arendt notes: “The question of 
                  style is bound up with the problem of understanding which has plagued the historical sciences almost from their beginnings.”¹ What is the “style” of Arendt’s monumental Origins of Totalitarianism, the text we are primarily concerned with here? And how does its efficacy relate to the problem of understanding totalitarianism? In her response to political philosopher Eric Voegelin, one of the first reviewers of Origins, Arendt elaborates on her decision to, as it were, allocate more historiographical legitimacy to the valences of metaphorical thinking than to statistical<br>

  Book Title: The Light of Knowledge-Literacy Activism and the Politics of Writing in South India<br>
  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Cody Francis<br>
  Abstract: The Light of Knowledgeis set primarily in the rural district of Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, and it is about activism among laboring women from marginalized castes who have been particularly active as learners and volunteers in the movement. In their endeavors to remake the Tamil countryside through literacy activism, workers in the movement found that their own understanding of the politics of writing and Enlightenment was often transformed as they encountered vastly different notions of language and imaginations of social order. Indeed, while activists of the movement successfully mobilized large numbers of rural women, they did so through logics that often pushed against the very Enlightenment rationality they hoped to foster. Offering a rare behind-the-scenes look at an increasingly important area of social and political activism,The Light of Knowledgebrings tools of linguistic anthropology to engage with critical social theories of the postcolonial state.<br>

  Book Title: Paradigms for a Metaphorology-  Publisher: Cornell University Press<br>
  Author(s): Savage Robert<br>
  Abstract: What role do metaphors play in philosophical language? Are they impediments to clear thinking and clear expression, rhetorical flourishes that may well help to make philosophy more accessible to a lay audience, but that ought ideally to be eradicated in the interests of terminological exactness? Or can the images used by philosophers tell us more about the hopes and cares, attitudes and indifferences that regulate an epoch than their carefully elaborated systems of thought?<br>

  Abstract: In the treatise on Alexander Pope he wrote in collaboration with Mendelssohn, Lessing speaks of the philosophical use of what in rhetoric are called ‘figures’, a category that includes metaphor: “And wherein consists the essence of the same?—In their never sticking strictly to the truth; they say now too much, now too little—only a metaphysician of Böhme’s ilk can be forgiven them.”¹<br>

  Abstract: If we attempt now to elaborate and set out a 
                  typology of metaphor histories with the help of paradigms, this does not imply that the thematic goal and ideal of the metaphorology we have in mind would consist in such a typology. In carrying out this task, we should recall that metaphorology—as a subbranch of conceptual history, and like the latter itself considered as a whole—must always be an auxiliary discipline to philosophy as it seeks to understand itself from its history and to bring that history to living presence. Our typology of metaphor histories must accordingly endeavor<br>

  Abstract: Technology was sold to modern societies as a wonderful engine of progress. Allied with science it would liberate people from ignorance and debilitating labor, deepen and extend democratic participation, and make the goods of high culture (music, literature, and so on) universally available. It would do all of that not by social revolution (abolishing property or social class) but by applying the science of nature to the problems of humanity. A few prominent examples from the latter-nineteenth and twentieth centuries lent credibility to the picture, including improved public health; labor-saving devices for housework and agriculture; enhanced access to high culture<br>

  Abstract: For all that Rolland and d’Annunzio took opposite positions in relation to the French Revolution, they both claimed to speak in the name of the “people” or the “nation.” Moreover, they foreshadowed the ultimate expression of the new mass politics, inaugurated by the French Revolution, in the rival revolutionary movements that emerged from the chaos and carnage of the First World War. The Bolsheviks in Russia and the Fascists in Italy both recognized the importance of mobilizing the masses through the elaboration of a civil religion. This “aesthetics of politics,” pioneered in the French Revolution,¹ had a theatrical, performative character,<br>

  Book Title: Studies in Medievalism XXIV-Medievalism on the Margins<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Montoya Alicia C.<br>
  Abstract: This volume not only defines medievalism's margins, as well as its role in marginalizing other fields, ideas, people, places, and events, but also provides tools and models for exploring those issues and indicates new subjects to which they might apply. The eight opening essays address the physical marginalizing of medievalism in annotated texts on medieval studies; the marginalism of oneself via medievalism; medievalism's dearth of ecotheory and religious studies; academia's paucity of pop medievalism; and the marginalization of races, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and literary characters in contemporary medievalism. The seven subsequent articles build on this foundation while discussing: the distancing of oneself (and others) during imaginary visits to the Middle Ages; lessons from the margins of Brazilian medievalism; mutual marginalization among factions of Spanish medieval studies; and medievalism in the marginalization of lower socio-economic classes in late-eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Spain, of modern gamers, of contemporary laborers, and of Alfred Austin, a late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poet also known as Alfred the Little. In thus investigating the margins of and marginalization via medievalism, the volume affirms their centrality to the field.

  Book Title: Cultural Performances in Medieval France-Essays in Honor of Nancy Freeman Regalado<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Burns E. Jane<br>
  Abstract: This collection of essays pays tribute to Nancy Freeman Regalado, a ground-breaking scholar in the field of medieval French literature whose research has always pushed beyond disciplinary boundaries. The articles in the volume reflect the depth and diversity of her scholarship, as well as her collaborations with literary critics, philologists, historians, art historians, musicologists, and vocalists - in France, England, and the United States. Inspired by her most recent work, these twenty-four essays are tied together by a single question, rich in ramifications: how does performance shape our understanding of medieval and pre-modern literature and culture, whether the nature of that performance is visual, linguistic, theatrical, musical, religious, didactic, socio-political, or editorial? The studies presented here invite us to look afresh at the interrelationship of audience, author, text, and artifact, to imagine new ways of conceptualizing the creation, transmission, and reception of medieval literature, music, and art.

  Book Title: Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities-  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Whitehead Chris<br>
  Abstract: Across the global networks of heritage sites, museums, and galleries, the importance of communities to the interpretation and conservation of heritage is increasingly being recognised. Yet the very term "meaningful community engagement" betrays a myriad of contrary approaches and understandings. Who is a community? How can they engage with heritage and why would they want to? How do communities and heritage professionals perceive one another? What does it mean to "engage"? These questions unsettle the very foundations of community engagement and indicate a need to unpick this important but complex trend. Engaging Heritage, Engaging Communities critically explores the latest debates and practices surrounding community collaboration. By examining the different ways in which communities participate in heritage projects, the book questions the benefits, costs and limitations of community engagement. Whether communities are engaging through innovative initiatives or in response to economic, political or social factors, there is a need to understand how such engagements are conceptualised, facilitated and experienced by both the organisations and the communities involved.BR> Bryony Onciul is Lecturer in History at the University of Exeter; Michelle Stefano is the Co-Director of Maryland Traditions, the folklife program for the state of Maryland and Visiting Assistant Professor in American Studies at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County; Stephanie Hawke is a project manager and fundraiser, working on a range of projects aiming to engage communities with cultural heritage.

  Book Title: Secret Police Files from the Eastern Bloc-Between Surveillance and Life Writing<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Petrescu Corina L.<br>
  Abstract: The communist secret police services of Central and Eastern Europe kept detailed records not only of their victims but also of the vast networks of informants and collaborators upon whom their totalitarian systems depended. These records, now open to the public in many former Eastern Bloc countries, reflect a textually mediated reality that has defined and shaped the lives of former victims and informers, creating a tension between official records and personal memories. Exploring this tension between a textually and technically mediated past and the subject/victim's reclaiming and retrospective interpretation of that past in biography is the goal of this volume. While victims' secret police files have often been examined as a type of unauthorized archival life writing, the contributors to this volume are among the first to analyze the fragmentary and sometimes remedial nature of these biographies and to examine the subject/victims' rewriting and remediation of them in various creative forms. Essays focus, variously, on the files of the East German Stasi, the Romanian Securitate (in relation to Transylvanian Germans in Romania), and the Hungarian State Security Agency.

  Abstract: When the Stasi files were opened in 1992, commentators expressed concern that the resulting revelations would turn the Stasi’s former collaborators into the scapegoats of the newly unified Germany.¹ However, suggestions that the archive should be buried or burned to prevent the hounding of former
                  Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter(unofficial collaborators, or IMs) by the press were met with an outcry against the impossibility of doing justice for victims if the files were simply destroyed. Archival access was firmly supported by a collective of poets and authors who had been victims of the Stasi, and who in 1992 together published the volume<br>

  Abstract: If the medieval did not function in the early eighteenth century, as it does in our own time, as a historical or chronological category, then how exactly did it work? I argued in the previous chapter that in actual linguistic usage, the term 
                  moyen âge often served as a literary or linguistic term, as reflected also in the common use of the accompanying adjective barbare to describe the period. In this chapter, elaborating on this notion of the medieval as a non-historical concept, I argue that during the early eighteenth century, the medieval came to embody essentially a moral category<br>

  Book Title: The Faustian Century-German Literature and Culture in the Age of Luther and Faustus<br>
  Publisher: Boydell & Brewer<br>
  Author(s): Weeks Andrew<br>
  Abstract: The Reformation and Renaissance, though segregated into distinct disciplines today, interacted and clashed intimately in Faust, the great figure that attained European prominence in the anonymous 1587 'Historia von D. Johann Fausten'. The original Faust behind Goethe's great drama embodies a remote culture. In his century, Faust evolved from an obscure cipher to a universal symbol. The age explored here as "the Faustian century" invested the 'Faustbuch' and its theme with a symbolic significance still of exceptional relevance today. The new essays in this volume complement one another, providing insights into the tensions and forces that gave the century its distinct character. Several essays seek Faust's prototypes. Others elaborate the symbolic function of his figure and discern the resonance of his tale in conflicting allegiances. This volume focuses on the intersection of historical accounts and literary imaginings, on shared aspects of the work and its times, on concerns with obedience and transgression, obsessions with the devil and curiosity about magic, and quandaries created by shifting religious and worldly authorities.

  Abstract: The worst ʹEgyptian dayʹ suffered by the Jews of twelfth-century England was undoubtedly the massacre at York in 1190 – an event that stunned contemporary onlookers, Jews and Christians alike.² Of contemporary chroniclers who discuss the violence at York, William of Newburgh provides the most elaborated detail. He identifies the Egyptian day of Richardʹs coronation as something new for the Jews: events, he writes, were ʹsuddenly changed against themʹ. Other chroniclers of the persecutions of the Jews that followed the coronation of Richard the Lionheart in 1189 likewise noted that they were novel: Ralph de Diceto, an eyewitness and participant<br>

  Abstract: Roland Barthes’ insistence on the death of the author (1968),¹ closely followed by Michel Foucault’s equally provocative interrogation of the writing subject (‘What is an Author?’ 1969),² have been elaborated, qualified, denigrated and newly historicised in almost half a century’s literary theorisings. Common sense alone suggests that in denying a critical need to relate the individual subject (whether author or reader) to a larger cultural, historically specific field of operations, Barthes’ theory of textual construction went too far. But whatever its implicit contradictions (and current memory studies have identified several), there is no denying that the post-structuralist critique of authorship<br>

  2:  Schmidt’s Concept of Literary Realism from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt81f1w">Arno Schmidt's 'Zettel's Traum'</a><br>
  Abstract: The illusionistic nature of language finds its first elaboration in Schmidt’s concept of literary realism, which dominated his writings in the 1950s. As I showed in the previous chapter, Schmidt’s early writing already shows his awareness of the impossibility of ideal literary representation in Foucault’s sense of the classical age of representation.² Schmidt’s call for a literature emulating the lack of continuity typical of modern existence attests to that awareness,³ as does his criticism of traditional prose forms — the epistolary novel, epic novel, and diary — with their classic sequence of beginning, middle, and end. Schmidt’s conclusion that extant<br>

  Abstract: Over recent decades, the U.S. labor force has been experiencing greater temporal diversity in the nature of employment. The total number of weekly hours people are employed has been spreading to both ends of the continuum, so that more people are working very few as well as very many hours (Smith 1986; U.S. Department of Labor 2002). Which hours people are working has also been changing with flextime on the rise (Golden 2001; U.S. Department of Labor 1998) and more people working the “fringe times”—several hours before or after the traditional nine-to-five workday (Hamermesh 1999).

  Abstract: Recent changes in the U.S. economy and labor force have led to great diversity in the time workers spend on the job. The increased diversity refers not only to changes in the absolute number of working hours, as many workers work more hours per week and many others work fewer hours, but also to which hours and days they are working and how much flexibility they have in determining which hours they work. The so-called “standard shift”—thirty-five to forty hours per week, nine to five, Monday through Friday—has increasingly become the exception rather than the standard, since fewer<br>

  Author(s) Stewart Benjamin<br>
  Abstract: Bicycle messengers provide a valuable on-demand service to urban businesses that require same-day delivery of time-sensitive material. This chapter analyzes the spatial and organizational contradictions that enable and disrupt the urban bicycle messenger industry’s production of speed. It begins with the industry’s general context, describing the congestion that makes the “low-tech” bicycle the city’s fastest mode of delivery. It then moves to explore two sides of the messenger’s labor situation, the stress that arises conjointly out of that enabling congestion and the industry’s demands for speed, and the stress-mitigating enjoyment that arises out of those aspects of the labor similar<br>

  Author(s) Bershady Harold J.<br>
  Abstract: From the 1930s to the mid-1960s, Talcott Parsons was the leading contributor to the development of sociological theory, in the United States and internationally. More than any other contemporary figure, he shaped the conceptual schemes used in research, the bodies of theory taught to students, and thinking about the issues requiring investigation at the frontiers of sociological knowledge. In some dozen books and hundreds of essays, he elaborated an unfolding theoretical system that not only had a far-reaching, formative influence on sociological thought and research but also extended to other social sciences, including economics, political science, anthropology, psychology, and psychoanalysis.<br>

  Abstract: Social scientists have been “worrying about social change,” as Charles Tilly puts it (1983, p.1), since the emergence of the various disciplines in the nineteenth century. The enduring concern to understand the roots and consequences of the industrial revolution has certainly not been misplaced. Yet sociologists, even more than other social scientists, have labored under serious misconceptions. All too often, according to Tilly (1983, p. 6), sociologists have assumed that “ ‘social change’ is a coherent general phenomenon, explicable
                  en bloc.” And they have postulated that the “main processes of large-scale social change take distinct societies through a succession of<br>

  Abstract: In the summer of 1998, I visited the artist Todor Tsonev, who had become famous after 1989 with his exhibition of cartoons of Todor Zhivkov that he had painted during communism, one of the very few cases where the expectation of a “closet full of masterpieces” that were cached away from the forbidding eyes of censorship actually was vindicated. Maria Ovcharova, his close friend and collaborator and a scholar in her own right, had organized this exhibit after 1989, and it triggered enormous interest.

  Abstract: About 60 km from Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia, lies a small town which currently represents the primary case of what can be described as a “museum of Socialism in the country.” The town has nothing that can be compared to Budapest’s Statue Park, nor is it a place where the heritage of the socialist period is put on display, decontextualized and recontextualized in a post-socialist mode. It would be wrong to suggest that the town was once the location of a labor camp or a prison for the socialist regime’s opponents. The town is not, or at least not directly, related<br>

Author(s): Duranti Alessandro<br>
Abstract: Ahearn, always a perceptive writer, brings out a fear that many linguistic anthropologists have but rarely expressthe fear of being assimilated to sociocultural anthropology and thus losing their identity through the forfeiting of their specificity. This is the flip side of William Labovs original wish that sociolinguistics might disappear once linguistics agreed to see language as a social phenomenon (that this has not happened is both an indictment of linguistics narrowmindedness and a validation of Labovs and other sociolinguists efforts to develop sociolinguistics into a vibrant independent field). The question then arises why we should worry about being assimilated. Shouldnt we, on the contrary, welcome such a possibility, to be seen as a validation of our work or as the mainstreaming of our concerns? The problem is not in the future, which cannot be predicted, but in the past. Everything we know from our earlier experiences warns us that an anthropology without a distinct group of language specialists is likely to be an anthropology with a nave understanding of communication. We have seen it happen already. When anthropology departments decide not to have a linguistic subfield, thinking that they dont need one, their students tend to take language for granted, identifying it with a vague notion of discourse. It is for this reason that we need to sharpen our historical, theoretical, and methodological understanding of what it means to study language as culture. We owe it first to our students.<br>

Author(s): Luhmann Niklas <br>
Abstract: Theories are always, in some way, about their theorists. While Luhmann’s variant of mutant functionalism is not palatable to American tastes, his theories are as reflective of late‐20th‐century European sensibilities as Parsons’s were of mid‐20th‐century America or Bellah and Geertz’s of the upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, some art critics have warmed to Luhmann’s book as an exemplar of one of the newer “cool” theories of art; that is, those that challenge more subject‐centered and humanist theories and aim to accommodate the growth of new mediums such as digital art and cyberspace. But in any conception of art that includes culture, the medium is only as good as the meaning it conveys. And it is the meaning of art that is sorely lacking in Luhmann’s appraisal. Paul Ricoeur once wrote that “materialism is the truth of a world without truth.” It might then be said of Luhmann’s conception of the art system that it is the truth of art without meaning.<br>

Author(s): Bourgeois,  Patrick L.<br>
Abstract: Ricoeur gets the relation of critique and reason right, in Bourgeois’s eyes, as a philosopher who sees imagination tied to thinking at the boundary (not limit) of reason. In a chapter examining Derrida’s views on “sign, time, and trace” (chap. 7), Bourgeois elaborates Derrida’s view that Edmund Husserl’s distinction between meaningful expression and sign depends on a stable borderline between primary and secondary memory (or retention and recollection) in his theory of “the living present” (or duration), which, Derrida asserts, is phenomenologically unavailable. In light of this analysis, Bourgeois draws an interesting contrast between Derrida’s insistence on a discrete closure of meaning and Ricoeur’s theory of language and imagination based in a view of the living present of meaning and experience that refuses such discrete closure. Once more, however, Bourgeois overreaches when he attempts to identify these accurately drawn contrasts with the limit/boundary distinction. In Bourgeois’s reading of Ricoeur, imagination does not produce reason from below (as in Heidegger); rather, “reason itself limits knowledge to experience from above, putting the imagination in a central position both in knowledge and thinking” (p. 131). A productive imagination of living metaphor takes place at the boundary of reason, allowing the living present in meaning and action to escape deconstruction’s critique while still incorporating a positive relation to alterity. Nevertheless, Bourgeois may be drawing the wrong conclusion about these contrasts, for it seems possible to read both Ricoeur and Derrida as seeking to work at the boundary (not limit) of reason and to think somehow the presentation of the Idea in the Kantian sense. Whereas Ricoeur’s theory of metaphor and narrative allows him to present the semantic content of the Ideas of Reason positively, these remain for Derrida (as for Kant) unrepresentable, or “the impossible.” This problem has been Derrida’s enduring concern since his 1962
   Introduction to Husserl’s “The Origin of Geometry.”The real difference between the thought of Ricoeur and Derrida is the distinctive way each thinker supplements phenomenology to take into account the creativity of meaning at the boundary of reason. For Derrida, it is thedifféranceof deconstruction; for Ricoeur, the graft of hermeneutics.<br>

Serene Jones has drawn attention to the fact that the poststructuralist theoretical assumptions about the always oppressive nature of binarisms do not necessarily hold up under the pressures of concrete political struggles and that, in order to strengthen the bond of solidarity for a coalition of diverse social and cultural identities, what is called for is some kind of grand narrative that clearly defines the powers to be resisted and dismantled. I think this applies to a coalition of different religious identities as well.

Abstract: Nevertheless, empiricism does not have the last word—it perhaps never has the last word, not even in what might be called “positivist empiricism,” and certainly not in practical theology, as this discipline is characterized by the interaction between empiricism and normativeness. We both share this conviction—the fifth characteristic. Therefore human rights—no matter how contested they are, which is neither surprising nor extraordinary—offer an important perspective, as the normative criteria they embody always require critical and constructive reflection. In the last part of the article I have even presented them as regulative principles of truth and justice, as a result of which they offer a kind of worldview‐related and morality‐related infrastructure for the social institutions that determine human actions in societal and personal life—the sixth characteristic. After all, for both Browning and me the ultimate issue is—the seventh characteristic—the vitality of the Christian tradition in terms of relevance and identity in the context of a multicivilization society.<br>

Author(s): Kern Stephen <br>
Abstract: Kern’s analysis is lucid and his thesis is ultimately persuasive. He argues that “the novel is emphatically historical in capturing a new sense of the complexity and uncertainty of causal understanding” as he traces the “sensitivity” of contemporary authors like Don DeLillo to “the significance of the new technologies of transportation, communication and investigation that transformed causal understanding in modern society” (p. 369). This is an observation with which many literary critics would agree. There are resemblances here to the methodology deployed by Ronald Thomas in his seminal and startlingly successful work
   Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science(Cambridge, 1999): narrative registers in its very construction the pressures of scientific and epistemological change. Yet a comparison with Thomas’s work reveals perhaps one of the few flaws of Kern’s study. IfA Cultural History of Causalityis directed toward the historian of science, one must question whether novels are ever really adequate source material for the construction of a hypothesis regarding nonfictional understandings of causality and probability. Paul Ricoeur reminds us inTime and Narrative(Chicago, 1984–1988) that literature has been seen since ancient times as “an ethical laboratory where the artist pursues through the mode of fiction experimentation with values” (Vol. 1, p. 59): fiction is thus both tethered to, yet at the same time distinct from, the world of the actual and the real. Kern acknowledges this to be so, yet his theory of mimesis, of realistic representation, seems to exclude any genuine engagement with tropes of playfulness, indeterminacy, symbolism, and ambiguity that mark literature just as deeply as any desire to replicate the real. Kern notes that he relies “primarily on novels by male authors about male murderers, because [his] method is comparative and requires controlling variables to focus on historical change” (p. 21). This seems to evade a broader question about the extent to which novels can be understood as “evidence” in any sense at all, or whether Kern should be focusing on trial reports rather than their fictionalized representations. This difficulty would be obviated if the focus of the work were an understanding of the impact of developments in scientific theory on narrative form, yet Kern seems reluctant to move fully in this direction. And indeed, if the ideal reader ofA Cultural History of Causalityis in fact a literary critic, he or she may be inclined to probe a number of Kern’s other assumptions as well—he is perhaps a little too inclined to assert that the Victorian novel is artistically “tidy,” that its patterns of closure are always neat and carefully wrought, as an expression of what Thomas Vargish has called “the providential aesthetic” in his study of the same name (Virginia, 1985). Scholars of nineteenth‐century fiction may perhaps feel that Kern’s descriptions of such neat closures sit uncomfortably with their readings ofBleak House(which is as much about the loss and destruction of evidence as it is about its recovery and careful explication) orOur Mutual FriendorDaniel DerondaorThe Brothers Karamazov(each of which problematizes our sense of a character’s relentless movement toward transgression, judgment, and punishment or acquittal). One is left with a sense that Kern occasionally deploys the term “Victorian” in a rather unsophisticated fashion: as Thomas has shown inDetective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science,even the most carefully crafted detective story of the nineteenth century can raise for readers and critics crucial questions about individual and national identity and the power of public surveillance. Yet these criticisms should not undermine a reader’s sense of Kern’s achievement in this book: it is a vast, ambitious attempt to effect a synthesis of scientific thought and literary experimentation, and on the whole it succeeds well.<br>

Author(s): Browning,  Don S.<br>
Abstract: While this book will be of great interest to Christian ethicists as well as to religious and moral educators, it should also be read by social scientists, philosophers, and evolutionary psychologists. Browning’s view that nontheological disciplines depend on images of the human that play a guiding role for their research, as well as for the interpretation of their results, points to the continued need for more interdisciplinary work. According to this point of view, theology should play a public role in identifying such prescientific or preempirical images as well as in describing and advancing refined and responsible images based on the Christian tradition. The present volume goes a long way in either direction.<br>

Abstract: My encounter with this student suggests another way of thinking about the political value of rewriting. Countering all the more blasé signals my students were giving me that it was most naive to think the retelling of stories from another point of view could have any political impact, it is evidence that women’s rewritings of classic texts can still affect young women, still make them think and make them want to contribute to the discussions, the debates that shape the public sphere. Although we need, of course, to factor in serendipity—the student was on holiday and thought she had discovered a little‐known book when in fact it was a
      New York Timesbest seller—there is definitely a sense in which her discovery marked a moment in her life and signals the development of a feminist consciousness (broadly defined as a certain awareness of gender identity combined with a critical position in respect to misogyny and patriarchy and a conviction that things can be changed). There is no denying that increasing individualization at all levels of society has caused the loss of a sense of collective action and political projects. This is equally true for ideas of improvement, emancipation, and modernization, the responsibility of which has largely been shifted to the individual, whose “human rights,” as Bauman argues, are redefined as “the right of individuals to stay different and to pick and choose at will their own models of happiness and fitting life‐style” (2000;2005, 29). In this deregulated and privatized sociopolitical context that knows no common cause, re‐vision can only fail to formulate enabling fictions for a better future for all. Yet in its capacity to speak to individuals, it can still draw them into visions of community and collectivity. Re‐vision may thus not be the lifeline that is to haul us out of patriarchy any more, but as a structure of address that engages readers into contemplating differences, it remains one of the ways in which we keep sane and critical and thinking, moved by the stories of long‐forgotten lives into participating in an open public sphere.<br>

Abstract: In this article, we have argued that the application of library practice requires a suspension of truth. We support this by introducing a new theory of truth that is rooted in historicism. One of the overarching missions of library practice is to acquire, manage, preserve, and make accessible human knowledge. While there are pragmatic and sociopolitical considerations that often constrict fulfillment of this mission, the public purpose of librarianship in a free and open society nonetheless dictates that materials be made accessible regardless of what the society at the current time or the majority of people within a culturally defined place consider as true.<br>

Abstract: [[START 06A00080]] Methods/Theory from either Gibbon's or Pocock's point of view, in the making of the first volume of the Decline and Fall. In Pocock's summary of Gibbon, the Augustan principate was a system that bumped along for a quarter millennium until, following fifty years of mili- tary anarchy, the Illyrian Diocletian divided the empire into two halves ruled by two senior and two junior emperors. Diocletian himself abandoned any remain- ing pretence that the emperor was merely princeps and imperator, openly assuming virtually an Asiatic despo- tism, styled dominus and secluded from public access. This set the stage for the establishment of an entirely new kind of regime under Constantine in the next generation. The very resilience of the Augustan-Anto- nine system up to that point posed narrative and explanatory challenges for Gibbon in itself, since it occurred despite runs of weak emperors, intermittent monsters (Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Ca- racalla), the progressive emasculation of the senate (effectively completed by Septimius Severus early in the third century), and the growing independence of the military. Gibbon's flowing recit is bracketed by peintures (the gallicisms are Pocock's) of Antonine civilization at the start and of Christianity in chapter fifteen. In between the beginning and end of his volume, Gibbon appears to have realized that he had, in a way, painted himself into a corner, given that he had over a thousand years still to narrate, and a radical shift in priorities and design proved necessary. Future volumes of the Decline and Fall would give both the foreign tribes and the Christians much greater prom- inence, and before the last volume's conclusion, a Tacitean account of the decline and fall of western antiquity would evolve into an "enlightened narrative" of the triumph of barbarism and religion, recovery from which had only really begun in Gibbon's own age of civility. This volume is every bit as persuasive as its prede- cessors and, perhaps because it is as much recit as the others were peintures, it is also rather more compelling a read. More than the first two volumes of his work, volume three of Barbarism and Religion leaves one hanging; like Gibbon and his first readers, we are only at the Milvian Bridge, pondering what will follow with Constantine. One hopes that, unlike those readers, we will not have to wait five years for the next episode. DANIEL WOOLF University of Alberta [[END 06A00080]] [[START 06A00090]] LAWRENCE W. MCBRIDE, editor. Reading Irish Histories: Texts, Contexts, and Memory in Modem Ireland. Port- land, Oreg.: Four Courts Press. 2003. Pp. 233. $55.00. The final essay of this collection closes with the following sentiment from Sean Farrell Moran: "Like Socrates and Plato who stood firmly against the influ- ence of myth in Athenian democracy, academic histo- rians will step in to attempt to correct the misconcep- tions of Irish citizens" (p. 218). In the previous essay, one such "academic historian," Ben Novick, stepped into the breach in the following fashion: "Writing, as discussed throughout this book, is a primary means of disseminating information" (p. 211). Socrates and Plato have indeed met their match. It is perhaps unfortunate that this collection, edited by Lawrence W. McBride, closes with one of the most arrogant pieces of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The conceit of the comparison quoted above, and the condescension of statements such as "Perhaps we should pity the peasants. They made the mistake of remembering their past incor- rectly" and "The common Irish man and woman must then be re-educated about Ireland's past and abandon their memories" (p. 218), make it difficult to commend the essay as a fine conclusion to an exceptional book. One can only hope that Moran is trying to be ironic. But it would be unfair to condemn this book on the basis of one author's misguided faith in the powers of the "academic historian." Indeed, the book, although most worthy at times, has enough problems without that. The intention of the collection is clearly estab- lished in the editor's preface: to "examine how a variety of historical narratives were delivered through the written word, but with special attention paid to how readers might have reacted to these texts" (p. 13). The difficulty is that the reader is the one consistent absentee from the essays that follow. From Paul Townend's chapter on the reading rooms of the na- tional movements of the late nineteenth century to Novick's chapter on the newspaper of the Irish Volun- teers, the reader is little more than a shadowy figure. Even the most basic details are ignored; there is no attempt to estimate circulation figures for books or newspapers. Anne Kane's attempts at "reconstructing" (p. 46) what a newspaper reader during the land war might have felt amounts to little more than an essay in speculative sociology. Paul Ricoeur and Clifford Geertz seem to get more attention than the actual people who "may have" (p. 46) and "could well have" (p. 56) responded to the newspapers examined. It also seems unlikely that any farmer facing eviction could have conceived of the land war as a "ritual process" (p. 45). But Kane's essay is not the only one at fault in this fashion. The extent of the readers' absence almost begs one to question why the editor made such a particular point of drawing "special attention" to the reader at all. This is not a fault particular to this book or to these essays. Beyond specific accounts by a reader reacting to a text, which in turn have all the inherent linguistic and interpretative pitfalls of any other text, there are very few ways to interpret the readers' response to any type of narrative. Timothy McMahon is one of the few authors in this collection who actually quotes from the men and women who attended the Gaelic Summer Colleges that he examines. His essay is one of the collection's most valuable as a result. Colin Barr's piece on university education, again valuable in its factual content, has nothing to say about the students or how the changes in the universities effected them AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 471 APRIL 2004 [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00090]] Reviews of Books and Films and their learning. The academic career of one Galway student, H. Fitzwalter Kirker, is traced in its entirety, but only in a footnote. The reader gets at least something approximating a lifeline in the piece by McBride on the young reader and the teaching and learning of Irish history. That "young people are by nature curious" (p. 114), however, seems an inade- quate point on which to hang a conclusion. The book is at its strongest in the essays by Jose Lanters and Gregory Castle, which focus on the work of T. W. Rolleston and Standish O'Grady, respectively. Both historians are examined in the context of their contemporaries; both essays actually attempt to fulfill the claims they make for themselves in their opening pages. The same cannot be said, however, for Eileen Reilly's piece on J. A. Froude. Its bland rehearsal of his life is punctuated with references to his visits to Ireland and quotations from some of his more offen- sive diatribes on the Irish people. She offers little or no comment on the bigotry that billowed forth from his pen. For example, one is told of Froude's dislike for Daniel O'Connell but not the reason why. Novick's piece on the military education of the Irish Volunteers begins with an interesting description, but it is rather disappointing thereafter. Although the material is fascinating, the author's conclusions are not. At one point, he deduces that "The pattern of military education seen in the Irish Volunteer and the Workers' Republic lends weight to the idea of the Rising as blood sacrifice, since the key strategist, Joseph Plunkett, never wrote military columns for the Irish Volunteer" (p. 198). At no point does it occur to Novick that the rebels might not have printed their plans in the paper because letting the authorities in Dublin Castle know in advance was not really part of the plan. How useful, indeed, is an examination of the Irish Volunteer's role in the training of the rebels when even the author concedes that details of training on urban insurrection were "left to the writers of the Workers' Republic" (p. 210); when the author gives approximately nine lines of consideration to what he adjudges to be the more important source? Through- out there is little sense of the eye of Dublin Castle watching over what was published and curtailing what could be written. This is a worthy but a frustrating book. There is a lot of value in each essay in terms of the material that is brought to light, but there is also the crushing weight of the artificial framework under which the essays are forced to labor. Like Froude, it is perhaps this book's "portion in life to please no one faction" (p. 140). ANNE DOLAN Trinity College Dublin [[END 06A00090]] [[START 06A00100]] COLIN NEWBURY. Patrons, Clients, and Empire: Chief- taincy and Over-Rule in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. New York: Oxford University Press. 2003. Pp. xii, 328. $72.00. It is a brave historian nowadays who admits that his or her current academic preoccupations began in the 1950s, but an unrepentant Colin Newbury tells us that imperial history at Oxford University is peculiarly marked by continuity. He says that literary theory has dominated the study of discourse for too long (al- though presumably not at Oxford), and it is time to get back to the study of political discourse using the time-honored model of patron-client relations. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of African and Pacific imperial history, with the addition of material on South and Southeast Asia, Newbury presents a well researched and cogently argued case for the persis- tence of precolonial clientage networks in certain British and French colonies. Patron-client modeling was refined by social scientists in the 1960s and 1970s, when it became a useful way of explaining why inde- pendence had brought relatively little change to the administrative systems of former colonies. That polit- ical and economic relations in some colonies can be analyzed effectively using this theory is clear; whether the exercise speaks to wider debates about empire is another question. The omission of colonies of settle- ment, along with almost all of the Portuguese, Dutch, and German empires, weakens the case considerably. Newbury draws on a wide, although extremely selec- tive, range of secondary literature to supplement his own research, wisely conceding that authors may not like the use he makes of their material. He feels no need to address the epistemological and methodolog- ical concerns raised by authors whose work he mines for empirical detail. He excludes pioneering cross- disciplinary studies, such as Jean and John Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution (1991) and Nicholas Thomas, Colonialism's Culture: Anthropology, Travel and Government (1994), which have done so much to shape current debates in postcolonial anthropology. Newbury calls for more interaction between social scientists and historians, but he does surprisingly little to encourage it. If patron-client brokerage really is the best model, Newbury should be able to tackle other theories with confidence, demonstrating their inade- quacies through constructive engagement. Instead he revives battles won long ago, such as the critique of "collaboration" and "indirect rule" analysis. There are still some historians who work with these terms, but far more interesting is the much larger number of scholars tackling more recent debates. This book's contribution to imperial historiography is therefore difficult to assess. Newbury hopes that it will help to determine whether imperial rule suc- ceeded or failed "in 'preparing' [its colonies] for the exigencies and responsibilities of devolved govern- ment" (p. viii). One wonders whether this is still a pressing question, however. It has been a long time since independence for many of the countries Newbury discusses. Scholars posing broader questions about colonialism's legacy will wonder about the cost of Newbury's ruthlessly exclusive approach.

Abstract: [[START 02P0009T]] Review Essay Strategies of Narrative Synthesis in American History THOMAS BENDER [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY, a new American history has been written.1 This rewriting of American history has often been associated with the "triumph" of social history within the discipline, but in fact the transformation is much broader than that: the domain of the historical has been vastly extended, inherited narratives displaced, new subjects and narratives introduced. While at the monographic level, one sees similar developments in various national historiographies, national synthesis-and the idea of a national synthesis- seems to have been less troubled elsewhere than in the field of U.S. history. Admittedly, generalization is risky, especially if one reaches into historiographies with which one is barely familiar. Still, I think that a variety of outstanding national histories (or histories of a people sometimes treated as nations) have been more confident of established narrative strategies. With the exception of the historians of France that I will note, historians of other modern nations seem to have had fewer doubts about the basic framing of a narrative synthesis, and they have not felt compelled to develop new approaches, even though in many cases the other work of the authors involved has been strikingly innovative.2 Yet the social, intellectual, and political developments that have complicated American historiography are likely, I suspect, to make themselves felt in other national historiographies fairly soon, a point recently made by Jacques Revel, a leading French historian.3 And that circumstance may spawn a generation of controversy about the politics and strategies of synthesis. If so, the American case may be of more general import and interest. Beginning in the 1940s, intellectual history became the synthesizing subfield in U.S. history. reDlacing the political-economic narratives of Frederick Jackson [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] I wish to thank the editors of the AHR, first, for inviting me to consider the issues in this essay, second, for the helpful comments of Acting Editor Jeffrey Wasserstrom, and, third, for the quite stimulating commentary of several anonymous reviewers. 1 See Eric Foner, ed., The New American History (Philadelphia, 1990); Foner, ed., The New American History, rev. and expanded edn.

Beard.4 But during the 1970s, the claims being made for a national mind or culture were challenged by social historians. Intellectual history was chastened and transformed by the confrontation with social history. Eschewing their former embrace of synthesis, intellectual historians pulled back to study more precisely defined themes and thinkers.5 Not only intellectual history but other subfields accommodated social history's provocation to rethink conventional gen- eralizations. In addition, a professional, even "social-scientific," concern for precision and specificity of reference collaborated-sometimes with forethought, often not-with a sharpened awareness of difference and conflict that came from social movements outside the academy to undermine older composite narratives. Neither the frame supplied by Charles and Mary Beard in The Rise of American Civilization (1927), with its dramatic narrative of conflict between the "people" and the "interests," nor the consensual pluralism that succeeded that interpretation in the 1950s survived.6 If the consensus historians underplayed conflict, the Beards' approach, for all of its sympathy for the dispossessed, was found to be inadequate as well. Their narrative revealed little feel for the diversity of Americans, and it paid scant attention to non-whites. Most important of all, while their narrative voice was sympathetic, one did not discover the quotidian life or hear the voices of those groups that have found voice in more recent historiography. Judged by newer historiographical expectations, The Rise of American Civilization seemed "thin," compared with the increasingly popular "thick" description that was built, in part, on the enormously influential anthropological work of Clifford Geertz.7 In the past quarter century, there has been a proliferation of exciting new research, much of it bringing previously overlooked or explicitly excluded groups and events into the light of history. The number and variety of American stories multiplied. Suddenly, there were histories where there had been none or where the available histories had not been attended to by professional historians: histories of African Americans in the era of slavery and beyond; of Native Americans; of workers at home in their communities, at work, and at play; of women at home and outside of the home and of gender relations more generally; of consumption as well as production; of ethnic minorities and "borderlands"; of popular culture and other "marginal" forms of cultural production; of objects and material culture; of whites and whiteness as historical subjects; of non-state international and intercultural relations; and much more. [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 4Frederick Jackson Turner never completed a major synthesis, but one can see how he might have done that work in his posthumously published The United States, 1830-1850 (New York, 1935); Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, The Rise of American Civilization (1927; 2 volumes in 1, New York, 1930).. In fact, the Beards participated in this shift with the publication of The American Spirit: A Study of the Idea of Civilization in the United States (New York, 1942). 5 For an early anticipation of this development-from the point of view of intellectual history-see Lawrence Veysey, "Intellectual History and the New Social History," in Paul K.

These developments were occurring at a moment when the number of American historians was expanding to an unprecedented degree. Disciplinary expansion both allowed and prompted increased specialization. And that worried some, who began to speak of hyperspecialization and fragmentation. The structure of specialization derived in large part from the impact of a social history that often fused the group-based particularity of focus with ideological commitments to class and identity-based social movements. This pattern of work discouraged the integration of particular histories into some kind of synthesis.8 Traditionalists, perhaps not surprisingly, were unnerved by these develop- ments.9 But even some proponents of the newer history worried. Early on, Herbert G. Gutman, one of the leading figures in the movement to write a history that included all Americans and that recognized differences-class, ethnic, racial, gender-was concerned that instead of enriching and enlarging the usable history of the United States, the new scholarship was failing to do that, perhaps making it in fact less usable. The "new social history," he wrote in the introduction to his collection of pioneering essays in the field, "suffers from a very limiting overspe- cialization." Take an Irish-born Catholic female textile worker and union organizer in Fall River involved in a disorderly strike in 1875. She might be the subject of nearly a dozen sub-specializations, which would, he feared, "wash out the wholeness that is essential to understanding human behavior."10 Later, in the wake of a national meeting of writers at which historians and history seemed to be largely ignored in discussions of the political and cultural situation in the aftermath of Richard Nixon, Gutman mused aloud in the pages of The Nation over whether the failure of historians to incorporate social history's findings into a new synthesis had seriously diminished, even evacuated, history's possible contribution to public debate."1 In the mid-1980s, in what turned out to be a controversial pair of articles, I raised a related question: how might one construct the (to my mind) needed synthesis of recent historiography on the United States.12 There was considerable negative reaction to those articles, coming from two different positions.

These arguments were equated with a carelessness about scholarly rigor.13 The other, and more widespread position, focused on the risks of a national narrative itself. It was evidently feared that such a narrative would, by definition, re-exclude those groups and themes that had so recently been brought under the umbrella of history and would re-inscribe a "master narrative" dominated by white, elite males.14 By the end of the 1980s, however, the question of synthesis had become less controversial. The issue became more practical, more professional in some sense: how to do it and how to do it within the parameters of inclusion that had been central to the discussion from the beginning. It was on this note that Alice Kessler-Harris, the author of the chapter on social history in The New American History (1990 edition), addressed the question. In the last section of her essay, with the section title of "The Problem of Synthesis," she acknowledged the problem and explored various possible ways to overcome "fragmentation" and move toward synthesis.15 A different issue emerged in the 1990s. Poststructuralist literary and cultural theory, sometimes broadly and even more vaguely characterized as postmodernism, was and is suspicious of any aspiration toward a comprehensive narrative. It is to this body of theory that we owe the commonplace use and misuse of the epithet "master narrative."16 These theories have been rather slow to penetrate workaday historical practice among American historians. Levels and types of awareness of them vary: from shocked indignation at the whole idea, to vague awareness and thoughtless dismissal, to intellectual fascination largely in isolation from the making of one's own histories. In his recent book, Beyond the Great Story: History as Text and Discourse (1995), Robert Berkhofer seeks to force more attention to these issues. Insistently, but not always consistently, he urges historians to recognize the dimensions of the postmodern crisis that surrounds them. He seems more interested in sounding the alarm about the quicksand before us than in guiding us [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 13 Eric H.

But either way, he intends to challenge the very possibility of narrative synthesis.17 While these worries, proposals, and polemics were being fashioned, the daily work of historians proceeded. Among the products of that work have been a good number of explicitly synthetic volumes. There is, of course, no clear or settled notion of what defines a work of synthesis. I have used a rather generous definition. Some of the books I am calling synthetic might alternatively be designated as monographs-archivally based but exceptionally ambitious books that tackle big questions and seek to frame a large field or to provide an interpretation for an audience well beyond specialists. Others are more obviously synthetic, relying heavily on secondary literature to establish the state of the art in a broad field for a wide audience, including, often, students and the general public. With this diversity of form, purpose, and audience in mind-as well as a concern for a reasonable distribution of fields and periods-I have, with the help of the editors of the American Historical Review, selected a few recent synthetic works for examina- tion.18 The very existence of these books mutes the question of whether we need synthetic works or whether, under the constraints of present historiographical practice, synthesis is possible. In fact, the seeming proliferation of syntheses at present-and their variousness-suggests that the field of American history is at a formative (or reformative) moment that invites synthesis: the quest for new understandings that has undermined established narratives has now, perhaps, prompted new efforts at crystallizing a very unstable body of historical writing into new syntheses. A different question, however, provides the focus of this essay. What strategies for narrative synthesis are available to historians today? How might we think about the relation between a particular structure of narrative synthesis and the author's purpose or interpretation? How do these different strategies relate to current historiography? What particular work do they do, within the profession and beyond it? And finally I want to ask some questions about the firmness of the boundaries (mostly geographical) that define what is and is not captured in synthetic narratives of U.S. history. These works do not, of course, cover the whole field of synthetic works. More and other books could have been chosen, but these eleven books (and several others mentioned along the way) at least represent different kinds of history, different [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 17 Robert F.

Hine and John Mack Faragher (TheAmerican West). In fact, I have recommended each to non-historians asking for a literate one-volume history of the United States.

Together, the eleven total nearly 6,000 pages of outstanding historical writing. If nothing else, I can conclude that synthetic narrative invites long books. Because I cannot claim special knowledge in any of the fields being synthesized in these books, I do not propose to do the kind of analysis one would find in specialized reviews. Such criticisms that I have will be framed from the position of my interest in synthetic narrative. I say that in part to be honest about my own limitations in appraising these books but also for another, more positive reason. I want to insist that narrative synthesis is a form of knowledge, indeed, a particularly powerful form of creating, not simply summarizing, knowledge. I hope to get past or under the story enough to probe the implications of different modes of structuring a narrative synthesis. The way different narrative strategies construct that knowledge is important. While inclusion is one of the tests our generation will rightly ask of synthesis, there are other important historiographical issues that are embedded in the question of narrative synthesis.19 The more seriously we consider possible narratives of American history, the more we may be prepared to ask questions that press beyond inclusion. We may even be both bold enough and hopeful enough to worry a little about the language of inclusion, if not the principle. Is there perhaps more than a hint of dominant culture noblesse oblige in the language of inclusion? Might not a more sophisticated notion of the temporal and geographical boundaries of American history, including an awareness of the diasporic stories within American history, complicate and enrich the notion of inclusion?20 Can the historical and historiographical terrain be opened a bit more in a way that enables a deeper, denser, and more complex historiographical exploration of justice and difference at the center of American history? Might democracy be the word, the concept, the commitment that will move us in that direction? As I examine the stack of books before me, I propose to keep these issues in mind and to return to them at the end of this essay. JON BUTLER'S Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (2000) covers the whole mainland British colonial space and history, and it addresses a wide range of themes. In fact, themes, not time or chronology, organize his story. His brief, often one-word, chapter titles reveal a very distinctive type of synthesis, one immediately accessible to the reader, whether professional or lay: Peoples, Economy, Politics, Things Material, Things Spiritual. It is a reasonable progression, and in each case he brings together a good deal of material. Although his theme is transformation, Butler also claims (following recent historiography) a more inclusive geography, making more of the middle colonies than would have been the case a generation ago. In some ways, his manner of organizing the material topically bears a relation to [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 19 I do not propose to go into theories of narrative or even my own notions, but I will here indicate that my understanding has been greatly influenced by the work of Paul Ricoeur, Time and Narrative, Kathleen McLaughlin and David Pellauer, trans., 3 vols. (Chicago, 1984-88). 20 Such thinking is not restricted to specialists in the profession exploring the theme of diaspora. The novelist Russell Banks has recently argued that the focus for a synthesis of American history ought to be the African diaspora. See "The Star-Spangled Novel," Los Angeles Times, July 2, 2000.

If Hofstadter's book was intended to provide a snapshot that would serve as a starting point, Butler's title ("Becoming America") and his stated intentions announce change as his theme. He means to persuade the reader of a broad pattern of transformation that produced a distinctive and modern society in advance of 1776 and that in turn spawned the first modern revolution. Such an argument demands more complex and careful attention to process and cause than his framing of the book seems to allow. While he has surely gathered together a considerable body of material (his notes run to fifty pages), he has not produced a synthetic narrative of change over time, one that sketches a develop- mental sequence that integrates disparate elements in the interest of a causal interpretation. By bounding each unit of synthesis, Butler is stuck with a structural isolation of topics that undercuts narrative explanation. Given that Butler's theme is transformation, this narrative structure is crippling. For reasons related to structure and style of argument, Butler's claims for American modernity are quite vulnerable. While there are doubtless some specific ways in which the British North American colonies became "modern" before independence, they were not uniformly modern-over space or in all aspects of life. Many historians would readily grant numerous anticipations of modernity by the middle of the eighteenth century, but few would insist, with Butler, that so much modernity had been achieved so soon, implying that only a few pre-modern anomalies remained on the eve of revolution.22 Most give a significant role to the revolution.23 But the most serious problem is not with the phenomena he notices or does not notice, even if there is some real unevenness on this point. Rather, it is Butler's teleology of the modern, combined with his exceedingly loose, elusive, and, as is so often said today, undertheorized definition of modernity. Add to this an unneces- sary but apparently irresistible tendency to claim American uniqueness and "firsts" for nearly everything he identifies as modern in America. He names a number of phenomena that he considers evidences of the modern-polyglot, slaves, cities, market economy, refined crafts and trades, religious pluralism, and "sophisticated politics." Without further historical specification and theoretical precision, one can indulge in reductio ad absurdum. With the exception of religious pluralism, all of these qualities probably described Athens in the age of Aristotle at least as well as the British colonies. In fact, I suspect that Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker, relying on their recent book The Many-Headed Hydra: Sailors, Slaves, Commoners, and the Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic (2000), would argue that the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 21 Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (New York, 1971). 22 Jon Butler, Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776 (Cambridge, Mass., 2000), 1. 23 See, for example, Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (New York, 1992). Long before, Bernard Bailyn suggested certain developments that Butler would consider modern had developed in the eighteenth century, but he emphasized the unevenness and even paradoxical character of this proto-modernity.

In the end, however, it is diversity, which he tends to equate with multiculturalism, that for Butler makes Americans modern. But if we look around, we cannot but wonder about his claims for a uniquely polyglot society. This assertion may be quite vulnerable from any sight line approaching a global perspective. Can he fairly claim that New York City harbored a level of diversity "never before gathered together"?25 Might not this be as plausibly said of Constantinople during the period covered by Butler's book? And did not the Ottoman Empire-of which Constantinople was the capital-far exceed the religious and ethnic diversity of the British colonies? My point here is partly one of fact, of care in making comparative statements without comparison. More important, however, are the criteria of the modern. Few, if any, major political bodies in the past half millennium more successfully accommodated diversity than the Ottomans, yet that achievement has never brought them recognition for a precocious modernity. One needs greater defini- tional and descriptive specificity to make the argument he claims. Because of the breadth and generality of synthetic narratives, it is especially important to be clear about key concepts. Similarly, he tends to claim the realization of "Americanness"-here equated with some vague notion of modernity-for events that, however interesting in themselves, hardly sustain his assertion that they designated "the American future."26 For example, writing of the French Huguenots, a group he knows well, he notes their assimilation, and he calls this "American."27 Well, of course it is, but so are the endogenous marriages that continue for various groups well into the twentieth century-sometimes because of racial difference and even legislation (as in the case of African Americans) or out of choice, as in the case of Scandinavians in the upper Midwest. Or to take a more ominous subject, it seems a bit fatalistic to say that colonial encroachment on Indian land "predicted" nineteenth-century relations with the Indians.28 Oddly, such a claim, while taking the moral high ground, nonetheless erases the postcolonial history of the United States by denying contingency and thus diminishing both the capacity and moral responsibility of all later actors or potential actors. The twin and linked teleologies of "modern" and "American" produce a distorting and de-historicizing synthesis. If there is a problem with the sort of synthesis Butler has written, what precisely is it? He makes historical claims about patterns and meanings of development on the basis of a narrative structure that effectively isolates and de-historicizes his themes. By not constructing a developmental narrative that integrates the various themes now separated in distinct chapters, the process and complexity of develop- ment is obscured.

In the absence of a narrative of change to explain and interpret, he resorts for a theme to repeated assertions of "modernity." The issue is not so much the claim for an eighteenth-century American modernity-although I am myself drawn to much more complex, nuanced, and contradictory discussions of that theme-as it is the incapacity of the particular model of synthesis he deploys to advance that theme or argument. Philip D. Morgan's Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (1998) is at once similar to Butler's and quite different. Both focus tightly in each chapter on a particular topic or theme; there is little play among the different themes in both cases. While Butler's themes propose a reorganization of material, thus giving an impression of freshness, Morgan's quite important questions are phrased in well-established ways. While Butler's structure works against his theme of transformation, Morgan's similar structure better fits his goals for the book, partly because transformation plays a smaller role in his analysis than one might expect. Slave Counterpoint addresses nearly all the issues raised by a half century of vigorous scholarship on the beginnings of slavery, the practices of racial slavery as a labor and social system, and the nature of African-American culture in early America. It is a book of enviable learning: with a seeming total command of the historiography and an impressive knowledge of a substantial archival base, Morgan proceeds to pose (or re-pose) difficult historiographical issues. Again and again, he offers compelling answers. Want to know what scholarship has disclosed about slavery and African-American culture in the eighteenth-century Chesapeake and Lowcountry? Look to Morgan's synthesis of a generation of scholarship. To have done that is to have done a great deal, and he has done it magnificently. Yet one gets the sense of a summary volume, a volume driven by the past, by past questions. Synthesis can either cap a phase of scholarship or initiate another. I think Morgan's book falls into the former category, while Ira Berlin's new book, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (1998), which also relies on a generation of scholarship and addresses many of the same issues, has the potential to become a new starting point. Berlin has captured the shift to an Atlantic perspective that has increasingly characterized scholarship by early modern Europeanists, Africanists, Latin Americanists, and historians of British North America. In this sense, his work, at least the early parts that sketch out and populate the Atlantic littoral, points forward.29 In a dramatic opening section, Berlin, relying more on secondary literatures than does Morgan, locates his story in very broad understandings of time (periodization) and space (the Atlantic world), the dimensions of which are shadowy, almost invisible, in Morgan's account. He locates Africans in an Atlantic history connecting four continents and in a rich and growing historiography reaching out from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and North America.30 One [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 29 Ira Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge, Mass., 1998). 30 Berlin's powerful evocation of the Atlantic builds on many predecessors. At minimum, mention should be made of Philip D. Curtin's The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison, Wis., 1969); and The AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 138 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] wishes Berlin had sustained this perspective in the later sections. But even if he narrows the story to the territory that later became the United States and loses the multiple histories implied by his portrait of the Atlantic world, the beginnings of stories, whether novels or histories, are heavy with intention and implication that can, I hope, be built upon.31 In fact, the four Atlantic continents remain an always changing aspect of American and African histories. Attending to, or at least recognizing, that larger and continuing extended terrain of American history would enrich the story of the making of African Americans and America, a historiography that is at present too much captured by an implicit and too simple assimilation or "Americanization" model. Nonetheless, Berlin has provided a powerful image of the creation of the Atlantic world and of the origin of modern slavery within it. Morgan has a quite different strategy. His domain is not the Atlantic but the South, or two regions of the South, which he is anxious to reveal as differentiated. Thus his is a comparative history, comparing two regions within the South. Suggesting a certain scientific aspiration, he refers to his delimited space as a kind of laboratory, a site for an "indirect experiment."32 This approach offers him much. He is able to focus tightly on his questions and generally achieves sharply phrased answers. Yet, like any good scientific laboratory, his field of inquiry is almost hermetically sealed. A two-hundred-page part of the book titled "The Black World" begins with a fifteen-page section on "Africans." Yet it is in only one paragraph at the beginning and a few other scattered references that one reads anything about Africa. His story rarely strays east (or south or north or west) of the Maryland/ Virginia and South Carolina boundaries. His comparative method has impressive rigor. Yet one senses that not only does his approach trap him within a particular place, he is also caught within a very confining net woven from the existing historiography. As Walter Johnson pointed out in a review of the book in this journal, his questions are smaller than the stories he has unearthed.33 Much like another important book on African-American history, Herbert G. Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom (1976), this book, for all its synthetic aspirations, cannot capture some of its best material within the tightly bounded historiographical questions and issues that frame it.34 As in the case of Berlin's book, Morgan's is quite explicit about time and space. There is a well-thought-out chronology of change, and one of his major arguments is that the South, and thus the black as well as white experience, was not uniform over space. He shows real and important distinctions between the experience of [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex (New York, 1990; 2d edn., 1998); and John K.

Yet by treating both the temporal and spatial aspects of the story as sites (and very limited ones) rather than as processes of historical making, he weakens the capacity of his local analyses to explain change over time and, to a lesser extent, space. His major explanatory claims appear in the introduction. They are not only brief but also separate from the rich stories he tells and the analyses he makes of historiographical questions.35 The expansiveness of Many Thousands Gone, by contrast, evokes a strong sense of change, of process. It achieves a narrative synthesis of the movement of Africans onto the Atlantic and into the Western hemisphere. The difference between this approach and the tightly controlled analysis crafted by Morgan is striking. Like Morgan's, Michael Schudson's book, The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Life (1998), is organized around fairly established questions- especially one big question. Has American civic life deteriorated over the course of the past three centuries? Naturally, the question is of a different order than those driving Morgan's analysis. It has not been generated by disciplinary scholarship. It arose out of American public life. Schudson thus draws on history and other disciplines to address directly a public question, one endlessly repeated today and, as he shows, in the past. Schudson himself, we should note, is not a historian. He was trained as a sociologist, and he teaches in a Department of Communication. While he reveals an impressive command of the relevant historiography, historians are not his primary reference group or audience.36 Although I am sure specialists will find some of his formulations to be of considerable historiographical significance and likely to encourage new lines of research, his intention, again, is different: his audience is a general one, and he seeks to bring historical knowledge to bear on a civic issue. What he is doing points toward the most important work that one kind of successful narrative synthesis can do, for the profession and for the public. By openly declaring his address to a public issue and for a public audience, Schudson participates in a very important tradition of historical writing. Some of the very best professional historians of the United States in this century have done precisely that: Frederick Jackson Turner, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles Beard, and Richard Hofstadter all focused on issues, worries, or preoccupations of fairly general interest to write synthetic works that importantly rephrased fundamental themes in American history. This mutual enrichment of public and professional discourse is perhaps the ideal cultural work of narrative synthesis. Let us hope that historians can do this more often and more effectively. Yet as I make this point, I realize that all of the historians just named, including Schudson himself, were either trained as social scientists or did not recognize a significant boundary between history and the [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 35Morgan, Slave Counterpoint, xv-xxiv. I should note that my concerns about boundary setting in Morgan's book do not apply nearly so much to Philip D. Morgan, "The Black Experience in the British Empire, 1680-1810," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, Vol. 2: The Eighteenth Century, P. J. Marshall, ed. (Oxford, 1998), 465-86. 36 This command is at once impressive and sometimes puzzling. In discussing the Founding and the Constitution, he does not mention Gordon Wood's The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787 (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1969). Nor, in writing about the first decades of the nineteenth century, does he mention either of two key books by Robert H. Wiebe, The Opening of American Society: From the Adoption of the Constitution to the Eve of Disunion (New York, 1984); and Self-Rule: A Cultural History of American Democracy (Chicago, 1995). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW FEBRUARY 2002 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 140 Thomas Bender [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] (other?) once more expansive social sciences. Is this a mere coincidence, or is it an issue to be addressed by the profession? While I would not place Schudson's book in the same class as the scholarship produced by the short list of great historians, he has written a fine book. It is a book about change over time, and he establishes three eras of citizenship and participa- tion, each clearly defined. He does not devote much attention to how each configuration changes into the next, but he effectively characterizes their differ- ences, even in some very brief summaries, as in the following paragraph from early in the book: Another way to characterize the past three hundred years of political change is to say that the type of authority by which society is governed shifted from personal authority (gentlemen) to interpersonal authority (parties, coalitions, and majorities), to impersonal authority (science, expertise, legal rights, and information) ... The geographical center of politics has shifted from the countryside to the cities to the suburbs and perhaps, today, to "technoburbs," "postsuburbs," or "edge cities," or whatever we name our newer habitations. Correspondingly, the kind of knowledge a good citizen requires has changed: in an age of gentlemen, the citizen's relatively rare entrances into public discussion or controversy could be guided by his knowledge of social position; in the era of rule by majorities, the citizen's voting could be led by the enthusiasm and rhetoric of parties and their most active partisans; in the era of expertise and bureaucracies, the citizens had increasingly to learn to trust their own canvass of newspapers, interest groups, parties, and other sources of knowledge, only occasionally supported by the immediacy of human contact; and in the emerging age of rights, citizens learn to catalog what entitlements they may have and what forms of victimization they may knowingly or unknowingly have experienced.37 This paragraph reveals the argument and the narrative strategy that Schudson uses to undercut the widespread notion of civic decline: rather than a story of decline, it is one of restructuring, one that recalibrates citizenship and civic practice in relation to changing values and social experiences. What some, including me, see as the erosion of our public life and the thinning of American political culture, he presents as a complex rearticulation of expectations and institutions. Whether one fully agrees with Schudson or not, the book and the point of view it ingeniously argues constitutes an important contribution of contemporary civic life. And a narrative strategy of restructuring (as opposed to the usual rise or fall scenarios) deserves a place in the historian's menu of narrative types. "Presentist" purposes may, however, carry the danger of anachronistic readings. Schudson is vulnerable on this score, especially in his consideration of the colonial period. He too easily asks how democratic any phase of political life was. A commitment to explore the fate of democracy in our past-something I endorse- surely includes recognizing when democracy is not an available concept. He might better have asked how the legitimation and exercise of power worked. Indeed, such a deeper historicism would complement his anti-anti-Whig approach. Similarly, while a then-and-now binary invites sometimes interesting questions and offers some illumination of past and present, it also invites problems. Again, one sees this risk in Schudson's work. False categories of judgment are explicitly or implicitly brought to bear.

Voters then were expected to have "local knowledge-not of laws or principles, but of men."38 The binary obscures the role of principles in the past and knowledge of men in the present. Most important of all, it diverts our attention from the principles that it was thought would aid voters in judging character.39 Sometimes, by focusing so much on the party system that we worry about today, he overlooks those important issues that eluded the parties or that parties avoided. Substantive issues-the reason citizenship and civic life are important-are marginalized in his account of the different concepts and patterns of public life. The result, whether intended or not, is a form of consensus history.40 "Progress or decline is not the real question," Schudson concludes.41 He converts that question into one of restructuring that points to his core argument: there must be a fit between forms of citizenship and forms of everyday life, between values and institutions, between aspirations and commitments. It is that historically informed understanding that allows him in his conclusion to speculate in quite promising ways about an evolving pattern of citizenship that may yet serve our collective hopes and needs. Still, his conclusion leaves me uneasy. Like the journalistic coverage of politics today, the substance of political conflict is subordinated to discussion of the "health" of the system, of the institutions and practices. By contrast, the tensions, conflicts, and substantive issues that made politics so important in the development of the United States and in the lives of individuals are at the center of Eric Foner's The Story of American Freedom (1998). Foner's book has an uncanny resemblance to one that at first glance might seem utterly unrelated: Richard Hofstadter's The American Political Tradition and the Men Who Made It.42 Of course, Foner inverts the point Hofstadter sought to make. If Hofstadter famously played down conflict and (less remarked upon) paid little attention to the social making of political ideologies, Foner emphasizes conflict and the changing historical construction and reconstruction of the idea and ideology of freedom. Foner's work is much more explicitly sensitive to social history, even if it parallels Hofstadter's in its interest in ideology and the limits and possibilities of American political culture. While Hofstadter was alternately comic and ironic, bitterly so at times, in The American Political Tradition, Foner's Story of American Freedom is strikingly fair and straightforward. Yet the underlying hope is similar. As James Oakes has perceptively noted, Foner's narrative is undergirded by an unstated but firm liberal ideal of freedom- one that at once shares in an Enlightenment universalism and [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 38 Schudson, Good Citizen, 81. 39 See Joyce Appleby, Inheriting the Revolution: The First Generation of Americans (Cambridge, Mass., 2000). 40 See, for example, his summary judgment of the party system at Schudson, Good Citizen, 132.

Both appraised American political culture and its prospects from the position of a richer, more textured liberalism than we usually recognize in current debates.44 In thinking about the core issue in Foner's narrative, therefore, it seems fair to consider it to be the quest for a democratic liberalism, insisting on the relevance and indispensability of the modifier inserted before liberalism. One might thus characterize Foner's as a democratic synthesis, which, as I suggested above, offers a stronger and more egalitarian standard of judgment than commonplace invoca- tions of inclusion. It offers as well the implication of voice and empowerment. To Foner, as he indicates in his introduction, "abstract definitions" of freedom are not the focus. His concern is "with the debates and struggles through which freedom acquires concrete meanings, and how understandings of freedom are shaped by, and in turn help to shape, social movements and political and economic events."45 The result is a narrative that is at once focused yet always open to an examination of larger issues, structures, and events that intersect with and often drive his story. It is a dynamic story, filled with actors, with agents making freedom and using freedom. He selects key events or controversies of different eras, events that are widely contested (slavery, labor and property, the role of the state, social movements). Of course, coverage is selective; the gain is the richness deriving from a series of concentrated focal points. In each case, he examines the conflict, the parties contending, and the stakes. He does not hesitate to declare justices and injustices, to name winners and losers, and he does so from a consistently democratic perspective. Foner thus achieves inclusion without the dilution conse- quent with the faux openness characteristic of talk radio and without the postmod- ern hesitations that undermine moral judgment.46 The American West: A New Interpretive History (2000) by Robert V. Hine and John Mack Faragher spans the whole of American history, from "the European invasion" until the present.47 The book is written in the spirit of Frederick Jackson Turner. Instead of lamenting the ambiguity of Turner's conception of the frontier, which after Turner got reduced by rigorous historians to a place, the West, Hine and Faragher embrace its fullness.

That openness allows them to tell the history of the United States as a story of successive frontiers, including a fascinating rethinking of American regionalism as urban-centered at the end of the twentieth century.48 In fact, the chapter on the postwar era is a tour de force-imaginative, original, and quite compelling. In Turnerian fashion, they argue that "westering defined America's unique heritage."49 To a very impressive degree, they give substance to this claim, but recent historiography makes that claim, even for western history, problematic. As Hine and Faragher show, in the nineteenth century as well as today, the West (and the United States) was formed by migrations from west to east and south to north, and even in a limited way north to south, as well as east to west. The notion of westering is so strong in American and European history and culture, it is difficult to construct an alternative narrative structure, though no less important for the difficulty.50 This worry does not, however, undercut another summary point they make: the "frontier is our common past."51 The book is grounded in social history. Of all the books under consideration here, The American West is probably the most sensitive to the categories of experience and groups previously excluded from mainstream narratives of Ameri- can history. Their work goes well beyond mere representation of such groups and categories; previously invisible groups, whether Native Americans, migrating women, African-American settlers, working people, or the people of the border- lands, are actors who contributed to the shaping of history. But there are limits to this achievement. While there are multiple positions and voices represented in their narrative, only rarely does their narrative bring the reader inside group life. There is not much inquiry into the interior experience and subjective meanings shared by the various groups identified and recognized.52 While the story could have been situated in a wider context, one that revealed the global reach of the empires or, later, the importance of global markets, in its particular geographical focus the book consistently avoids privileging the English line of settlement. Other settler efforts are considered and sometimes compared. As is often the case with synthetic histories, however, there is a tendency to do the work of inclusion at a particular moment, and then lose the group at issue.

At times, the transnational themes they develop are extremely illuminating. They refer to what would later be characterized by theorists of the global cities as a "dual economy" in describing the role of foreign migrants, especially Chinese, in the nineteenth-century California agricultural economy.53 Likewise the interplay of national and international in their discussion of the Zimmerman telegram inviting Mexico to ally with Germany in World War I and in their discussion of San Francisco's "commercial hinterland."54 But, as in the case of Butler's book, there is a bit of parochialism in making claims of distinction. Perhaps such assertions can be demonstrated, but more rigorous definitions and empirical research than we have here are required to establish, for example, that the United States is today the world's most multicultural society.55 How would it compare with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation, whose citizens speak more than 100 languages and live on almost numberless islands? The social-history approach, whatever its success in representing difference, has in this instance under-represented national political institutions and policies. The development of the West, as Richard White and other historians of the West have pointed out, was profoundly indebted to what western Republicans now call "big government," for water, transportation, Indian removal, and, more recently, direct investment, as in defense contracts and installations and aerospace industries.56 The political economy and the role of markets, as has already been suggested, do not get the attention they deserve. We often overlook how much industry was in the West, and how much western industries-from milling and meatpacking to mining-were integral to the industrial system of the United States. And we forget how much the astonishing productivity of western agriculture enabled the formation of a large urban industrial labor supply. More of these dimensions of western history might have been included if only in the interest in enabling the story better to tell the national experience. If Hine and Faragher encompass both the full geographical and temporal dimensions of western history, Linda Gordon's microhistory builds out from a very delimited western space, the Sonoran highlands of Arizona, to develop a highly innovative narrative synthesis that locates itself at the various and causally interrelated scales of town, region, nation, and the transnational. Her work reminds us that there is a difference between a mere local study and a microhistory. The local histories of villages, towns, and cities, so common in the 1970s, tended to use global concepts but within artificially bounded fields of inquiry. One of the most famous of them all, Kenneth Lockridge's study of Dedham, Massachusetts, offered an isolated inwardness as a principal finding, although it was a finding that derived [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 53Hine and Faragher, American West, 358-60. 54 Hine and Faragher, American West, 395-97, 414.

Mostly, her account is the story of the arrival and fate of Catholic orphans from New York who were to be placed in Catholic homes. The homes were Mexican as well as Catholic, and that was the problem and the focus of conflict. The conflict played out along class, ethnic, religious, and gender lines, and it eventually reached the Supreme Court. It is a compelling and very human narrative, but one that also addresses a whole range of analytical and interpretive issues of broader interest to historians. Bringing the issues of gender, class, and race into relation with each other allows for an appraisal of their relative importance in this particular historical explanation. I think that her story reveals class to be more important than her conclusion argues, but the real point to be made is that only a narrative synthesis that brings diverse threads together will enable the historian and the reader to make this kind of judgment. These complex ends are achieved in part by her adoption of an imaginative literary strategy. Gordon's book is constructed of two types of chapters. One is quite often a broad frame for local events. In these chapters, her perspective as narrator is exterior to the action. The issues addressed are frequently structural and, as often as not, extend beyond the community. Here, one gets an analytical explanation of the relation of local experience to larger national and international cultural, political, and economic developments. Between these chapters, she has crafted others that get inside the culture of the community, providing wonderfully rich, thick descriptions of daily life and the development of the conflict. With oral histories as well as fragmentary documentary evidence, she brings the reader very close to the experience and voices of the community. The play between these accounts and the more conventional chapters produces an unusual but powerful synthesis. Whether a microhistory qualifies as a synthesis, even by my generous definition, may be debated. But the singular relevance of this book for the discussion of synthesis concerns not scale but its literary ambition, the literary experiment that gives structure to the book. Those who would write other syntheses-at various scales-will, I hope, be encouraged, even inspired, to experiment with novel narrative strategies in the interest of more powerful representations of the past. Quintard Taylor presents a third version of western history, In Search of the Racial Frontier: African Americans in the American West, 1528-1990 (1998). He offers a broad synthetic account that characterizes the experiences of African Americans over a very long period of time.

Drawing on a substantial body of scholarship, most of it published in the past quarter century, he aims to "reconstruct the history of African American women and men" in the West over five centuries, although mostly his focus is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Taylor's central themes are the quest for community by blacks and the relative degrees of freedom and opportunity they find in different times and places. The conjuncture of the map of African-American presence and the conventional history of the West that his story brings out compels rethinking of both African-American and western history. He makes the point, for example, that the issue of Texas independence in 1836 was not simply, as myth, even the more recent multicultural version, would have it: Anglos and Tejanos in Texas confronting a despotic government in Mexico. It was also an Anglo effort to preserve slavery.60 More broadly, the map literally reveals that African Americans in the West were overwhelmingly city and town dwellers, and it is that fact that unifies their experience. The kind of synthetic narrative that he has constructed provides an invaluable service at a particular moment, crystallizing a generation of scholarship, making generalization possible. His work not only informs the public of the dimensions of previously unrecognized histories, it also provides a base for the next generation of scholarship. In a similar way, another recent synthesis, one that focuses on a more narrowly defined but also more developed area of scholarship, reveals the harvest of recent scholarship on work and workers. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and Vhite Labor (1998) by Jacqueline Jones at once brings this rich scholarship to a wider audience and proffers a fresh way of framing the field.61 If The American West, In Search of the Racial Frontier, and American Work cover very long chronological spans, books by David M. Kennedy and Fred Anderson address short periods. Their focus is also quite different, since both concentrate on political and military history. Kennedy's Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945 (1999) addresses what might well be called "high politics," while Anderson's The Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766 (2000) brings social history and high politics into fruitful play, finding in that interaction the terms of his central argument about the nature of power in the British Empire. At the outset, both books locate their stories in a broad international context. Kennedy's book begins at the close of World War I, and the first character introduced is Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler, who was in a military hospital recovering from a poison gas attack when he heard the news of Germany's surrender.

The geography of Washington, D.C., even that of the White House, and the biographies of three men-Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Hitler-are more important to Kennedy's story than the world beyond the borders of the United States or, for that matter, than the American people of his subtitle. One of Kennedy's aims is evidently to urge upon Americans a greater attention to and sense of responsibility in the larger world, yet with the exception of the excellent discussion of the differing explanations of the economic crisis offered by Herbert Hoover and Roosevelt, there is surprisingly little incorporation of inter- national elements into the dynamic of the story. For all the importance of the larger world, for Kennedy, as for many Americans, whether professional historians or not, the international is a sort of "other," something "over there," if I may reverse the title of one of Kennedy's earlier books.62 Kennedy- also pays little attention to social history, not even to social histories that have sought to better explain the politics of the interwar years.63 Nor does the book address intellectual history, the history of science and technology (except briefly in connection with war production), the states, education, urban history, and much more. In fact, the book would have been more accurately described by the title of William E. Leuchtenburg's classic, F.D.R. and the New Deal, 1932-1940, which is here superseded and extended into the war years.64 So titled, adding the war to the New Deal, one could have no objection to this extraordinarily well-written, deeply researched, and compellingly argued book. But is it a history of "the American people"? Freedom from Fear is a masterful narrative on the terms it has assumed for itself. Yet having said that, historiographical questions remain. Kennedy apparently assumes that three voices are the important ones; not many other voices are heard, even though each of a small clutch of additional figures is presented very effectively as a full human being: Lorena Hickok, Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, Raymond Moley, Herbert Hoover, John L. Lewis, and A. Philip Randolph, among a few others. History for Kennedy, unlike for the other authors of these syntheses, is made by select leaders, not by ordinary people. What is remarkable, therefore, is the illusion of synthesis that is achieved. The book was published in a series that promises narrative syntheses of the defining periods of American national history. Most so far published accept traditional definitions of periods, and they are framed as political history, but none is so severely restricted as this one, which won the Pulitzer Prize in part because it was recognized as a work of grand synthesis. Dramatic changes in the historiography of the American field make it seem anachronistic. Yet its success makes the point that political history in the grand [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 62 David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (New York, 1980).

Fred Anderson's Crucible of War again engages us with the question of elites and ordinary people, and it provides -a promising approach. While Kennedy seems quite confident of the importance of a few leaders, Anderson seems to be ambivalent, and that ambivalence enriches his history. Although I think the principal contribution of Crucible of War to our understanding of the British Empire is grounded in the social history of the political and military experience of ordinary Americans, the dramatic focus, as with Francis Parkman's great nineteenth-century narrative, is on two great leaders of the French and Indian War, the marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe.65 Yet, as Alan Taylor has insightfully insisted, Anderson has rewritten the story of their confrontation in a way that diminishes these actors, especially Wolfe.66 To be sure, Anderson's book goes beyond Parkman in its respect for Native Americans, their agency, and their role in the empire (and the role of the empire and war for them). He also modifies Parkman on a point that is central to the book's contribution to imperial history: unlike Parkman, Anderson not only notices but makes much of the division between English colonials and English metropolitans. These differences in expectation and experience make the war in his view a "theatre of intercultural interaction."67 Like Butler, Anderson seeks to diminish the role of 1776 in understanding the development of what became the United States. Historians, he argues, will better understand the creation of the United States by closely examining the Seven Years' War and, more generally, by challenging the usual tendency to "take as our point of reference the thirteen rebelling colonies, not the empire as a whole."68 Yet, even as he argues the importance of getting behind the Revolution of 1776 so that one can discover the eighteenth century as it was experienced, the revolution remains a touchstone for him. More than anything else, he wants the reader to recognize that the shots fired in the Seven Years' War were the ones with implications around the world. But he keeps de-historicizing his story to use it to diminish the shot of lesser implication (in his view) heard 'round the world in 1775. When one begins the book, there is a sense of excitement. Here is a history of the United States ready to take the globe as its context. Before the narrative even begins, the reader is presented with a portfolio of maps. Only two of eight describe the British colonies; no more than four of them consider North America at all. The portfolio begins with a world map, revealing the global distribution of the battles that marked the Seven Years' War. There are also maps of the Indian subcontinent, Central Europe, and the Caribbean. The introduction promises a book that will make the world, or at least the full extent of the British Empire, its context and subject. We are told that "if viewed from Montreal or Vincennes, St. Augustine, Havana, Paris or Madrid-or, for that matter Calcutta or Berlin-the Seven Years' War was far more significant than the War of American Independence."69 [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 65 Francis Parkman, Montcalm and Wolfe, 6th edn., 2 vols.

We get very little of Asia (although Manila makes a brief but important comparative appearance), the Caribbean, Africa, and continental Europe. Of course, other European powers are part of the narrative, but they only have walk-on roles. We learn little of them at home or about the ways leaders or ordinary citizens interpret events, while we are, by contrast, led through elaborate accounts of high British politics. The preface, presumably written last, sketches an extraordinary agenda for what would be a stunning book. Unfortunately, Anderson did not write the book he there described. Still, judged in terms of what it did rather than what it proposed to do, it is an outstanding work of craft. It will no doubt be our generation's account of the Seven Years' War. As military history, it is superb, and it contributes importantly-but not so grandly as some of the opening rhetoric promises-to the non-controversial but still unclear issue of the causal relations that connect the Seven Years' War to the coming of the revolution. Anderson in fact offers a rich Anglo-centric narrative that explores and explains the different meaning of the war both as strategic event and as experience for the British of the metropole and in the colonies. It is written with verve and confidence-and a seemingly complete command of the materials, primary and secondary. One of its themes is the misperception of events by political elites; with the exception of William Pitt, surely Anderson's hero in this story, they fail to understand the different meaning of the war and empire for ordinary soldiers and colonial subjects. He thus makes cultural issues the heart of the book. Military and political elites play a dramatic role in the narrative, but causation for Anderson- and here he points to important newer developments in military and diplomatic history-is to be found in the culture of everyday life.70 In making this point, he not only offers an important interpretation of the war (building in part on his previous book on Massachusetts soldiers), he also reveals the empire to be less solid, more a matter of continuous negotiation, than historians often consider such entities, whether empires or nations or states.71 MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN ANDERSON, Ira Berlin, referring to the earliest history of Afro-European North America, and Daniel T. Rodgers, addressing the early twentieth century, incorporate the Atlantic, or at least the North Atlantic, into their narratives of American history. Berlin and Rodgers write very different kinds of history and focus on different periods. Berlin's is a social history, while Rodgers has written an intellectual history, or, perhaps, a history of political culture. Yet both Berlin and Rodgers recognize the complex webs that route movements-of people, of ideas, of money, of things-in the Atlantic world. The transnational terrains that Berlin and Rodgers evoke establish larger and truer frames for national histories than do notions of bounded and self-contained regions or nations. The first section of Berlin's Many Thousands Gone, a portrait of the Atlantic littoral, describes a world framed by cities and the sea, little divided by national [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 70 Anderson, Crucible of War, 453-54. 71 See Fred Anderson, A Peoples' Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the Seven Years' War (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1984).

Berlin's opening tableau describes the emergence of the Atlantic world as an ever- expanding historical terrain, where the African presence is pervasive on the sea and in the cities, including Lisbon, where they made up 10 percent of the population in the sixteenth century. He evokes a world defined by a network of cosmopolitan cities populated by creolized peoples. African people were not only omnipresent, they were often crucial cultural and economic brokers, helping to knit this new world together. Berlin lets go of this powerful frame and image in his later chapters, where he narrows the focus to regional difference within the bounds of British North America. Still, the book's protean beginning remains in the reader's mind, inviting others to realize its narrative logic and moral meaning.72 In Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (1998), Daniel T. Rodgers also achieves a richer historicism by expanding the space of analysis. One small indication is in the subtitle. He refers to "social politics," not the more usual "welfare state." His approach, examining relations in space as well as over time as fields of contingency, makes the welfare state a problematic common term. When he uses the more general and more mobile term "social politics," he effectively historicizes the concept, lineage, and practice of the welfare state. The development of a social politics has other possible paths and outcomes besides evolution into the national welfare state.73 The national welfare state thus becomes a historically and place-specific invention rather than a universal or, worse, the teleological endpoint of American liberal narratives-an endpoint surely upended by the politics of the last quarter of the twentieth century. Following the pioneering work of James T. Kloppenberg, who also assumed a Euro-American context for progressivism and social democracy, Rodgers ap- proaches this age of reform as at once a transnational and national issue.74 A variety of reforms-from urban planning to social insurance to regulation of capitalism- are examined as products both of general, transnational ideas and of particular, national political cultures. The complex narratives thus developed by Rodgers and Kloppenberg-ones that recognize, especially in the case of Rodgers, the historicity of the balance between national and transnational-are a major advance in the narrative synthesis of a national history. Both Rodgers and Kloppenberg impress on the reader that ideas could cross the Atlantic in either direction. This is salutary; American intellectual history is too often thought by Europeans and Americans as well to be either insignificant or derivative, not quite up to equal participation in an international world of ideas. This common point is handled differently in each book. While Kloppenberg notes [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 72 One hopes this extension of the historiographical terrain will continue and that connections as well as comparisons will be made between the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic and between the Atlantic slave trade and the slave trade that turned to the east, to the Muslim empires of the Mediterranean and today's Middle East. Big as it is, the Atlantic does not capture the logic and dimensions of slavery in this era. 73 See, for example, the argument (somewhat dependent on Rodgers's work) in Thomas Bender, "Cities, Intellectuals, and Citizenship in the United States: The 1890s and 1990s," Citizenship Studies 3 (1999): 203-20. 74 Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age (Cambridge, Mass., 1998); James T. Kloppenberg, Uncertain Victory: Social Democracy and Progressivism in European and American Thought, 1870-1920 (New York, 1986).

Rodgers, by contrast, focuses on the specific transit of ideas and emphasizes the way intellectuals and reformers on either side of the Atlantic drew selectively on these ideas, depending on personal taste and local circumstance. The result is a fundamental and valuable reorientation of the way we might understand intellectual history. The conceptual opening they have created invites a yet more radical under- standing of the territory and movement of ideas. Let me go back to the title of Rodgers's book. I think that "Atlantic Crossings" projects too narrow an under- standing of the implications of the book. It emphasizes the movement of people and ideas back and forth across the Atlantic. To that extent, it recalls a much older Anglo-American historiography of "trans-Atlantic influences."75 Rodgers goes well beyond this historiography in showing that, in important respects, Europe was partly Americanized and the United States was partly Europeanized by the phenomena he describes. But his really important accomplishment is to get away from the "influence" model, to displace the linear A to B notion of intellectual history. But he could have gone farther yet. There is more to the circulation of ideas than this framing recognizes. It is more than an Atlantic crossing, more than a link between Western Europe and the United States. The whole Atlantic, South Atlantic as well as North Atlantic, and, indeed, increasingly, parts of the Pacific world better describe the extent of the intellectual network his book evokes. In regard to urban development and reform, an important theme in Rodgers's book, it is clear that there is a global conversation at work. Rather than the linearity of steamship crossings (the dustjacket illustration) between the port cities of Western Europe and New York, I imagine a Great Bazaar of urban ideas, technology, and aesthetics hovering over the Atlantic, with many traders and buyers. This exchange is not, of course, symmetrical, and that itself is an issue, but participation was nearly global in 1900. Progressive ideas, especially those dealing with urban reform and technologies, traveled through many circuits and with different voltage, but nearly the whole world was connected, not only Western Europe and the United States. Simply look at the cities of Eastern Europe, Latin America, parts of Africa, Central and East Asia. Surely, they were part of an international conception of urbanism-and of urban commercial culture. The remnants of the era make it clear that New York and Chicago, no less than Lyons, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Shanghai, were local instances of a global process of city-making. THESE LAST COMMENTS SUGGEST what I take to be the next challenge of narrative synthesis. But before I conclude, let me briefly review what has been accomplished by the cohort of synthetic histories considered here. These books reveal, even verify, the capacity of narrative synthesis to achieve inclusion and to respect issues of identity. Moreover, it seems possible in synthetic narratives to combine structure [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 75 See Frank Thistlethwaite, The Anglo-American Connection in the Early Nineteenth Century (Philadelphia, 1959).

The volumes here examined reveal many narrative strategies and quite different relations to a wider reading public. There is no single model, and no one volume (yet) does all the things we might fairly expect in a realized synthesis. In addition, these books, both in what they do and do not do, suggest to me the value of embracing a narrative core that is a more explicit and deeper exploration of democracy and difference, freedom and empowerment, contest and justice. Such a focus promises a sharper analytical history, one more historical and less susceptible to teleology, whether of modernity or anything else. It seems plausible to propose that a wider canvas, a supranational context, may in fact enhance the examination of these issues. The work of Hine and Faragher, Berlin, Gordon, and Rodgers in particular enables one to imagine an even more radical synthesis of national history, one that operates on multiple geographical scales, from narratives smaller than the nation to supra-national ones-thus identifying the nation as a product of history as well as an object of historical inquiry. Such a framing of national history will increase awareness of the complexity of the multiple axes of historical interaction, causation, and identity formation. While I mean these concluding comments to suggest an ambitious new agenda for the discipline, we must not overlook an already existing and compelling example. Decades ago, David Brion Davis embarked on a multivolume history that considered all these issues. He brought them together in his majestic synthesis that explores slavery and freedom in the Atlantic world, a history of nearly global reach that is also-and I emphasize this fact-a history of the United States.76 My point, then, is that such histories can be written, have been written, and I trust that more will yet be written. The present moment seems especially propitious for such histories. The relation of the nation to both subnational and transnational solidarities is very much in question. It is a public concern as well as an object of interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry. Historians surely have an open invitation to rethink the boundaries of national histories.77 Colonial historians have been moving in this direction for some time, redefining their field as the Atlantic world long before the globalization talk. Likewise, Rodgers and Ian Tyrrell, both of whom work on the modern period, moved in this direction fairly early and for a different reason: their concern about the claims of American exceptionalism.78 With these various concerns at work, we may fairly expect a movement of American historians and other historians as well toward a wider sense of their fields. National histories will not be so firmly bounded, and the assumption of their national autarky will be softened by the recognition that national histories are [[END 02P0009T]] [[START 02P0009T]] 76 David Brion Davis, The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture (Ithaca, N.Y., 1966); The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823 (Ithaca, 1975), with the final installment yet to come. 77 See Bender, Rethinking American History in a Global Age; and Thomas Bender, The La Pietra Report (Bloomington, Ind., 2000), also available on the World Wide Web at www.oah.org/activities/ lapietra/index.html. 78 Ian Tyrrell, "American Exceptionalism in an Age of International History," AHR 96 (October 1991): 1031-55; Daniel T.

Abstract: [[START 03X0760F]] Review Essays Word Made Flesh: Christianity, Modernity, and Cultural Colonialism in the Work of Jean and John Comaroff ELIZABETH ELBOURNE "IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us," as the first chapter of the Book of John proclaims in a text often read at Christian Easter celebrations. The text might be taken as a something of a leitmotif of the first two volumes (of a projected three) of Jean and John Comaroff's brilliant and rightly influential series, Of Revelation and Revolution.1 The first two volumes, Christianity, Colonialism, and Consciousness in South Africa and The Dialectics of Modernity on a South African Frontier, explore the nineteenth-century encounter between British Protestant Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana in a region that is now in the northern part of the Republic of South Africa. The Comaroffs attempt, however, to do far more than merely describe a series of relatively small-scale historical events. They are interested in missionaries above all because of their complex relationship to "modernity," which the Comaroffs see in turn as tightly linked to a particular phase of European colonialism. The title of the second volume, "The Dialectics of Modernity," suggests as much. Most European missionaries tried hard to function as agents of cultural change-of "civilization" in early nineteenth-century missionaries' own terms, implicitly casting the Tswana as "savage" and thereby laying out one of the key dialectical oppositions of colonial- ism, which would function as a justification for dispossession. Some Tswana interlocutors adapted some elements of "Christian behavior," the Comaroffs argue, but many others demonstrated resistance to the hegemony of British colonialism in part by resisting the colonization of their everyday lives. The nineteenth-century Protestant project to remake the world, of which the Nonconformist missionaries of southern Africa were important proponents, is thus linked by the Comaroffs forward to colonialism and to contemporary globalization, and backward in time to Part of this article was presented in a much earlier version at the Twentieth Anniversary Conference of the Journal of Southern African Studies, York, 1994; I would like to thank the participants as well as those who subsequently commented helpfully, including David Maxwell, Norman Etherington, Ed Wilmsen, and Paul Landau.

Missionaries were, in effect, agents of a first wave of globalization. The missionary movement was an early exemplar of a transnational global movement, while the intellectual claims of missionaries to universality paralleled the modernist claims of a globalizing colonialism. The struggles over the texture and composition of everyday life that took place on the frontiers of colonial society in nineteenth-century southern Africa therefore tell us something not only about the nature of colonialism but also about modernity and its considerable discontents, as well as about the resistance of the colonized to the European colonial project. In this sense, a quest for origins informs the narrative structure of both books.2 Indeed, one of the reasons that this seminal text engages us so closely is its concern with the narrative of dispossession and resistance, with a beginning and therefore, implicitly, some hope for an end-an only ambivalently postmodern narrative, in fact, despite some alarm in southern Africanist circles over Of Revelation and Revolution as a postmodern nail in the coffin of materialist history.3 This focus lends moral urgency to the Comaroffs' consideration of the distant initial encounters between white missionaries and the southern Tswana in the early nineteenth century. Volume 2, for example, opens with a striking vignette: Tswana soldiers refuse to defend the white regime in 1994, as Afrikaner patriots launch a last-ditch raid on Bophuthatswana. As homeland structures crumble around them as they write, the Comaroffs acknowledge that endings and beginnings are never entirely neat. "And yet in many respects, the narrative of Tswana colonization had completed itself, finally running its course from Revelation to Revolution."4 Doubtless the authors would now adopt a less utopian position, but their enthusiasm for revolution and for endings is important, and typical of South African historical writing from the decades before the end of apartheid.5 2 Catherine Desbarats, "Essais sur quelques elements de l'6criture de l'histoire am6rindienne," Revue d'histoire de l'Ameriquefranqaise 53, no. 4 (Spring 2000): 491-520, provides an interesting model, inspired among others by Paul Ricoeur, Hayden White, and Kerwin Lee Klein, for the reading of various historical approaches to the colonial encounter as forms of narrative romance, given the inescapable narrativity of the historical text. Susan Newton-King, also drawing on Ricoeur, similarly reflects on the inescapable imposition of an artificial order on colonial encounters by the historian of colonialism.

These authors take a variety of positions on the issues of whether or not the Comaroffs are postmodern and whether or not the rise of postmodernism in post-apartheid South African academic historical scholarship has been a positive development in a field that was previously (and in many ways still is) passionately materialist in approach. 4 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: xiii. 5 The original title of the series was reportedly From Revelation to Revolution, planned at a time before the release of Nelson Mandela. In a recent conversation with Homi Bhabha, however, John Comaroff is considerably less sanguine about the end of apartheid in South Africa and popular enthusiasm for Mandela outside South Africa, which he sees as a last gasp of modernist optimism in AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 436 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh In a similar vein, at the heart of Volume 1 is a crucial chapter, "Through the Looking Glass: Heroic Journeys, First Encounters." This chapter sets out to explore "the initial meeting of two worlds, one imperial and expansive, the other local and defensive."6 In marvelously evocative detail, the authors describe the initial entry of envoys of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1816 into the Tswana capital, Dithakong (seen by the missionaries themselves as a sacred journey into the land of Satan), a subsequent meeting, and the complex negotiations that took place throughout over the terms of the mission. A key metaphor is furnished by the mirror that the LMS envoy John Campbell presented as a gift to the Tswana chief, Mothibi, symbolizing the Western effort to reconfigure Tswana consciousness and the Tswana notion of the self. These initial encounters prefigured the colonial encounter to come: "the square enclosure and all that 'took place' at the center of the most public of Tswana spaces was ominous, foreshadowing a methodical reconstruction of their symbolic map."7 The Christian missionary project, this chapter further suggests, was from the start central to the creation of the dialectical oppositions of colonialism, ironic in view of its claim to erase difference. For the Comaroffs, the colonization of the Tswana thus began (although it certainly did not end) with the word, in the sense both of Bible and of cultural text, with the advent of white Protestant missionaries and their claims to possess the revealed divine word-albeit a word made flesh, clothed in material power. The roots of colonization were in a series of knowledge claims and a set of hegemonic cultural discourses, which would bolster the later seizure of land and of labor. Many scholars have explored the linkage between knowledge claims and colonial power, an issue that has long lain at the heart of postcolonial scholarship and that occupies an increasingly central place in the study of imperialism from a diversity of perspectives.8 Nonetheless, Of Revelation and Revolution furnishes a particularly influential and important statement of the position, in part because it provides a great deal of flesh on the bones of a theoretical model of cultural colonialism. The work moves from the field of discourse alone to examine in great detail concrete material struggles over the remaking of everyday life, including Tswana efforts to resist cultural colonialism. More controversially, perhaps, Of Revelation and Revolution also attempts to make explicit the links in southern Africa between a postcolonial setting.

AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 437 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Elizabeth Elbourne political, economic, and cultural colonialism-fields the authors argue are in any case impossible to disaggregate.9 The programmatic claims that lend Of Revelation and Revolution its force also, however, cause some interesting tensions in the book. The need to make linkages and the Comaroffs' explicit commitment to the exploration of large-scale processes lead the authors to oversimplify in places. Not only that, but the imperatives of a dialectical method push the Comaroffs at times (despite their parallel stress on indeterminacy and their very explicit engagement with the costs and benefits of a dialectical analysis, especially in Volume 2) into tighter methodological corners than they might themselves like. The links between early nineteenth-century cultural colonialism and late nineteenth-century political colonialism are not as direct or as ontologically indissoluble as the Comaroffs assume they are, while the relationship of "modernity" to colonialism furnishes matter for debate, with considerable contemporary implications. The very boldness of the Comaroffs' arguments has indeed contributed to a mixed reception among scholars of southern African history and of religion in Africa, with some enthusiastically welcoming the methodological innovation of the Comaroffs and others casting doubt in a number of ways. In the second volume of the series, the Comaroffs seem to me to have backed down somewhat from some of their bolder claims, despite their spirited engagement with the critics. This in itself provides an interesting case study of the evolution of ideas during a turbulent decade in South African history. In what follows, I would like to engage with this important work in several ways. First, I want to lay out my understanding of the theoretical guidelines in the opening volume, with particular attention to the issue of hegemony and power. Second, I want to provide an alternate reading of the opening encounters between Tswana and missionary, focusing on other intermediaries and on the fact that, even before the advent of European missionaries, the region was already affected by colonialism. I shall use this example to ask whether a dialectic model does not in some ways oversimplify complicated situations and make it hard to account for fudging across the fault lines. I shall further ask whether the result is not a rather muted account of individual agency and an attenuated depiction of the multiple uses of mission Christianity, both as language and as practice. This is not, however, to deny the latent authoritarian potential of much missionary activity, particularly in a colonial context. Third, I also want to gesture, albeit sketchily, toward some issues associated with narrative and chronology, suggesting that the schematic narrative about "modernity," industrialization, and globalization that undergirds both volumes, though provocative and important, also offers a number of hostages to fortune. These include an undue stress on the capacity of missionaries to induct converts into the global economy by changing their consciousness; rather, I see converts struggling to adapt to an overpowering global economy, among other things by trying to use Christianity in a variety of ways, with greater or lesser degrees of success. Having said all that, does this fact-mongering matter?-What are the Comaroffs doing that might go beyond reading the content of particular 9 Colonialism was simultaneously a "process in political economy and culture," and these dimensions were "indissoluble aspects of the same reality, whose fragmentation into discrete spheres hides their ontological unity."

Throughout, I want to take up some concerns of African historians and anthropologists with questions of narrative, voice, and agency in Of Revelation and Revolution. THE INITIAL CHAPTER OF THE FIRST VOLUME is a careful theoretical exposition. Although the authors rather cheerfully direct those with little stomach for theoretical discussions to skip theirs and, en bon bricoleur, to pick up the narrative at a later point, the opening discussion of anthropological concepts is in fact crucial for an understanding of what both this book and its later companion seek to accomplish. I would accordingly like to pause upon it. The stated goal of the work is to present an anthropology of the "colonial encounter," in this case between British Nonconformist missionaries and the southern Tswana, with the larger implication that the missionaries acted as the cultural arm of colonialism, while the dilemmas of the Tswana in their confrontations with colonialism mirrored, if they obviously did not precisely reproduce, the experience of other colonized African groups in South Africa. The Comaroffs state that they hope that their discussion of this particular mission will accomplish three other things: to anticipate later modes of consciousness and struggle in South Africa; to look at an example of historical processes that were happening across Africa and indeed much of the non-Western world; and to examine analytic issues to do with the "nature of power and resistance." With reference to this latter objective: How, precisely, were structures of inequality fashioned during the colonial encounter, often in the absence of more conventional, more coercive tools of domination? How was consciousness made and remade in this process? ... How were new hegemonies established and the "ground prepared," in [Antonio] Gramsci's phrase, for formal European political control? ... Even more fundamentally, how are we to understand the dialectics of culture and power, ideology and consciousness that shape such historical processes?'1 From the vantage point of 1991, the Comaroffs placed their project into a historiographical framework that has since changed considerably, in no small part due to their own work."1 At the time, the Comaroffs castigated anthropologists for 10 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 6. 11 Among many possibilities, some works of particular importance to southern Africa include Paul Stuart Landau, The Realm of the Word: Language, Gender and Christianity in a Southern African Kingdom (London, 1995); Henry Bredekamp and Robert Ross, eds., Missions and Christianity in South African History (Johannesburg, 1995); Pier M. Larson, "'Capacities and Modes of Thinking': Intellectual Engagements and Subaltern Hegemony in the Early History of Malagasy Christianity," AHR 102 (October 1997): 969-1002; Richard Elphick and Rodney Davenport, eds., Christianity in South Africa: A Political, Social, and Cultural History (Berkeley, Calif., 1997); and many other works discussed in David Chidester, Judy Tobler, and Darrel Wratten, Christianity in South Africa: An Annotated Bibliography (Westport, Conn., 1997). The sheer diversity of recent approaches to the history of mission Christianity, a growth field, is impossible to capture in a footnote but is suggested by works such as David Maxwell and Ingrid Lawrie, eds., Christianity and the African Imagination: Essays in Honour of Adrian Hastings (Leiden, 2001); Nicholas Thomas, "Colonial Conversions: Difference, Hierarchy and History in Early Twentieth-Century Evangelical Propaganda," in Hall, Cultures of Empire; Susan Thorne, Congregational Missions and the Making of an Imperial Culture in Nineteenth- Century England (Stanford, Calif., 1999); Peter van der Veer, ed., Conversion to Moderities: The Globalization of Christianity (London, 1996); Robert W.

Historians paid more attention to missions but in the 1960s and 1970s often focused on the theoretically crude question of "whose side were the missionaries really on?" By the 1980s, mission history had been more fruitfully incorporated into work on such long-term processes as colonial conquest, capitalist expansion, state formation, and proletarianization. The methodological innovation of the Comaroffs in the early 1990s was, however, to underscore how much this new approach was itself limited by its "preoccupation with political economy at the expense of culture, symbolism, and ideology."12 They echoed the 1986 claim of Terence Ranger that most of the historiography of early missions to that point had overestimated the political and economic factors in its expansion-in a manner, according to the Comaroffs, stemming ultimately from oppositions between mind and matter at the ontological roots of our social thought.13 In rejecting a narrowly political-economic approach, the authors believed they could better answer the questions of why it was that missionaries succeeded in effecting broad social, political, and economic changes without substantial material resources (a question that, of course, assumes that this was accomplished by missionaries). What was needed, the Comaroffs claimed, was a study of consciousness: of why people articulated belief in certain things, why they took others for granted, how colonialism and consciousness were inextricably intertwined. It is in this sense that missionaries were most clearly colonial agents: they sought to remake the lifeworld of the Tswana, indeed, to colonize their consciousness. They did not necessarily seek directly and simplistically to incorpo- rate the Tswana into an unequal colonial world: they had dreamed instead of a "global democracy of material well-being and moral merit," in the Comaroffs' phrase.14 Nonetheless, their actions contributed to building an empire of inequality. This claim rests on the additional argument that the missionaries were the products of post-Enlightenment modernity, creations and agents of rationalization in the Weberian sense. Similarly, Tswana interlocutors made a variety of unexpected uses of the evangelical message, and of evangelical attempts to remake their world, again with unpredictable results. In sum, the encounter between colonial evangelism and the southern Tswana can best be described as a "long conversation," a continuing process in the course of which "signifiers were set afloat, fought over, and recaptured on both sides of the colonial encounter."15 Over the course of this conversation, the Tswana came to conceive of themselves as constituting a separate, Translating the Message: The Missionary Impact on Culture (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1989); and V.

The Currents in World Christianity Project, at the University of Cambridge, has also since 1996 lent considerable impetus to the scholarly study of missions. A longstanding African literature reconsiders missions and the truth claims of missionaries, often from a theological perspective: for example, J. N. K. Mugambi, From Liberation to Reconstruction: African Christian Theology after the Cold War (Nairobi, 1996). Many works by African scholars are less well distributed in the West than they might be, given material constraints. From a wide variety of directions, missionary activity has become a newly invigorated area of research since the 1990s, although some of the more difficult underlying issues are perhaps not adequately discussed in all the literature. 12 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 8. 13 Terence Ranger, "Religious Movements and Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa," African Studies Review 29 (1986): 1-69. 14 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 12. 15 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17-18.

At the same time, the "forms" of the "European worldview" became inscribed on the "African land- scape": "not only did colonialism produce reified cultural orders, it gave rise to a new hegemony amidst-and despite-cultural contestation."16 Throughout this discussion, the Comaroffs reject the poststructuralist claim that all meanings are equally tenuous and open to contestation, regretting the episte- mological hypochondria and consequent intellectual immobility to which postmod- ern critiques have given rise in academia-even as the authors uphold some of the central insights of such critiques, notably their insistence that the indeterminacies of meaning and action be addressed by scholars.17 What poststructuralists cannot address is the basic question of how some meanings get widely accepted over significant periods of time by those against whose interest it is to believe them. This is the problem of hegemony, raised by Gramsci (however sketchy his discussion in the Prison Notebooks) and developed by many social theorists.18 The Comaroffs offer a solution, though over-schematic in the literal sense of the word. They see human consciousness as existing on a spectrum from "hegemony" to "ideology." At the hegemony end of the spectrum, one finds the taken-for-granted inscribed in everyday life-those beliefs that are not questioned because they are not even noticed as beliefs. At the other end, one finds articulated ideology, which is available for debate and which often tries to bring into consciousness the hegemonic beliefs of earlier stages. Culture in general is the "space of signifying practice, the semantic ground on which human beings seek to construct and represent themselves and others-and hence, society and history."l9 Somewhat oddly, hegemonic concepts are described as "constructs and conventions that have come to be shared and naturalized through a political community," while ideology is "the expression and ultimately the possession of a particular social group, although it may be widely peddled beyond."20 This psychological structure seems artificial and unwieldy; it is unclear why the province of the hegemonic idea should be the political community (a tricky concept to define in any case), while ideology is described not only as the product of communities (rather than at least sometimes of individuals) but as the province of the social rather than, say, political or even self-consciously intellectual groupings. The definition of the political is murky here, as it is throughout the book, despite (even sometimes because of) the painstaking effort of the authors to demonstrate the deeply political nature of the everyday stuff of life; what is lacking here and elsewhere is a willingness to limit and define the nature of the political in such a manner as to make it meaningful to call something political in the first place. Be that as it may, this construction of group political psychology permits the Comaroffs to draw conclusions that are critically important for their overall project. Indeed, the reconstruction of struggles over the stuff of everyday life that takes pride of place in the second volume depends ultimately on this theoretical 16 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 18. 17 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 17. 18 Antonio Gramsci, Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci, Quentin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, trans.

Given the place of hegemony and ideology on an ever-changing spectrum, the two are constantly fluid; meanings are always being made and remade, as ideology challenges hegemony to reveal itself, and it is in the inchoate, fluid space between hegemony and ideology that human consciousness is at its most creative. Given that hegemony is constructed largely through the "assertion of control over various modes of symbolic production: over such things as educational and ritual processes, patterns of socialization, political and legal procedures, canons of style and self-representation, public communication, health and bodily discipline and so on," the realm of "symbolic production" is (presumably) political because it is a site for power struggles. This means both that the "symbolic production" is political and that resistance to modes of symbolic production that generate hegemony is political. Modes of resistance run across as wide a spectrum as modes of control, with at one end organized protest and other movements readily recognized as political by the West; at the other end are "gestures of tacit refusal and iconoclasms, gestures that sullenly and silently contest the forms of an existing hegemony."21 It is thus in this light that missions must be seen. They sought to extend hegemonic control over indigenous peoples by changing their worldviews to a point that new ways of behaving and seeing the world were completely internalized. Resistance to the specific forms of Christianity was also resistance to the message behind the signs. In the purest sense, resistance to Christian forms was resistance to the content of capitalism and to the global capitalist system; this is indeed a critical plank of Jean Comaroff's fascinating (if not uncontroversial) reading of African independent churches as quintessentially subversive because they appropriated and yet subverted Christian forms, in her important 1985 study Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance.22 Christian missions must also be re-read. Their gestures and ritual must be analyzed in order to see how missionaries were attempting to change far more than religious allegiance, acting as emissaries of modernity and economic transfor- mation. Finally, conversion was inextricably political, and as such a suitable site for political competition between colonizers and the colonized. The extremely rich remainder of this book and its successor volume work out the implications of these theoretical positions through a quite brilliant analysis of the nineteenth-century "colonial exchange" between the southern Tswana and the Nonconformist missions to them run first by the London Missionary Society (pioneers in the field) and then by their later-arriving brethren, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. An additional important project of the authors throughout this study is to demonstrate the importance of an imagined Africa to the British sense of themselves and more broadly to the construction of modernity. As the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2, as part of a series of seven propositions about colonialism, "colonialism was as much involved in making the metropole, and the identities and ideologies of colonizers, as it was in (re)making peripheries and colonial sub- 21 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 31. 22 Jean Comaroff, Body of Power, Spirit of Resistance: The Culture and History of a South African People (Chicago, 1985).

A final critical point is that the authors see the interaction between missionary and Tswana as a form of dialectic between two key groups of interlocutors, dependent on the notion of difference. In the second volume, the Comaroffs acknowledge with more force than in Volume 1 the existence of overlap on the ground, and they reemphasize that the idea of difference was created by the dialectical process, despite some merging of lifeways on the ground and the mutual influence of Tswana and British. Note their comment that "neither 'the colonizer' nor 'the colonized' represented an undifferentiated sociological or political reality, save in exceptional circumstances."25 Since the end product of the colonial encounter was so clearly the production of difference and a series of deeply embedded dialectical oppositions, the Comaroffs nonetheless argue that this is the most productive optic through which to view the early nineteenth-century encounter between European mission- aries and Africans. This model is furthermore essential to their theoretical account of the formation of hegemony. ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE FOUND MOST PERPLEXING about the work of the Comaroffs is, nevertheless, the question of the extent to which it is appropriate to describe the Tswana encounter with Christianity as a form of dialectic. This question implies the ancillary question of who the agents of the dialectic were at given moments. On the face of it, these are tendentious concerns, since colonialism was so clearly in many ways a dialectic between colonized and colonizer, just as colonialism clearly generated reified views of colonizer and colonized alike. Missionaries themselves usually understood their activities in dialectical terms. Yet I think one can ask whether a dialectical approach to the history of Christianity in colonial contexts 23 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 22. 24 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 86. Those influenced by the Comaroffs in this respect include David Chidester, Savage Systems: Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa (Charlottesville, Va., 1996); Leon de Kock, Civilising Barbarians: Missionary Narrative and African Textual Response in Nineteenth-Century South Africa (Johannesburg, 1996); Doug Stuart, "'Of Savages and Heroes': Discourses of Race, Nation and Gender in the Evangelical Missions to Southern Africa in the Early Nineteenth Century" (PhD dissertation, Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London, 1994).

This is above all because of the rapidity with which Christianity was out of the hands of the missionaries and settlers who brought it, the corresponding importance of non- Europeans in the spread of Christianity, the multiplicity of uses to which diverse interest groups of all ethnicities put Christianity as both a language and a practice, and the political and cultural complications of regions with multiple power players. These issues are brought out by a re-reading of the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana that occupy so key a role in the first volume of Of Revelation and Revolution. I should add that I made similar comments about the opening phases of the mission in an unpublished conference paper after the publication of Volume 1. The Comaroffs respond generously to this paper in Volume 2, as they do to a number of other critics, using the occasion to clarify and amplify their understanding of a dialectical approach. I do not want to beat a dead horse. Nonetheless, I think there are some useful differences of interpretation at stake, and so will abuse the Comaroffs' patience by briefly recapitulating a potential alternate reading of these opening gambits, before returning to the wider issue of different approaches to mission history.26 Let me first make a comment about regional issues. The lands of the southern Tswana were disrupted by colonialism, drought, hunger, and regional conflict well before the formal advent of missions. Furthermore, as Johannes du Bruyn has underscored, the lands inhabited by the southern Tswana were so profoundly affected by the Cape Colony to the south that it is problematic to frame a discussion of cultural colonialism primarily in terms of Europe and the Transvaal. In particular, the colonial firearms frontier moved with great speed, was highly destructive, and was arguably more important earlier than the Comaroffs suggest. Many different armed bands, some of them ethnically mixed, decimated peaceful groups in conflict situations exacerbated by hunger.27 Arguments about the regional context for evangelical missions to the Tswana are also implicit in a much wider body of literature about the so-called mfecane (or difaqane)-terms that have been much disputed by historians. Traditionally, the mfecane was a term given to the widespread wars, famines, and refugee movements that shook (and temporarily depopulated) much of the interior of southern Africa in the early nineteenth century, the impact of which on the Tswana the Comaroffs date from 1822. There is no space here to explore that debate, although it will be helpful to know that a 26 My re-reading of the opening encounter is based on my own work on LMS archives, which I consulted primarily with the aim of writing about contestation over the uses of Christianity within the Cape Colony and with a focus on Khoesan not Tswana uses of Christianity. It seems to me fruitful, however, to unite diverse perspectives on a very complex subject. Elizabeth Elbourne, Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (Montreal, 2002). There were four LMS delegations to the Tswana to establish a mission, not two as the Comaroffs have it. 27 Johannes du Bruyn, "Of Muffled Tswana and Overwhelming Missionaries: The Comaroffs and the Colonial Encounter," South African Historical Journal, no. 31 (1994): 294-309; Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 1: 275-76. On Tswana views of the firearms frontier, see Robert Moffat to Richard Miles, Lattakoo [Kuruman], December 5, 1827, in Isaac Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman: Being the Journals and Letters of Robert and Mary Moffat, 1820-1828 (London, 1951), 274. Other letters in this collection describe frequent deadly raids throughout the 1820s, in which a wide variety of often ethnically mixed groups preyed on one another. On Cape influence, see also Johannes du Bruyn, "James Read en die Thlaping, 1816-1820," Historia 35 (1990). AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 444 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]] [[START 03X0760F]] Word Made Flesh critical issue is whether or not covert slave trading from the Cape Colony and Portuguese territories was at the root of disruptions that have more traditionally been ascribed to the many conquests of the Zulu kingdom in the region of what is now Natal. The point I want to emphasize here is not only the great disruption in the region but also the plausibility of historian Neil Parsons's argument that Tswana territory had already been subject since the seventeenth century to political unrest and the large-scale movement of populations. Parsons in fact suggests that the roots of disruption and state formation in the area may well lie in destabilization that considerably antedated the 1820s and may in turn be linked in at least some way to eighteenth-century slave trading to the north and the rise of the predatory Cape Colony to the south.28 Scholars also tend to see later Afrikaner settler colonialism in the region as part of the same broad processes. All this calls into question the determinative impact of mission Christianity in an already destabilized region. Maybe political colonialism did precede cultural colonialism after all? How might we need to reconceptualize the Christian/Tswana encounter if we think of it as taking place in some sense in a frontier zone, or even a borderland, with multiple players, already characterized by cultural admixture, politically influenced uses of Christianity, and political turbulence? The Comaroffs are of course sensitive to these hugely important issues. I think nonetheless that they could emphasize regional complexity more and the power of missionary Christianity somewhat less in their discussion of the roots of material change (at both ends of the nineteenth century), as well as pay more attention to the implications for their overall theoretical argument of the fact that Africans tried to experiment in response to very difficult local conditions. It is also important that the missionaries entered as potential power brokers in a turbulent environment but were initially weak, able to manipulate power if and only if they could make the right alliances. With these types of broad issues in mind, the opening encounters between missionaries and Tswana, so well described by the Comaroffs, might be re-read as conversations between a number of actors. Four LMS delegations traveled between 1813 and 1817 to the southern Tswana settlement known to the missionaries as Lattakoo (later Dithakong) to try to persuade the Tswana to accept missionaries. It is perhaps symbolically appropriate that none of these delegations was exclusively white. In addition to the delegations' African members, even the missionaries themselves included a black West Indian man and a Welsh speaker. Neither, come to that, was the Tswana polity entirely "Tswana." The Thlaping polity was relatively multi-ethnic; the chief Mothibi, for example, was half !Kora (a Khoekhoe-speaking group) and (like others of the chiefly lineage) married a !Kora woman. More significantly, the Europeans were not the only, or even the most important, players promoting an evangelical mission. Key from a Tswana perspective were regional actors, the Griqua (as they 28 Julian Cobbing, "The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo," Journal of African History 29, no. 3 (1988): 487-519; Caroline Hamilton, ed., Mfecane Aftermath (Johannesburg, 1996), including Neil Parsons, "Prelude to Difaqane in the Interior of Southern Africa c. 1600-1822," 323-49; Neil Parsons, "Kicking the Hornets' Nest: A Third View of the Cobbing Controversy on the Mfecane/Difaqane," address to the University of Botswana History Society, Gabarone, Botswana, March 16, 1999 (available online through the University of Botswana History Department web page, at http://ubh.tripod.com/ub/np.htm).

The Griqua were clusters of settlers in the region of Khoekhoe descent, some of whom had white fathers and Khoesan mothers, and many of whom had migrated from the Cape Colony, epitomizing the remaking of identity in the wake of colonialism. Groups spearheaded by Griqua had established regional hegemony through their access to arms and horses. They provided important trade links with the Cape Colony and were sources of trade goods for the Tswana. The Griqua were already using Christianity in a variety of complicated ways, as a token of equality with white settlers, as justification for what Robert Ross has termed "sub-imperialism" with regard to the unconverted Tswana, and indeed as a basis for their reconstituted polities. Alliances with missionaries gave these emergent polities potential access to diplomacy and markets, including the arms trade, in addition to spiritual concerns. Indeed, on the way to Mothibi's settlement, British LMS inspector Campbell had helped compose a formal written constitution for a Griqua group, reflecting the symbolic uses of the language of law. The language of Christianity was already on the loose in the interior, in other words, and subject to interpretation in Griqualand as much as in the seminaries of Europe.29 The (Khoekhoe) !Kora had also been exposed to Christianity and were also competing by the 1820s to obtain guns and horses from the Cape Colony. The decision of Mothibi and his counselors about whether to accept an LMS mission was thus complicated by the fact that the LMS came under the protection of the powerful Griqua Kok clan. During a second LMS delegation to the Tswana (overlooked by the Comaroffs), for example, Adam Kok presented newly arrived missionaries to Mothibi and acted as their translator. Mothibi was anxious not to offend the powerful Kok family, but worried because his own people had since turned against the mission. In fact, he eventually sent these missionaries away altogether. When two missionaries told Mothibi that one of them "wrought in wood, and one that was to come wrought in Iron, that we would do all the work for him in that way that he wanted," Mothibi was pleased and told Kok "he could not think of rejecting those that came with or through the medium of him." When the missionaries pursued the issue of teaching, however, Mothibi worriedly told Kok that "he would not be instructed, and if A. Kok should endeavour to press it sharply upon him, and his refusal cause a variance between them, he said that he would rather take the flight from Lattakoo, with people." Kok had to reassure Mothibi that the Griqua leader would not force the Tswana chief to relocate if the Thlaping 29 This discussion both here and below draws on Robert Ross, Adam Kok's Griquas: A Study in the Development of Stratification in South Africa (Cambridge, 1976); Elizabeth Elbourne and Robert Ross, "Combating Spiritual and Social Bondage: Early Missions in the Cape Colony," in Elphick and Davenport, Christianity in South Africa; Alan Barnard, Hunters and Herders of Southern Africa: A Comparative Ethnography of the Khoisan Peoples (Cambridge, 1992), 156-75, 193-94; Martin Legassick, "The Northern Frontier to c. 1840: The Rise and Decline of the Griqua People," in Richard Elphick and Hermann Giliomee, eds., The Shaping of South African Society, 1652-1840 (Middletown, Conn., 1988), 358-420; Nigel Penn, "The Orange River Frontier Zone, c. 1700-1805," in Andrew B.

If missionaries were initially dependent on Griqua intermediaries, they were also materially dependent for travel and translation on Khoesan hired in the colony. The Khoekhoe and San had long borne the brunt of brutal colonial subjugation and were in many cases more receptive to conversion than groups beyond the Cape Colony. The Comaroffs indeed have a wonderful discussion of the occlusion of such intermediary figures from missionary accounts of putatively solitary heroic jour- neys.31 I would go further than the Comaroffs, however, and suggest that at least some of these companions saw themselves as fellow missionaries. On the first delegation, Campbell was accompanied by a number of Khoesan Christians from the Cape. Their prayers and preaching had made a pilgrimage route of their journey through a country of which they saw themselves as taking spiritual possession. They were active in trying to persuade Tswana individuals to accept missionaries.32 In 1814, a synod of the southern African LMS missionaries had "set aside" in a religious ceremony several men of Khoesan descent to act as LMS agents in the interior, several of whom, including Griqua leader Andries Waterboer, subse- quently played important roles in the politics of Transorangia. Cupido Kakkerlak, a product of Eastern Cape mission schools whose letters reveal a passionate spirituality, also itinerated in the region, attempting, albeit with little success, to evangelize among the !Kora. These men were employed by the LMS. As the Comaroffs point out, the society would devote much energy to reining in and controlling "native agents" after the earliest years of the mission. Nonetheless, evidence from the Cape suggests that there was also considerable evangelical activity by converts who were not formally paid by missionary societies, including elephant hunters such as Hendrik Boesak or long-range wagon drivers. In addition, as mission stations became more like churches and congregations fought for independence from missionary control around the mid-century mark, congregations had more authority, not less. My point is that evidence from elsewhere in southern Africa suggests that Christianity was spread by people with long-range contacts other than missionaries, presumably not necessarily in orthodox form. The central- ity of Khoesan people (and later other Africans) to European-led missions to the Tswana suggests a wider oral evangelical culture that the written records would not completely reflect.33 Be that as it may, the importance of Khoesan agents to the Tswana mission is most clearly exemplified by the fourth delegation to Lattakoo, led by a former 30 Robert Hamilton to LMS Directors, Griquatown, April 28, 1816, London Missionary Society Papers, South Africa Correspondence-Incoming, 6/3/C, Council for World Mission Archives, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (hereafter, LMS-SA).

Read brought with him an unusually large group of people of varied ethnic origins, mostly Khoesan, including, more problematically, his own Khoekhoe wife, Elizabeth Valentyn, and his pregnant former mistress, a San woman, Sabina Pretorius, whom he claimed to have met by accident on the road. At least ten Khoesan men and six Khoesan women accompanied Read, all of whom were church members and some of whom were "zealous persons."34 It is indeed possible that the Khoesan of the Cape Colony saw this as a Khoesan mission to the Tswana, brokered by their kin among the Griqua. In any case, once Robert Moffat took over the Lattakoo station in 1821 from Read (disgraced for his adultery), he would fight successfully to diminish the influence of the Khoesan group from the Cape Colony, whom he then firmly wrote out of the history of the station. He dismissed several for immorality, despite the resistance, in which women played prominent roles, of members of the group. Moffat also found himself opposed by Griqua factions, many of whom resented his power-mongering presence.35 Before the late 1810s, the earliest LMS agents in southern Africa were not particularly good or even very enthusiastic apostles of capitalist cultural practices, mostly because they were so poor themselves and so looked-down-upon by many respectable members of colonial society. More than a few also tended to believe in dreams, to hear the personal voice of God, or to look for the imminent end of the world. Those missionaries who were closest in time to the Enlightenment, in sum, acted least like the bourgeois agents of respectability described by the Comaroffs as quintessential exemplars of the rationalizing project of modernity. The colonial unrespectability of early missionaries was compounded by the fact that perhaps a third of them married African women before 1817, while several were involved in sexual scandals. Others took high-profile political positions that were unpopular among settlers. The Comaroffs pick up the story as Moffat, in common with many of his fellows, was urgently trying to reclaim the moral high ground and to reinvent the mission as visibly respectable and as focused on "civilization." A lot of this is more about the internal history of the LMS than about African Christianity; we certainly in general need more of the latter and perhaps less of the former. Nonetheless, it argues for the importance of local detail, and for the centrality of fractures within as well as between groups. It also points forward to ways in which converts would later need to perform "civilization" and "respectability" in order to maneuver on the colonial stage, not solely because their consciousnesses had been colonized. From the start, tensions among evangelicals themselves were fueled by anxiety over the rapid removal of Christianity from the control of white missionaries. This tension was arguably innate to a type of evangelical Christianity based on textual interpretation and the notion of divine inspiration, as well as being the product of Tswana reconstruction of Christian forms. Certainly, missionaries soon lost control even of "orthodox" Christianity. Among the northern Tswana, Paul Landau has brilliantly documented the use of Christianity by junior royals to challenge existing authority in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in ways that escaped 34 LMS-SA, 6/4/A: James Read to Joseph Hardcastle, Bethelsdorp, August 7, 1816. 35 See Schapera, ed., Apprenticeship at Kuruman.

Among the southern Tswana, Thlaping elites also exploited divisions among missionaries to their own political ends. In 1842, for example, Tswana elite men successfully appealed to LMS superintendent John Philip to fire missionary Holloway Helmore for excessive interference in congregational affairs, including deposing Mothibi's son as a deacon.36 Missionaries to the Tswana experienced other humiliations. The coherent Tswana group targeted by the mission decamped, to be replaced by a more motley group of refugees. The mission was battered by raids from various groups, could not protect its members, and was not successful at all until it started picking up displaced persons in the 1830s. A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS arise from this type of re-reading. At a macro level, the region was already turbulent and populations were mobile, so Christianity scarcely arrived as the harbinger of globalization in anything other than an ideological sense. This raises in turn the thorny and ultimately unanswerable question of whether Christianity would have had the capacity to colonize minds without the prior disruption of material conditions. We are back at the difficult issue of how determinative "culture" is by itself. Perhaps in the end, this rejigging of chronology strengthens the Comaroffs' fundamental argument about the inextricability of "culture" and material struggle. It does nonetheless pose all the more sharply the question of how Christianity-and religious innovation, more broadly defined- functioned in a frontier zone in a manner that was independent of the machinations of white missionaries.37 Also at the "macro" level, the Tswana were not entirely "local," nor were they unused to cultural difference. In a multi-lingual, multi-religious environment, were missionaries really needed to contextualize "Tswana custom"? Missionary papers record Mothibi making distinctions between !Kora, Tswana, and colonial Khoekhoe customs, for example. I would not want to deny the importance of local identity, or to exaggerate the degree of long-range contacts of the southern Tswana, in contrast to the remarkable global reach and global identity claims of the early missionary movement. There are issues of tremendous importance raised by that contrast. But it also seems important that there were other regional interlocutors who were of greater material importance initially to the Tswana than the Europeans, and with whom they already had the kind of cultural interchanges that might have permitted the type of self-consciousness about "Tswana" identity that the Comaroffs see as the fruit of the "long conversation." This is also a way of asking about what the southern African interior looked like before formal European colonialism and whether the communities of the region were really as settled as they appeared. There are echoes here of an older debate about whether the encounter with the "macrocosmic" claims of the "world religions" Christianity and Islam shattered the 36 Landau, Realm of the Word; Elbourne, Blood Ground.

As Terence Ranger has argued, whatever the intellectual issues at stake, African societies, at least in the southern African interior, have to be recognized as also "macrocosmic" in the sense that they had long-range contacts, exchanged ideas over large swathes of territory (as the rapid spread of prophetic movements suggests), and rubbed up against a wide variety of different groups.38 The relative mobility of different communities was also a factor in breaking down localism. This type of approach, to my mind, decenters the European missionary-at least until the missionary came backed up by a colonial economy and a colonial army. The power exerted by the conditions of the "frontier zone" of the region is represented by the fact that even missionaries were compelled by material circumstances to take on features of African polities. The Comaroffs highlight the vision of Kuruman mission head and former gardener Robert Moffat, and his wife Mary, like that of many early nineteenth-century Nonconformist missionaries, as one of an unrealistic rural idyll, in which they sought to remake Africa in the image of a vanishing and imagined rural utopian Britain. One could, however, go further in considering the contradictions of Kuruman. Robert Moffat acted in many ways like an African leader as well as like a nostalgic Scot, and he needed to do so because of the material conditions of the frontier. In the 1820s, he proved unable to retain the allegiance of existing chiefs, for whom he was too clearly a competitor. As the refugee crisis accelerated, however, Moffat was able to gather together dispossessed people. The price of their admission was allegiance to the religion of the leader, since religion was used to rebuild communities. The currency of power was people. In similar ways, the control of women and their reproduction was important to the maintenance of the power of the patriarch, whether African chief or mission station head-Moffat even went so far, for example, as to attempt to discipline publicly Ann Hamilton, the wife of his colleague Robert Hamilton, for refusing to sleep with her husband.39 Moffat was more a part of the African frontier world than he might have liked to admit. A further critical point raised by this case study is that Africans transmitted Christianity more effectively than missionaries did. The centrality of Africans to the spread of Christianity means that much of the early history of the mission is unrecoverable. It is often unclear what kinds of Christianity were spread orally, for example. In other parts of southern Africa, prophetic figures emerged from time to time to use aspects of the Christian message in a context that suggests how quickly its language became unhinged from missionary guardianship. For example, Xhosa prophet and war hero Makanda Nxele (Makana), who led a Xhosa attack on the colony in 1819, had an earlier flirtation with the LMS; he was refused the right to work as a native agent when he insisted that there was a god for the white man and a god for the black man, and that he himself was related to Jesus Christ. The examples could be multiplied, as the Comaroffs would certainly agree.

In contrast to the Comaroffs, who emphasize the orthodoxy of the Nonconformists (whom they see in rather stereotypical, indeed Victorianist, terms), I would contend that this anxiety was familiar from debates within the European churches as well; after all, Methodism had once been perceived from within the citadels of Anglican orthodoxy in ways similar to Nonconformist views of African ecstatic innovation.40 If in the early days of missionary activity, Christianity was never fully in the control of the white missionaries who had brought it and only became popular once it was spread mostly by Africans and then transformed in the process, what does this imply about how we might conceptualize the study of colonial missions? I have suggested in the past that the messy scenario I outline above, with its complications and its fudging across the fault lines, calls into question the utility at the micro level of a strict dialectical approach to the history of colonial Christianity. The ghost of French structuralist understandings of G. W. Hegel's master-slave dialectic seems to me to hover over and to constrain the first volume. In response, however, the Comaroffs argue in Volume 2 that I have too conventional an understanding of their view of dialectical processes. A dialectic is not a "formal, abstract, or strictly teleological movement through time and space," in a Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a "process of reciprocal determination; a process of material, social and cultural articulation-involving sentient human beings rather than abstract forces or structures."41 Colonialism is dialectical because it creates binary understandings of difference and depends on the idea of opposites; it is also presumably dialectical because colonial interaction shapes both the colonized and the colonizer in new ways. Returning to the issue at the end of Volume 2, the Comaroffs reiterate (although this seems to me a somewhat different take) that by "dialectics" they mean "the mutually transforming play of social forces whose outcome is neither linear nor simply overdetermined." Defined thus, they add, "it is hard to imagine how colonial history could be regarded as anything else."42 In a weak sense, this is undeniable. Furthermore, on this model, it may not matter that the early encounter between missionaries and Tswana was so much messier than a "dialectical" account would suggest. The Comaroffs' point is precisely that out of difference and mess colonialism created binary opposites. At the same time, the exact nature of this process is often hard to capture. It is interesting to hear John Comaroff raise, in a recently published transcribed conversation with Homi Bhabha, what he terms the question of theory related to "the old Manichean opposition between colonizer and colonized, those 'iteratively marked,' positionally conflated points of reference around which the human geography of empire is so widely imagined. How, other than purely by descriptive insistence, does one displace the crushing logic of binarism in terms of which 40 Among many possibilities, see Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters: Female Preaching and Popular Religion in Industrial England (Princeton, N.J., 1985). 41 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 29. 42 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 410.

Perhaps my own discomfort arises from the difficulty of defining who the agents of dialectic are. In the end, the Comaroffs are interested in doing a historical anthropology of colonialism, more than of religion in colonial contexts. In this optic, the fault line of interest is that between colonized and colonizer. Religious belief did not, however, adhere to that fault line, even though both colonized and colonizers mobilized religion to the ends of power struggle. Nor of course was Christianity itself static. At the same time, the very notion of ethnic difference was still in the process of being worked out more broadly well past the early era of industrialization; therefore it was incorporated differently into the views of colonial evangelists at different times. From the point of view of the Comaroffs' overall narrative structure, this leads us away from the Enlightenment and onto the terrain of more immediately nineteenth-century colonial concerns. On this model, colonial conquest and the need to maintain and justify white rule shaped the mid- nineteenth-century culture of white Christianity. The end was not contained in the beginning but formed by colonial processes. Be that as it may, it is instructive that the Khoesan themselves were not able indefinitely to maintain the interstitial status to which Christianity gave them some access. By the early 1850s, many living in the Cape Colony were forced to choose between the colonial binaries of "black" and "white," in the 1850-1853 frontier war in which many people of Khoesan descent rebelled to fight against the "white" colony, as "race" became the determinant of colonial identity.44 The example also underscores the importance of "black" and "white" as colonial binaries arguably of more importance than "English" and "Tswana." All this should not, however, lead us to read the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in terms of the mid-nineteenth. There is a basic problem here that dogs the Comaroffs throughout the books. Christianity is both text and practice, and therefore difficult to pin down. Not only that, it also permits and contains a wide variety both of practices and of different interpretations of its central themes. As text, Christianity became a free-floating signifier. As a practice, it was fought over bitterly by those who wanted to benefit from it. It is therefore difficult to identify Christianity clearly with one side of a dialectical or even dialogic model. This is all the more problematic because it is hard to define Christianity clearly, other than by appeals to authority. There was considerable scope for Africans to reinvent Christianity even from the beginning of the mission described by the Comaroffs. In some ways, this is precisely the Comaroffs' point: the signs of Christianity were fought over by competing ethnic groups. The Comaroffs nonetheless cannot bring themselves to see acceptance of Christianity in its unadulterated mission form as anything other than a defeat for 43 Bhabha and Comaroff, "Speaking of Postcoloniality," 22. 44 Elbourne, Blood Ground, 345-76; Robert Ross, "The Kat River Rebellion and Khoikhoi Nationalism: The Fate of an Ethnic Identification," Kronos: Journal of Cape History/Tydskrif vir Kaaplandse Geskiedenis 24 (November 1997): 91-105.

This position ultimately obscures complexity. EVENTUALLY, ONE MUST CONFRONT the type of question raised by Leon de Kock, about disciplinary conventions and the fetishization of the archive.45 De Kock argues that historians have spent too much time in their reaction to this wonderful book looking for factual flaws. To put the question in its boldest form, are the details really that essential to the overall project? Perhaps less tendentiously, what are the Comaroffs doing that goes beyond the reading of the words of colonists? The Comaroffs are important precisely because they move beyond words to decipher the gestures of people in the past. They put an anthropologist's emphasis on ritual and performance. They add thereby a crucial dimension to our reading of culture-bound historical archives. The Comaroffs' understanding of performance goes well beyond the staged performances of religious rites (although they acknowledge at the same time that people used the framework of religious ritual as a springboard for their own acting out of emotions and ideas). The missionaries are described as performing civilization, in the hope of educating the Tswana to adopt Western cultural practices through the power of display. In response, the Tswana performed noncompliance or acted out cultural bricolage. The tangible display of the body interests the Comaroffs, just as the material suffering of the colonized body that we readers know is to come provides a moral template for our reading of the early nineteenth century. The authors are particularly interested in space and the disposition of the body in space: their analyses frequently return, like the apartheid state itself, to issues of the control of the movement of African bodies.46 The Comaroffs are in some ways mistrustful of the self-interested and one-sided colonial text and find more solidity in the unspoken exchanges of bodily perfor- mance. It is this approach that both furnishes the greatest richness of the books and yet at the same time has excited unease in some interlocutors. If the evidence that remains of Tswana actions is mostly accounts of their physical activity, does that not place the reporter (the anthropologist, the historian, or even the reader) in the privileged position of interpreting Tswana actions, leaving the Tswana themselves rarely free to speak directly in their own voice? Is this even an accurate assessment of the nature of the historical record, or are there more extensive Tswana records? J. D. Y. Peel and Terence Ranger have both queried the absence of Tswana 45 De Kock, "For and Against the Comaroffs." 46 For example, Volume 2 tellingly argues that integral to the late nineteenth-century struggle over African labor was a further struggle over the "distribution of people in space and, concomitantly, their passage across the social landscape." This is a typical discussion of space that appropriately reflects the struggle of the apartheid state to control the physical body, just as slavery had earlier lent mastery of the body to the slaveowner.

The Comaroffs have responded that community historical narrative was not a genre espoused by the Tswana. They argue, furthermore, that the quest for "narrative" is elitist: it is "a short step from the stress on narrative to the history of elites, thence to elitist history."48 The issue remains uneasily unresolved. For Paul Landau, the Comaroffs themselves have a culturally constrained view of what constitutes "genuine narrative." They pay "little attention to genealogy, song, Tswana conversation, letters, political speech, tales, myth or church charters- because they are not 'genuine' narratives. Consequently Tswana people's ideas of fulfillment and transcendence do not show themselves in either volume."49 Even the Tswana intellectual and politician Sol Plaatje's great novel Mhudi, which draws on Tswana traditions about the difaqane, has been brought into the fray: for the Comaroffs, the fact that Plaatje himself claims that he could only gather material in fragments suggests that the southern Tswana indeed did not have a tradition of sustained historical narrative as late as the early twentieth century, even though Mhudi is more conventionally seen as a reflection at least to some extent of more sustained Tswana oral tradition.50 There is another critical debate at work in these discussions of agency and voice. The Comaroffs are very clear that missionary activity was part of the victimization of Africans. Much recent scholarship on southern African Christianity emphasizes instead the agency of Africans in using and reshaping Christianity to their own ends, as the focus has shifted away from missionaries and onto African Christians. In some ways, the Comaroffs want to restore a sense of moral indignation at the ways in which colonial missions did change the consciousness of Africans in a damaging fashion. Ironically, this may involve seeing people as victims who did not necessarily see themselves that way at the time-another issue of authorial voice. The Comaroffs' anger represents nonetheless an important strand of longstanding protest across the colonized world at the "colonization of the mind."51 It is impossible to deny that many Christian missionaries had a profoundly negative 47 J.

Furthermore, as Peggy Brock has persuasively argued, missionary institutional structures affected the degree of control missionaries could exert over congregations, and these structures were affected by indigenous social arrangements as well as by state power.53 I would further contend, in ways there is not space to elaborate on fully here, that shame was a key element of colonial control. Mission education could and did reinforce this. At the same time, Christianity could also provide a language through which to reclaim dignity and deny the shaming process. I think it is important in sum to see Christianity as a language with many possible uses. Conversion, for example, fulfilled a wider and more flexible range of functions than is suggested by the Comaroffs' reduction of it to a symbolic field of struggle over capitalism. A reading that focuses too exclusively on Christianity as a language of cultural domination rather than a language with a multiplicity of possible meanings pays too much attention to the Western roots of Christianity and not enough to the multiple uses to which Africans very quickly put it. I make this comment in awareness of the extent to which the Comaroffs emphasize the need to explore African perspectives through every possible means, and the extent to which they clearly do this. However, conversion was even more of an empty signifier than the Comaroffs suggest, and some of these significations did not have a lot to do with rational capitalism. On the other hand, conversion was also an act, with attached rituals and beliefs, and this is important for understanding what the act meant in the immediate rather than long-term sense. Even if I am not completely at ease with a victimization model, I would want to add that these were and are enormously complicated processes. They had deep and often painful implications for many. This demands humility from any historian. Undergirding much of the above has been a historian's concern with chronology, which, while justified, cannot do full justice to the rich ferment of ideas in these remarkable books. The Comaroffs in fact comment on what they see as different disciplinary conventions and their inherent costs and benefits. They see real and longstanding differences, as they remark at the end of Volume 2, between the ideal type of a more conventional historian and the archetypal historical anthropologist: "differences between the ideographic and the nomothetic, between the effort to arrive at the fullest possible description of events in their infinite particularity and the desire to pick out general principles across time and space." The latter approach, they underscore, "demands a certain boldness of abstraction" and is "inherently risky."54 Although one would hope that historians are not as painstak- ingly antiquarian and abstraction-averse as this implies, there is some justice to the 52 A wonderfully instructive example of the ambiguities of Christian liberal control of the education system in South Africa, just before apartheid, is furnished by Shula Marks, ed., Not Either an Experimental Doll: The Separate Worlds of Three South African Women (London, 1985). 53 Peggy Brock, "Mission Encounters in the Colonial World: British Columbia and South-West Australia," Journal of Religious History 24, no. 2 (June 2000): 159-79. 54 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 411.

The very manner in which they offer up a multitude of bold ideas, fizzing with possibility, also ensures that they offer a number of hostages to fortune. The Comaroffs are, for example, probably the most influential of recent scholars to argue for tight linkage between missionary activity, "modernity," "Enlighten- ment," and globalization. As Brian Stanley points out, this is also a question that has been much debated in the past few years by Christian theologians and mission theorists, with theologians paying particular attention to the damage done by the universalist truth claims of mission Christianity.55 More broadly, the Comaroffs are participating in a vast debate about modernity and postmodernity among social, political, and cultural theorists that it would be foolhardy to venture upon here. Their contribution is both important and vexed: important because they show the culturally constrained nature of claims to "modernity," vexed because despite everything they reify the truth claims of modernity and have too neat a view of the "Enlightenment," despite substantial historical debate on the utility of the concept. In so doing, they exaggerate the long-term influence of mission Christianity on the material subjugation of the Tswana, particularly by minimizing the impact of illiberal forces and overemphasizing cultural change. This could be true, however, and the significance of the Comaroffs' analysis of practice still be undimmed. The Comaroffs see "modernity" as "always historically constructed." It is in their view "an ideological formation in terms of which societies valorize their own practices by contrast to the specter of barbarism and other marks of negation."56 The Comaroffs link modernity to a view of the self as a rights-bearing atomistic individual, ultimately the "fully fledged bourgeois subject." They further associate modernity with a wide-ranging series of cultural and economic practices, including but not limited to dependence on a worldwide market, industrialization, the use of money, the use of "advanced" agricultural practices, the promotion of individuated space, and a sense of the body as private.57 It is part of the great richness of the Comaroffs' approach that they so fruitfully link cultural and economic practices, refusing to prioritize one over the other. At the same time, this view of modernity is slippery-and this is both its richness and an occasional source of frustration. The Comaroffs move between presenting the truth claims of modernity-its "text," if one likes-and the concrete material practices that advocates saw as characterizing the modern. The authors' desire not to take the truth claims of missionaries at face value make it difficult for them to spell out what, if any, were the irreducible material practices that defined modernity. If there weren't any, however, what was the material force behind the cultural claims and practices of missionaries? Yet it is arguable that at least some of what the Comaroffs identify as the 55 Brian Stanley, "Christian Missions and the Enlightenment: A Reevaluation," in Stanley, ed., Christian Missions and the Enlightenment (Grand Rapids, Mich., 2001), 1-2. Stanley points to David Bosch's Transforming Mission: Paradigm Shifts in Theology of Mission (Maryknoll, N.Y., 1991) as a seminal text for Christian theologians of mission in a postmodern context. 56 Comaroff and Comaroff, Of Revelation and Revolution, 2: 32. 57 A particularly influential figure for the Comaroffs' reading of the creation of the modern self in Volume 2 is Charles Taylor, whose Sources of the Self is a seminal text for their work. Taylor is of course a Christian Hegelian, whose view of the emergence of the modern self is certainly influenced by Hegelian dialectics, in however inexplicit a fashion.

There are echoes here of the great debates between radical and liberal historians in 1970s and 1980s South Africa, split over the origins of apartheid.58 For the "radical" school, liberalism, in both its ideological and economic sense, contributed to the economic domination that was at the root of apartheid. Radical historians argued that late nineteenth-century British capitalism precipitated and anticipated many features of South African society under apartheid, just as the Comaroffs here blame nine- teenth-century British liberal ideas about such things as money, markets, the individuated self, and the primacy of certain gender roles for the mental prepara- tion of the Tswana for labor oppression. Indeed, in their 2000 article "Millennial Capitalism: First Thoughts on a Second Coming," the Comaroffs explicitly link what they term the "Age of Revolution" (1789-1848) to the current "Age of Millennial Capitalism" with their similar anxieties and ontological challenges.59 This article makes explicit the magical, mystical elements of neoliberalism, and its culturally constrained forms, in contrast to neoliberals' claims to rationality and access to universal truth, just as Of Revelation and Revolution describes culturally constructed views of "modernity" and a "modern" economy. This is very helpful. Nonetheless, I think it would also be useful in Of Revelation and Revolution to be more explicit about actual intellectual debates among and between people: to have more ideology in places and less hegemony. The argument made by many, that early twentieth-century white liberals in practice came to support racist segregationist policies, while in ideological terms liberalism's support of the free market economy and nonviolent political action left it with little space to mobilize opposition to apartheid, all adds up to a trenchant and at least partially justified critique. By leaving out of the picture the intellectual shifts in liberalism (and among the opponents of liberalism) on the ground in the nineteenth century (and implicitly in the twentieth), however, the Comaroffs, like other authors, conflate several ills into one. Disciplinary specialists might want to throw further darts at the Comaroffs' narrative superstructure. Must industrialization and by implication modernity really begin in 1789? This is very French. What might be the impact of the questioning by economists of the linearity and suddenness of industrialization in Britain, which now looks more like an extended messy process than a "revolution" within neat chronological parameters? What difference does it make that the evangelical movement had many roots in seventeenth and eighteenth-century continental pietism? If Protestantism is the necessary condition of capitalism, where does this leave Catholic countries (not least France)? The point I want to close on is, however, that of tragedy. If there is, as I have suggested, an implicit narrative of origins that runs throughout Of Revelation and Revolution and lends the work its moral passion, this is not, for all that, a straightforward linear narrative of beginnings and ends. Rather, it is marked by 58 Christopher Saunders, The Making of the South African Past: Major Historians on Race and Class (Cape Town, 1988), describes the liberal/radical split. 59 Jean Comaroff and John L.

The Nonconformist missionaries who labored so intensely to change the daily lives of Africans in order to induct them into the "modern" economy did not foresee the devastating consequences of that economy for the Tswana peasantry (as might be said of some of the missionaries' modern counterparts, development workers). At the same time, the Comaroffs write as though missionaries inducted the Tswana into the global market and colonized their consciousness in a way that made their engagement more likely. It seems to me just as possible that the global market and related economic coercion came crashing into the lives and consciousness of the Tswana in a way about which they could do little, particularly as their contact was frequently mediated by coercive legislation on the part of the colonial state.60 Missionaries reflected the efforts of other Westerners to moralize the market: to see it as a force for moral good. In this, they shared the ambiguities (and guilty conscience?) of nineteenth-century liberalism. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to find contemporary parallels in the neoliberal discourse, and of course the Comaroffs are right that this putatively universalist creed contains deeply embedded culturally specific assumptions, as did nineteenth-century Anglo- American liberalism itself.61 If nonetheless market expansion is relatively inevita- ble, then is it not appropriate to ask on what terms this expansion might be the most moral? Or is the most appropriate response full-fledged resistance? Must the global marketplace necessarily be bad, on average, for Africa? From a somewhat different point on the ideological spectrum, one might also ask whether in fact Africa is incorporated into the global market on the equal terms supposedly demanded by neoliberal economics. These are clearly issues beyond the scope of this article, but not without historical parallels. In late nineteenth and early twentieth-century terms, the Tswana, it could be argued, were crowded out of an agricultural market in which many were making profits and farming more effectively than whites, in fact, in order to favor white farmers artificially and in order to bolster labor for the mines, again through "artificial" restraints on movement, through the theft of land, through racially targeted taxation, and through coercive legislation. This antici- pated many of the later strategies of apartheid.62 It is not as clear to me as it is to the Comaroffs that the questions some missionaries and Africans were asking about the possibility of a just economy were not the right ones, even if the culturally constrained answers they gave were so obviously, hopelessly wrong. I do not have answers to these questions either-merely some sympathy with the misguided quest for certainty in a rapidly changing, brutal, and deeply uncertain economic universe. 60 This is a point also made by Landau, "Hegemony and History." 61 Uday Mehta, Liberalism and Empire: A Study in Nineteenth-Century British Liberal Thought (Chicago, 1999); Mehta, "Liberal Strategies of Exclusion," in Stoler and Cooper, Tensions of Empire, 59-86. 62 Ted Matsetela, "The Life Story of Mma-Pooe: Aspects of Sharecropping and Proletarianization in the Northern Orange Free State 1890-1930," in Shula Marks and Richard Rathbone, eds., Industrialization and Social Change in South Africa (New York, 1982), 212-37; Charles Van Onselen, The Seed Is Mine: The Life of Kas Maine, a South African Sharecropper, 1894-1985 (Cape Town, 1996).

In contrast, I see Christianity as important but, with some important exceptions, not necessarily white missionaries themselves. I also suggest that the linkages between political and cultural colonialism are often unclear in Of Revelation and Revolution, and that the role of "cultural colonialism" is overdetermined. If it is possible to guess about such counterfactuals, I suspect that at least some of the missionaries whose work has been scrutinized by the Comaroffs would ironically have preferred the Comaroffs' account of their activities to mine, however doubtless upset they would have been at the implication that their preaching laid the groundwork for the Tswana's entrapment within enslaving capitalist systems. But the Comaroffs do give the missionaries credit for a coherent, rationalizing, globalizing system that taught one universal truth. They also recognize the missionaries' own belief that they might instill into their converts the necessary principles of "civilization" to transform totally their supposedly primitive economies and to move them rapidly up the scale of human development toward settled commercial societies. My own interpretation, while recognizing the tremendous importance of the universalizing project as a mode of domination, calls into question the capacity of Christianity to convey as effectively as it would have liked a message of unifying orthodoxy, or indeed the overall ability of missionaries to accomplish their objectives. From the very beginning of the activity of Christians in Africa, as elsewhere in the world, Christianity was out of control, unorthodox, and an available subject for reinter- pretation in light of the needs of its interlocutors. Ironically, in sum, it is not always wise to take missionaries at their word.

Her publications include Blood Ground: Colonialism, Missions and the Contest for Christianity in the Cape Colony and Britain, 1799-1853 (2002), as well as various articles, most recently "Domesticity and Disposession: British Ideologies of 'Home' and the Primitive at Work in the Early Nineteenth-Century Cape," in Wendy Woodward, Patricia Hayes, and Gary Minkley, eds., Deep Histories: Gender and Colonialism in Southern Africa (2002). She earned her D.Phil. in 1992 from the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Terence Ranger. Her major fields of interest include colonialism, gender, and religion, especially the early nineteenth- century British white settler empire and southern Africa. Her current work in progress explores the creation of networks around the idea of being "aborig- inal" in the early nineteenth-century British empire, and is focusing on links between New South Wales, the Cape Colony, New Zealand, and Canadian colonies as well as on activists in Great Britain. She is also writing on liberalism and Khoekhoe citizenship at the Cape. AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW 459 APRIL 2003 [[END 03X0760F]]<br>

Abstract: Ibid., p. 111. Even Riffaterre's approach to the structuring unsaid of textual writing can be seen to represent on its own terms a shift from the ontology of narrative toward its epistemology at the level of form rather than content. By the deliberate provocation of his title, his semiotic narratology is interested not just in the structural essence of fiction as art but in its specific
            truth:a story's immanent signifying patterns in their subtextual disclosure.<br>

Abstract: I conclude, then, that the task of theological ethics and, more broadly, the humanities and, if I can be bold, more broadly still the university itself is to examine carefully and critically and from multiple perspectives—including the religions—what it means to be and to live as responsible human beings within the vulnerabilities and complexities of forms of life. When we within our several disciplines respond to this task with all the vitality and resources at our disposal, then, I believe, knowledge will indeed grow from more to more, and life will be increased without the illusions of power or servitude to the tyranny of idols.<br>

            Theodramatik(Einselden: Johannes, 1980), 3:363–78. Von Balthasar’s use of dramatic conceptuality seems to satisfy these demands by offering the Eucharist as a phenomenon that is surprising and free yet deeply imbedded within the economy of creation as a drama. Also of significance would be Bernd Wannenwetsch,Political Worship: Ethics for Christian Citizens, trans. Margaret Kohl (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004).<br>

Abstract: It is true, of course, that we have a much harder time postulating an author for
            Adaptation—that is, working out what an “ideal” Kaufman would have wanted the overall effect of his film to be—than postulating an author for the average Hollywood movie. Still, it is surely not the case thatAdaptation“undermines the concept of the author as a unifying origin and legitimation,” as Karen Diehl claims (Karen Diehl, “Once upon an Adaptation: Traces of the Authorial on Film,” inBooks in Motion: Adaptation, Intertextuality, Authorship, ed. Mireia Aragay [Amsterdam, 2005], p. 100). It may be harder to know what Kaufman is up to than what James Cameron (say) is up to, but Kaufman is clearly up tosomething, and the film bears if anything a more powerful stamp of an original vision than that average movie we find easier to read. In fact,Adaptationhas only solidified Kaufman's reputation as a filmmaker with an idiosyncratic and internally consistent way of seeing the world. (Although cinema is a collaborative enterprise, it is reasonable to imagine Spike Jonze and company collectively seeking to realize Kaufman's design.) Far from putting inherited notions of authorship into question, then, it has comfortably positioned Kaufman as the “unifying origin” of his various works.<br>

Abstract: The Captivity of Innocencesuccessfully concludes an innovative study of primeval myth in J’s Genesis. Its argument about exilic authorship serves as a springboard for a free and erudite exploration of biblical concerns with name, exile, and the paradoxes of divine-human relations. Very few biblical scholars today can compass this range of biblical, literary, and philosophical literature with such finesse. At a time when biblical studies incorporate a wider range of methods than ever, LaCocque, like Roland Barthes (whom he cites), powerfully combines traditional and more contemporary intellectual paradigms. Advanced students and scholars will find inThe Captivity of Innocencea far-reaching and engaging reading of Genesis 11 by a virtuoso of biblical studies.<br>

Abstract: Pablo Wright observes that while I leave behind Geertz’s concept of a cultural system with respect to morality, I retain the Geertzian concern with symbols and meaning. I would not dispute Wright’s statement that meaning is the master concept on a methodological level prior to the substantive issue of evil but would stress that in addition to idiom, code, practice, and symbol, experience must figure into a comprehensive account. Wright’s evocative references to “moral installation in the world” (one might consider terms like investment, suffusion, and tonality, as well as installation) and morality as a “practiced ontology in the micropolitics of social life” deserve further elaboration. Wright endorses a pluralized notion of moralities, but I reiterate that even more important is an adjectival sense of moral rather than the nominal morality. Like Parkin, Wright poses the question of how to reintroduce the ethnographically salient notions of cosmological and radical evil once evil is first construed as a human and intersubjective phenomenon. The answer is to ask how these dimensions come into play in the experiential immediacy of social life, for example, how a cosmological battle between angels and devils is experienced concretely on the human scale. Finally, he suggests that concepts of power from Otto and the shadow from Jung may be alternatives to the notion of evil, though I rejoin that they are just as much in need of critique with respect to Christian overtones. They may be valuable for the study of morality but are not suitable replacements for evil in the sense for which I have argued.<br>

Abstract: This paper explores visual response methods as a representation of student learning in a college-level interdisciplinary curriculum integrating art and engineering. The visual response methods, specifically visual journals and postcards, are examples of authentic assessment and alternative data collection methods embedded in a mixed-methods (qualitative dominant) practitioner research case study. In the paper, we focus on different means for analyzing these visual responses (e.g., through hermeneutic analysis, document analysis, and narrative analysis) and deliberate the contribution of diverse analysis methods to the researchers’ understanding of students’ experiences of interdisciplinarity in this course.<br>

Abstract: Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market" (1862) has garnered seemingly limitless critical interpretation — the goblins' remarkable fruit inviting allegorical readings of the poem that reference, most popularly, Christianity, sexuality, and capitalism. In this essay I read fruit simply as food, situating the poem within the context of food adulteration contemporary with its 1859 composition. Food adulteration was a widespread problem in Victorian England, as increasing numbers of merchants cut flour with alum, doctored curry with mercury, and enhanced the appearance of potted fruits and vegetables with copper and lead. Public alarm regarding this form of fraud reached its height in the 1850s, largely due to the work of an independent Analytical Sanitary Commission, which published its findings in
         The Lancetbetween 1851 and 1854. While Parliament responded to these reports with the formation of a Select Committee in 1855, the popular press responded with articles, tracts, and ballads addressing this pandemic problem. Manuals that instructed consumers how to protect themselves by acquiring the accoutrements of home laboratories proliferated, as did references to adulteration in popular literature. In this essay I read Rossetti's poem as an example of this type of reference. The market of the poem's title, I argue, references a literally contaminated marketplace in which the numbers of people who ate ostensibly nutritious food, only to wither and die in consequence, provoked both governmental and popular alarm.<br>

Abstract: Drawing on my own fieldwork experiences with the transnational Integral Yoga community, this essay offers some reflections on two possible approaches to bridging insider-outsider perspectives in the study of new religious movements. First, I consider Gerald Larson's suggestion of a “relationship of mutual reciprocity” between researcher and religious community. Second, I discuss the value of a participatory approach that attempts to integrate engaged participation with critical distance in the study of religion. I use my collaborative experience co-authoring an academic article on Sri Aurobindo and the contemporary yoga scene with an Integral Yoga practitioner to argue that while Larson's reciprocal enterprise risks either sacrificing critical concerns to apologetic agendas, or polarizing the insider as apologetic and the outsider as reductive, a participatory approach proposes a way to put insider-outsider perspectives into a more creative relation.<br>

Abstract: Abstract: Vico's theory of metaphor is best understood as a monster in the tradition of classical rhetorical invention. It is the mutant offspring of metaphor characterized as "necessary" (an "ear" of com, for example) and metaphor characterized in terms of analogy. From the perspective of his method. Vico marries these apparently incompatible forms inherited from Aristotle and thereby identifies a third type of linguistic metaphor. I argue that the metaphor identifies a stipulatory definition taken out of context. In order to situate this claim, I outline Vico's genetic analysis and elaborate in general terms what metaphor and definition share. Most importantly. Vico insists that beings, actions, and events are linguistically identifiedin some particular diseursive context. Indeed, in many cases that context alone determines whether the expression can be called a definition or a metaphor. Like Cicero's ideal jurist, Vico's hero employs motivated words and realizes possibilities available to common sense. Henee Vico's theory of metaphor is both "constructivist"—language has the power to makes things—and "humartist"—it must do so in a form appropriate to history and culture. Vico's theory is consequently important to us because it challenges the proper/figurative distinction championed in the philosophy of language and adds a pragmatic dimension to contemporary views of metaphor at work in literary theory.<br>

Abstract: Three different types of interpretative research in education are discussed: ethnographic-descriptive, dialogical, and structuralistic. The special concepts of interpretation and validity connected with each of these approaches are elaborated and examples are given. The author comes to the conclusion that it is misleading to use the term "interpretative methods" in a general way, because the differences in the types of interpretive research are ignored. He argues that in educational research a dialogical, argumentative concept of validating interpretations is necessary.<br>

Abstract: The study of metaphor provides valuable insights into the workings of thought and understanding. This article addresses the important question of what the study of metaphor has to say about the design process and design teaching. We include the findings of a series of studies involving architectural design students who were asked to report on their own design experience and that of colleagues in the context of specific projects. Our conclusions are that (1) there is a close relationship between design and metaphor that provides insights into effective design education; (2) metaphor operates through privilege, directing concern and the identification of difference; and (3) design involves the generation of action within a collaborative environment in which there is the free play of enabling metaphors.<br>

Abstract: The very definition of myth is problematic today; here narrow, partial, "monomythic" definitions are rejected in favor of a complex, inclusive one, the seventeen items of which are then discussed. A mythological corpus consists of a network of myths, which are culturally-important imaginal stories conveying, by means of metaphor and symbol, graphic imagery, and emotional conviction and participation, the primal, foundational accounts of the real, experienced world, and humankind's roles and relative statuses within it. Mythologies may convey the political and moral values of a culture, and provide systems of interpreting individual experience within a universal perspective, which may include the intervention of suprahuman entities, as well as aspects of the natural and cultural orders. Myths may be enacted or reflected in rituals, ceremonies, and dramas, or provide materials for secondary elaborations. Only a polyphasic definition will provide appreciation of their manifold roles within a society.<br>

Abstract: This essay explores the relation of authority to legitimacy through the social construction of local histories that validate claims to 'authentic' rulership. Using the historical example of the Chiefdom of Uyombe in northern Zambia, I intend to argue that the construction of these local histories has been a crucial element in the process of domination, subjugation, resistance and collaboration between rulers and those they would rule. Exploring specific Gramscian concepts, I will also argue that historical narratives contain hegemonic and ideological components that are critical to relating authority to legitimacy in an active manner. These narratives contain African voices, which express varied local interests. Through the narratives, Africans may be seen as active agents in contributing to the making of their own local histories of rulership. Thus, authority and legitimacy are conjoined through the fabrication, inscription and recitation of historical narratives and are an essential part of governance.<br>

Abstract: Academia's mathematical metaphysics are briefly explored en route to an elaboration of the qualitatively rigorous requirements underpinning the calibration and unambiguous interpretation of quantitative instrumentation in any science. Of particular interest are Gadamer's emphases on number as the paradigm of the noetic, on the role of play in interpretation, and on Hegel's sense of method as the activity of the thing itself that thought experiences. These point toward and overlap with (1) Latour's study of the metrological social networks through which technological phenomena are brought into language as modes of being that can be understood, and (2) the way that Rasch's models for measurement comprise a potential beginning for metaphysically astute, qualitatively and quantitatively integrated, mathematical methods in the social sciences. The paper closes with observations on the general problem that is philosophy, the need to remain open to multiplicities of meaning even as clear understandings are sought and obtained.<br>

Abstract: L'AERES dialogue avec certains organismes de recherche pour tenir compte de leurs missions
spécifiques dans le système d'évaluation. Mais cette démarche ne semble pas, au moins pour le moment,
devoir être formalisée ou étendue. Ce dialogue est facilité par le nombre restreint des organismes et c'est
évidemment plus difficile de le mener avec les quelque deux cents autres établissements d'enseignement
supérieur que l'agence doit auditer. Mais on peut imaginer quelques options entre lesquelles les établisse-
ments auraient à choisir. Et ceux qui souhaiteraient une évaluation encore plus spécifique pourraient être
amenés à en assumer une partie du coût.<br>

Abstract: Dopo un periodo, negli anni Sessanta e Settanta, in cui la fortuna di Lovejoy sembrò
declinare, lo studioso è tornato d'attualità negli anni Ottanta, con la ripresa della di-
scussione teorica intorno alia storia intellettuale. Nel 1987 il «Journal of the History of
Ideas» dedicò un numero per celebrare il mezzo secolo della Great Chain of Being, con
articoli di D.J. Wilson, G. Gordon-Bournique, E.P. Mahoney, F. Oakley e Melvin Ri-
chter (cfr. Lovejoy, «The Great Chain of Being» and the History of Ideas, in «Journal of
the History of Ideas», 48, 2, 1987). Contributi importanti sono inoltre venuti da Donald
R. Kelley, Tattuale editor del «Journal». Tra questi citiamo D.R. Kelley, Horizons of In-
tellectual History: Retrospect, Circumspect, Prospect, in «Journal of the History of Ideas»,
48, 1, 1987, pp. 143-169; e, sempre di Kelley, What is happening to the History of Ideas?,
in «Journal of the History of Ideas», 51, 1990, pp. 3-25. Proprio quest'ultimo articolo
rappresenta a tutt'oggi uno dei piú equilibrad tentativi di bilancio della history of ideas,
e al tempo stesso una meditazione sui futuro della disciplina da parte di uno degli «ere-
di» di Lovejoy. Significativamente Kelley propone di utilizzare Tespressione intellectual
history, e non piú history of ideas, proprio a voler allontanare i «fantasmi» di idealismo
impliciti nella scelta di fare della storia della filosofia il referente privilegiato della di-
sciplina (un'attitudine che era certamente di Lovejoy). Intellectual history è secondo Kel-
ley «doing a kind, or several kinds, of historical interpretation, in which philosophy and
literature figure not as controlling methods but as human creations suggesting the con-
ditions of historical understanding» [What is happening, cit., p. 18). L'approccio inter-
disciplinare, che era stato uno dei punti centrali del programma lovejoyano, rimane an-
cor oggi secondo Kelley valido, anche se ciò non deve significare Tadozione di strumenti
critici «alla moda» propri di altre discipline. A questo proposito si pone per Kelley il
problema dell'atteggiamento da tenere nei confronti di studiosi come Hayden White,
Dominick LaCapra, David Harlan, teorici del linguistic turn, un modo di fare storia che
si awale delle indicazioni provenienti dall'ermeneutica di Gadamer e Ricoeur, da Hei-
degger e dai suoi discepoli francesi Foucault e Derrida, e che rifiuta ogni reale possibi-
lità di giungere a una determinazione delle intenzioni dell'autore, cioè di un «significa-
to», della verità di un'opera, e del contesto entro cui Topera è stata composta. Per Kel-
ley non era possibile evitare le implicazioni che il linguistic turn poneva, tanto piú che
esso si rivelava utile soprattutto nel rivelare risorse, strutture, memorie culturali conser-
vate nel linguaggio (topoi, tropi, metafore, analogie), non soltanto dell'alta cultura ma
anche delle forme di espressione irriflessa, o popolare (anche questo secondo un'indica-
zione di Lovejoy). Se è però vero che il significato di un testo non è univoco, è altret-
tanto vero secondo Kelley che la ricerca delle intenzioni dell'autore è premessa indi-
spensabile di qualsiasi lavoro di storia intellettuale. Quanto alia questione dell'attenzio-
ne al «contesto», che i sostenitori del linguistic turn denigrano, Kelley prende atto che
non è certamente possibile giungere alia ricostruzione dell'intera rete di relazioni entro
cui un'opera si colloca. Ciò non significa pero che il testo o l'autore studiato non pos-
sano essere collocati in un «contesto», e che quindi, attraverso lo studio del linguaggio
di un'epoca, non si riesca a ricostruire le condizioni di possibilità per la nascita di
un'opera.<br>

reconocido como "manifiesto" de la semiótica de la Escuela de Praga, este bosquejo, general-
mente mal traducido, no tuvo el menor eco en la semiótica posterior, embarrada en los pañales
de la sémiologie saussureana o en la tupida escolástica peirceana. Habría que releerlo junto con
el gran trabajo revisionista y desconstructivista, "La intencionalidad y la no intencionalidad en
el arte" (1943). Ambos ahora en Signo, función y valor.<br>

several cultures instead of just one and consequently at the time when we acknowledge
the end of a sort of cultural monopoly, be it illusory or real, we are threatened with the
destruction of our own discovery. Suddenly it becomes possible that there are just
others, that we ourselves are an 'other' among others" (History and Truth [Evanston,

Abstract: This article draws on ethnographic examples to examine how rural Maya-speakers in the Mexican state of Yucatán ground the experience of identity politics in quotidian engagements with pre-Hispanic objects and utterances in the Maya language. My argument is intended as a revision of models of critical scholarship that have been influenced by poststructuralism and that place an overwhelming emphasis on discourse as a modality through which politically viable identities are created and performed. Specific examples show how vernacular multiculturalism is shaped by the agency of forms of language use and physical objects that have been a part of local life-worlds long before the popularization of Mayan identity politics. This offers some potentials for collaborative work that have not been fully explored in poststructural critiques of representation. L'auteur s'appuie sur des exemples ethnographiques pour étudier la manière dont les locuteurs du maya vivant dans les zones rurales de l'état mexicain du Yucatán fondent leur expérience de la politique identitaire sur une interaction quotidienne avec les objets et énoncés préhispaniques de la langue maya. Son argumentation se veut une remise en cause des modèles universitaires critiques influencés par le poststructuralisme, qui mettent lourdement l'accent sur le discours en tant que modalité permettant de créer et de réaliser des identités politiquement viables. Des exemples concrets montrent comme un multiculturalisme vernaculaire se constitue par l'action des formes d'usage du langage et des objets matériels qui faisaient partie de la vie locale longtemps avant que la politique identitaire maya se popularise. Cette approche offre un potentiel de travail en collaboration qui n'a pas été complètement exploré par les critiques poststructuralistes de la représentation.<br>

Abstract: This essay focuses on a strange medieval phenomenon, the so-called gift of tears—religious weeping that brings beatitude. This internal purifying process, which was embedded in the specific conditions of historical Christianity, was described and understood as a procedure in which God himself acts and, therefore, as a process that humankind cannot learn, formalize, or ritualize. However, the author analyzes religious weeping as a peculiar, 'intimate ritual' in which the formalized process took place in the soul or spirituality of the weeping person. This essay aims to describe and analyze this practice while examining the historical conditions that enabled such a cultural elaboration to develop.<br>

Abstract: This paper presents an historical outlook on the macro-micro distinction in modern sociology. It links the genesis of social interactionism and microsociology to the rise of Romantic philosophy and attempts to elaborate methodological principles dividing macro- and microscopic perspectives in sociology. Six ideal-typical distinctions are considered: natural vs. social universality, emergent properties vs. emergent processes, morphological structuralism vs. genetical interactionism, choice among socially structured alternatives vs. structuring appearance into reality, structural vs. emergent directionality, operational vs. hermeneutical analysis. The complementarity of the languages of macro- and microsociological theories is advocated as a foundation for the further elaboration of conceptual links between the two levels of analysis.<br>

Abstract: Nietzsche's impact on educational thought has always been surprisingly neglected, possibly because it is hard to divorce his educational views from his philosophical endeavour, as a whole which has given rise to considerable scholarly polemics during the last few decades. Recently several articles propagating various interpretations of Nietzsche's educational teaching have been published Their main weakness lies in the fact that Nietzsche's central educational theses are discussed quite apart from his "psychological" philosophy, while it is the philosophy that serves as the necessary background for understanding those theses. The present paper, mainly analyzing nietzsche's essay "Schopenhauer as Educator", will attempt to provide a better insight into Nietzsche's early psychological and pedagogic thought. It will also demonsrate those basic criteria implicit in his method of psychologization, which at the very outset had served Nietzsche as an educational means of testing the integrity of certain examplary personalities. Nietzsche's Educational Thought is established in the service of authenticity — a central and influential Existentialist concept, the main ideas of which are explicated in the paper. Another Nietzschean concept, much negleted yet significant, that of the "Higher-Self", is elaborated and compared to Freud's parallel notion of the "Super-Ego".<br>

Abstract: Although the character of Job's wife has been given very little space in the biblical text of Job, she has been treated by many exegetes as significant. There are two main streams of interpretation in which she has figured prominently. In classical Christian approaches, ranging from Augustine to some modern commentators such as Habel, Job's wife tends to be regarded as a temptress in the mold of Eve and as a collaborator of the Satan. Post-modern, especially feminist, approaches tend to rehabilitate the character of Job's wife, accrediting her with prompting Job's critical reflection and with anticipating the direction in which the plot of the book develops. In the present article, interpretive approaches to Job's wife, including the favorable approach of some Jewish exegesis of antiquity, as well as the somewhat middle road of medieval Jewish exegesis, are surveyed. A critical discussion of feminist treatments of Job's wife deals primarily with the work of Newsom, Pardes and van Wolde. The place of Job's wife in the book is assessed with regard to how her theological views compare to those of the Satan on the one hand, and Job on the other, as well as to her role as a catalyst in the plot.<br>

Abstract: Set in the exiled poet's "marginal" home in the Channel Islands, Les Travailleurs de la mer (1866) elaborates a vision of creative potential. Science, dreams, meditation, natural forces, physical prowess, selfess devotion, even death—all serve as vehicles for expanding the boundaries of our universe, both internal and external. The protagonist, Gilliatt, avails himself of these multiple modes of transport to challenge our notion of the humanly—and inhumanly—possible. Transcending his own limits to conquer a wide array of "monsters," he links the motifs of movement and displacement in Hugo's hypertropic narrative to the transpositions of metaphor, the sublime, and political exile.<br>

Abstract: In this article I suggest ways in which rhetorical analysis can complement sociological analysis of early Christianity. On the basis of a universally acknowledged saying of Jesus ("blessed are you poor"), I suggest that those who use social scientific perspectives need to clarify more accurately the levels of data from which they are working (i.e., when they are working with probably early material, possibly the words of Jesus himself, and when they are working with the later elaboration of the traditional material) and to identify the rhetorical value of each level. I then show how, contrary to sociological analysis that depicts Jesus as merely proclaiming reversal, the historical Jesus proclaimed a reversal that had already happened but one that was away from God's intended order: what the historical Jesus was calling for was a future restoration to a state that existed before the reversal. Attention to the rhetorical nature of his follower's use of this proclamation, however, shows that when the author of the Gospel of Luke and the Lukan Acts of the Apostles uses the language of reversal and restoration, he now does so to describe what was happening not primarily vis-à-vis "the world" but in their own, now Christian communities Jesus' message of reversal of the fate of the poor becomes in this way the Lukan message of the apostolic governance of that reversal, that is, the broker's (the apostolic leadership's, after the model of Jesus) dispensation of the patron's (God's) resources.<br>

Abstract: In order to manage our daily lives, we make many decisions based on empirical evidence derived from instrumental action. At the other extreme, we are often attracted by a so-called postmodern solution that invites us to make arbitrary choices. In the education system, the pressing dilemma should not be a choice between standards of competence or unthinking relativism, but how to take action towards intercultural tolerance. Establishing a small teacher training course for a group of British Muslims has shown that communicative action informed by understanding can be disabled by the instrumentality of positivist frameworks, such as those used by government inspectors. In philosophy, Ricoeur offers a provisional dialectic of hope that can be used to show why neither positivist methods, rational analytic philosophy, postmodernity nor any one belief system for interpreting the world should be allowed to exert hegemonic control. The ethicopractical philosophy of Ricoeur also offers a reconstructive view of reality that helps us to rehabilitate belief in human nature and encourages us to seek solutions to conflicts of interpretation in understanding others. It is applied, in this instance, to project work with Muslim women in the UK, in which an ontology of action shows the power of working collaboratively towards an understanding of oneself as another.<br>

Abstract: This paper addresses the combination of theology and humanism by reflecting on Christian identity. Beginning with Paul Ricoeur's theory of fiction as a laboratory of 'imaginative variations' on the possibilities of ethical selfhood, I ask: if the world projected by the Christian scriptures overturns human possibilities, what happens to the Christian self's ethical responsibility? I analyse the motion pictures Fight Club, Memento, and The Matrix to interpret extreme cases or 'unimaginable variations' on the theme of conversion among broken, fragmented, and manipulated selves. I argue that The Matrix presents a form of conversion most conducive to fulfilling ethical responsibility.<br>

Abstract: Examining the relevance of communitarian thought for feminist theory, this essay considers the idea of narrative identity in certain types of communitarianism and feminism. It claims that the particular way in which the idea of narrative identity is elaborated raises difficulties for a feminist understanding of gender identity. The syncretic and over generalised idea of narrative identity derived from communitarian thought ode snot adequately grasp important aspects of the ways in which gender inequalities are constructed.<br>

Abstract: Pozzi, Scrittrici mistiche italiane, p. 462: "Nel 1629 cessarono le visioni e le estasi. La fama di
quelle meraviglie, uscita dalla clausura, aveva perô provocato il fenomeno, comune a molte altre
estatiche, di un grande traffico spirituale intomo alla suora: le scrissero senza tregua religiosi e
prelati,... ma le scrissero soprattutto dame dell'alta aristocrazia, dai vicini ducati di Mantova e
. Savoia alle lontane plaghe di Spagna, Boemia, Baviera. Roma intervenne allora col solito rigore;
senza emettere condanne, le proibl ogni corrispondenza con Testerno. Cos! calô su di lei un
silenzio non piu rotto da fatti straordinari né da rumori del secolo, fino alla morte, avvenuta il 12
febbraio 1671".<br>

Abstract: Un autre exemple de trivialité : au début de son texte, Badiou évoque un conflit, une
« guerre abstraite » actuellement en cours entre vision juive et vision chrétienne de l'histoire;
et donc, selon lui, la Mémoire... s'inscrit dans cette rivalité pour conquérir la « direction spiri-
tuelle du camp "démocratique" ». Et attention, Ricœur vise à « rien moins qu'une victoire »!
Le déclin de l'influence chrétienne et le brio de la pensée juive au sens large (sans garantie de
durée!) dans la culture française et européenne sont patents, mais ce constat accrédite-t-il une
vision paranoïaque de la vie intellectuelle? D'autres exemples dans le Siècle, op. cit., par
exemple une parole d'un poème de Celan inspiré de la mémoire d'Auschwitz, rapportée par
Badiou aux slogans des manifestants de décembre 1995 pour leur retraite, à Roanne-Trifouillis-
les-Oies : « Tous ensemble, tous ensemble, ouais! » (p. 139).<br>

Abstract: Daß die Verstiegenheiten und Mißbräuche, welche die Scholiasten der Spätantike seit
der Kaiserzeit mit der Etymologie getrieben haben, aller ernsten Grundlagen entbehrten
und reine Fabrikation ebenso mittelmäßiger wie phantasievoller Wichtigtuer darstellten,
die sich „Philologen" und „Grammatiker" nannten und noch bis in die byzantinische Epoche
hinein fortwirkten, ist allgemein bekannt (s. zum Beispiel die vielfachen Entlarvungen dieses
durch die Jahrhunderte mitgeschleppten Ballastes von Pseudogelehrsamkeit bei W. G. Ruther-
ford, A Chapter in the History of Annotation, Being Scholia Aristophanica, Bd. III, London
1905, S. 392 etc). Daß die ebenso irrationalen und vielleicht noch geschmackloseren ety-
mologischen Spekulationen, die man im 20. Jahrhundert auf die Wortgruppe έρμηνεία, έρμη-
νεύειν, ερμηνευτικός anwendete und immer noch anwendet, im gängigen akademischen Lehr-
betrieb heute ernst genommen werden und sich professoraler Autorität erfreuen, ist nicht
nur ein bildungsgeschichtliches curiosum, sondern ein Zeugnis irrationaler Aushöhlung der
„geisteswissenschaftlichen" Fakultäten. Als Beispiel seien nur erwähnt Karl Kerényi, Her-
meneia und Hermeneutike, Ursprung und Sinn der Hermeneutik in ders., Griechische Grundbegriffe,
Fragen und Antworten aus der heutigen Situation, Zürich 1964, 42-52, und F. K. Mayr, Der
Gott Hermes und die Hermeneutik in Tijdschrift voor Filosofie, 30, 1968, 525-635. Wie der Autor
des zuletzt genannten Artikels selbst, auf Heideggers Formulierung zurückgreifend, sagt,
ist das „Spiel des Denkens verbindlicher als die Strenge der Wissenschaft"... Wohin eine
im Banne Heideggers stehende „Begriffsgeschichte" führt, kann man bei der Lektüre dieses
Schwalls besser „verstehen"... Wie wenig Tragweite die immer wieder angeführte (Techné)
hermeneutike in der Epinomis 975 c hat, sagt der Text selbst: bei der Kunst Orakel zu inter-
pretieren, die weder Seelengröße noch Weisheit hervorbringt, weiß der „Interpret" nur,
was er sagt, ob es jedoch wahr ist, hat er nicht gelernt (τό λεγόμενον γάρ οίδεν μόνον, εΐ
δ' αληθές, ούχ έμαθεν). Übrigens kommt das Wort έρμηνευτική in den pseudo-platonischen
Definitiones in seiner sonst gebräuchlichen Bedeutung vor, 414 d 4: "Ονομα διάλεκτος άσιλιθετος
έρμηνεντική τοϋ τε κατά τής ουσίας κατηγορουμένου και παντός του μή καθ' έαντοϋ λεγομένου.
(Nomen, zuzusammengesetzte Ausdrucksweise für etwas seinem Wesen entsprechend
Bezeichnetes, sowie auch für alles von diesem Ausgesagtes). — Pierre Chantraine, Dictionnaire
Etymologique de la Langue Grecque, Histoire des Mots, Paris, 1970, S. 373, sagt ausdrücklich,
„Terme technique sans étymologid'. Vgl. auch F. Solmsen, Ein dorisches Komödienstück in Rheinisches
Museum für Philologie NF 63, 1908, 329-340. (dort s. 336 f über den ionischen Ursprung
der Worte έρμηνεΰσα, έρμηνεύς).<br>

Abstract: An initial awareness is needed of the debates regarding the choice of research approaches in sociology and the diversity and specificity of methods currently being used in the domain of textual data analysis in France. In general the influence of the French socio-linguistic tradition looms large, including, on the one hand, the older works of Michel Pécheux on the "discursive formations" and his A.A.D. (Analyse Automatique du Discours, 1969), and on the other hand, two main perspectives of the "Ecole Française d'Analyse du/de Discours" - which refer to the "speech act" concept and to the problematics of enunciation, and emphasizes the processes and "sociodiscursive practices" between socially-located speakers. Such theoretical conceptions and specific requirements lead to build on methodologies different from the classic, theme-based content analysis, though not yet translated into an operational software. Then the main software developments currently having an impact (at least potential) on practices of computer-aided sociological analysis of textual data, in France, are classified : from the lexicometric using procedures of "French Data Analysis" ('Analyse Factorielle des Correspondances' of Benzecri, and so on...), to a set of "expert-systems" working on specific theoretical frameworks, through more classical methods of content analysis and coding-sorting-retrieving socio-semantic procedures, eventually with various statistical methods. L'auteur expose d'abord quelques considèrations épistémologiques générales sur les présupposés implicites des méthodes de recherche sociologique, abusivement séparées en qualitatives et quantitatives, et des interrogations spécifiques sur le statut des corpus textuels et des pratiques socio-discursives dans différents domaines et selon divers types de problématique en sociologie. Puis, après un résumé des problématiques sociolinguistiques de l'"énonciation", propres aux courants de l'Analyse de Discours à la française", il propose une classification des principaux lieux d'élaboration théorico-méthodologique ayant (ou susceptibles d'avoir) un impact sur les pratiques informatisées d'analyse textuelle: de la lexicométrique inspirée de l'"Analyse des données a la française", actuellement dominante, a des quasi-systèmes-experts, branchés sur des problématiques sociologiques particulières, en passant par des méthodes plus "classiques" d'analyse de contenu thématique, de type socio-sémantique, et de codification a posteriori de réponses à des questions ouvertes et autres énoncés produits en langage naturel.<br>

Abstract: In this essay, I argue that Penelope Fitzgerald's The Gate of Angels attempts to work out the difficulties that any intelligent, religiously inclined person must come to terms with in the twentieth, now twentieth-first, century. Fitzgerald sought not to shelter her religious belief behind a cloister wall, thinking like her uncle the Reverend Wilfred Knox, "that no cloister walls can be high enough to exclude the cares of the world." Among these cares is the desire to give a faithful report of the world to each other, to know this world as it exists in truth, and not to misrepresent it. Early twentieth-century investigations into the makeup of the physical world as well as the theoretical and intellectual advances possible with quantum physics were very much part of this desire; and in The Gate of Angels, set in and around Cambridge University's pre-war physics laboratories, Fitzgerald offers a beautiful rendering of the excitement engendered by these investigations. At the same time, Fitzgerald offers a picture, true to her own experience, wherein things that in the popular mind are often conceived of as opposite and irreconcilable—for instance, chance and necessity—are found to stand in a relation of sympathy, casting over The Gate of Angels "that sympathetic glow which," Henry James wrote, "forms half the substance of our genial impressions."<br>

Abstract: Le présent article s'inscrit dans le prolongement d'une recherche en cours portant sur la compréhension et l'analyse des usages de jeux vidéo en ligne par des personnes en situation de handicap. En soulignant les apports épistémiques et méthodologiques d'une ethnographie en ligne, il pointe les limites heuristiques de la classique distinction entre un monde supposé réel qui se verrait redoublé par son pendant virtuel. L'exemple précis des jeux vidéo permet ici non seulement de questionner la dichotomie virtuel / réel mais aussi la définition traditionnelle du jeu élaborée à partir du modèle de la règle distincte de son effectuation concrète. L'analyse des pratiques ludiques de personnes en situation de handicap pointe enfin la nécessité d'une attention portée sur les modes d'appropriation corporelle d'un dispositif techno-communicationnel. En conséquence, il s'agit d'envisager les formes d'expériences vidéo-ludiques comme des « instances de procuration » autorisant l'exploration sensible de mondes moins disjoints les uns des autres qu'en interaction constante. This article is a continuation of ongoing research to understand the uses of online gaming by people with physical disabilities. By emphasizing the epistemic and methodological contributions of online ethnography, it points to the heuristic limits of the traditional distinction between a supposedly real world and that which would be repeated in the virtual. The specific use of video games in this example, makes it possible not only to question the virtual–real dichotomy, but also to question the traditional definition of the game which starts from the premise that the rule is distinct from its concrete execution. Analysis of the recreational practices of disabled people also points to the need for attention to modes of bodily appropriation of techno-communication devices. In the end, it is a question of considering video entertainment experiences like "instances of proxy," authorizing the sensitive exploration of worlds that are less disconnected and instead are in constant interaction.<br>

Abstract: Dès ses premières réflexions portant sur le volontaire et l'involontaire, Ricœur aborde frontalement l'énigme du mal. Si celle-ci croise la tradition biblique et la philosophie, elle ne conduit pas la pensée à souscrire à une théodicée mais à élaborer une pensée de l'agir. Pour Ricœur, l'être est acte plutôt que substance car il engage à l'action pour répliquer au mal.<br>

Abstract: This article examines the ethical responsibilities of relating and responding to subjects of oppression in the context of collaborative life writing. One well-established ethical response to oppression is the practice of recognition. Drawing on the phenomenological ethics of Emmanuel Levinas and Paul Ricoeur, as well as the related work of Kelly Oliver, I raise some of the limitations of recognition, and delineate the ethical alternative of witnessing, bringing both to bear on my collaborative work with Holocaust survivor Rhodea Shandler.<br>

Abstract: Because they escape precise modal qualification, Troost suggests that insight into disposi-
tions can only be gained in an idea-ruled (idee-matig) understanding, in an idea-regulated 'on
the way' in the transcendental direction of time. For reformational philosophy this raises an
old and prima facie purely theoretical problem: Do the modalities 'continue' right into the
heart? One could paraphrase Troost's view for example such that for him the heart should
primarily be sought 'below' or 'behind' the act structure, and that the dispositions — relative
to this vertical axis — constitute a horizontal layer in which the lower substructures are
interwoven with the act structure. In that case the integration of the lower structures in the act
structure would take place via the dispositions rather than through a direct relationship with
the heart. This notion — for which hints can be found in Dooyeweerd — would in any case
lead to an appreciably more nuanced picture of the 'binding' and 'releasing' of substructures.
If I understand Troost correctly, he would allow this interpretation for the substructures,
though not for the modalities. His caution concerning the 'continuing' of the modalities 'into
the' heart is epistemological: the cosmological concentration of the modal functions in the
heart is a transcendental idea; at best we see dots (the idea-regulated 'on the way' in the
transcendental direction of time), but we should not turn them into lines.<br>

Abstract: The struggles for recognition, focused on cultural and identity issues until recently, are returning to public arenas in the form of struggles for legal recognition, precisely when we are witnessing, in the context of the post-2008 economic recession, a downward review of citizenship rights, in particular social and labour rights. This article discusses this issue by: first, associating education to the struggles for legal recognition, using the «moral grammar of social conflicts» of Axel Honneth; second, showing how education, connected to empowerment, may have an interesting role in the qualification of social actors involved in these struggles; third, defining the major articulations of this educational role in terms of empowerment. The article concludes by demonstrating the strategic role of empowerment, when promoted by education, in the struggles against the recession of subjective or citizenship rights. Las luchas por el reconocimiento, centradas hasta hace poco en aspectos culturales e identitarios, vuelven al dominio público en forma de luchas por el reconocimiento legal, precisamente cuando estamos asistiendo, en el contexto de la recesión económica posterior a 2008, a una revisión a la baja de los derechos de ciudadanía, particularmente de los derechos sociales y laborales. Este artículo aborda este problema: primero, asociando la educación con las luchas por el reconocimiento legal, en base a la «gramática moral de los conflictos sociales» de Axel Honneth; segundo, mostrando cómo la educación, conectada con el empoderamiento, puede desempeñar un interesante papel en la cualificación de los actores sociales involucrados en estas luchas y, en tercer lugar, definiendo las principales expresiones de este papel de la educación en términos de empoderamiento. El artículo concluye demostrando el estratégico papel del empoderamiento, cuando es potenciado por la educación, en las luchas contra la recesión de los derechos subjetivos o de ciudadanía.<br>

Abstract: La destruction symbolique du corps (similaire à la promotion de la latinisation,
latinx.ua 拉丁イヒ）chez Lu Xun est différente des représentations dualisantes de la
Nouvelle littérature des années 1920, opposant à l'âme souffrante le corps déprécié,
qui expriment ainsi directement leurs frustrations. Pourtant, Lu Xun n'est pas un
« contempteur du corps », même si ceiui-ci tend à servir surtout « l'esprit » (voir Gao
2007 :181). Il vise le Kôrper, non le Leib, insistant avec Nietzsche sur le processus
de vie (leben) et le rejet du désir de mort, mais rejetant l'esthétique du corps et du
surhomme. Lu Xun combat le corps comme expression figée et obstacle à la vie, pour
contrer la souffrance de cette impossibilité à régénérer la voix. Cependant, le corps
littéraire, par sa destruction symbolique et sa mise à distance comme signe, laisse
soupçonner une ultime aliénation du corps. Car, si le corps individuel comme « lieu
ou scène de la manifestation [d'un] trouble » est « premier signifiant mis en œuvre par
le langage » (StarobinsKi 1981:273), comment comprendre qu il soit tu ？ C'est peut-
être la dernière souffrance, celle du corps muet, obligé de demeurer un signe statique
interdit de parole individuelle, au nom de la dénonciation du silence collectif et du
refus de l'épanchement.<br>

Abstract: The myth of an economy where nobody could have a predominant position, has lost its credibility. The presentiment of a high risk of social explosion makes companies undertake tentative moral legitimation. Thus, a new paradigm develops according to which the firm has to care for the satisfaction of public interest if "it wants to try to win forgiveness" for misbehavior towards the decorum rules of the atomicity of competition. Thus, there is a wave of "business ethics industry" building up. However, the stock exchange performances considered as ethical, are not different from others! The market does not seem to be able to say why it might be interesting to invest in stock considered as ethical. Moreover, opinion polls reveal a very significant discrepancy between the characterization of "the responsible company" as defined by itself or by notation agencies and, on the other hand, the hierarchy of criteria according to the answers of polled people. When companies and agencies favor sustainable development and good governance, rejecting child labor and so on, polled people consider that the paramount criterion of ethical conduct is personnel management. The problem is right here. Such is the view of a positively critical economist, situated at the point where macroeconomics meets corporate management.<br>

Abstract: Ricordo, a titolo di esempio, solo alcuni degli scrittori e degli studiosi che non
hanno avuto, per così dire, accesso alla rassegna (pur se implicitamente e continuamente
vivissimi all'attenzione di chi scrive) per l'impossibilità oggettiva di esibire lo sconfinato
universo delle presenze bibliche nella letteratura compresa tra il Duecento e il primo Ot-
tocento: il Dante delle opere 'minori', soprattutto della Vita Nuova (V. Branca, G. Gor-
ni), la predicazione medievale e moderna (C. Delcorno, R. Rusconi, L. Bolzoni, J. Berlioz,
etc.), le laude (G. Varanini, R. Bettarini, F. Mancini etc.), la sacra rappresentazione (M.
Martelli, N. Newbigin, F. Doglio, G. Ponte, F. Pezzarossa), il Boccaccio delle Rime e
delle Epistole (V. Branca, G. Auzzas) e di alcune parti del Decameron (P. Cherchi), la
produzione 'sacra' tassiana (Rime Sacre, Mondo Creato), l'Aretino (Larivaille) e il Folengo
(M. Chiesa, S. Gatti) nei panni di scrittori cristiani, l'Arcadia edificante, per riprendere
un titolo preciso del Di Biase, certa tragedia sacra settecentesca come quella di Martello
(I. Magnani, P. Trivero) e, soprattutto, l'Alfieri biblico del Saul e dell'Abele (A. Di Bene-
detto, E. Raimondi), lo Jacopo Ortis (M. A. Terzoli) e l'Ipercalisse del Foscolo (B. Rosada,
A. Forlini), il linguaggio poetico religioso del Porta (G. Pozzi) e del Belli, il Tommaseo
(M. Guglielminetti), il Pascoli (A. Traina, G. Goffis), D'Annunzio e molti altri ancora:
spesso, tra l'altro, privi di una vera e propria bibliografia «scritturale» a largo spettro,
se non di studi singoli, difficilmente annoverabili nell'ambito ristretto di una precisazione
doverosa, ma non esaustiva. Va detto anche che, sebbene la rassegna si chiuda con il
1995, qua e là è stato segnalato qualche libro del 1996, a cui si vuole ora aggiungere,
senza l'ambizione di averne citato tutti i volumi relativi all'oggetto delle precedenti pagi-
ne, A. Stauble, Le sirene eterne. Studi sull'eredità classica e biblica nella letteratura italia-
na, Ravenna, Longo, 1996; e E. Esposito, R. Manica, N. Longo, R. Scrivano, Memo-

Author(s): Zigurs Marshall Scott<br>
Abstract: The past decade has brought advanced information technologies, which include electronic messaging systems, executive information systems, collaborative systems, group decision support systems, and other technologies that use sophisticated information management to enable multiparty participation in organization activities. Developers and users of these systems hold high hopes for their potential to change organizations for the better, but actual changes often do not occur, or occur inconsistently. We propose adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a viable approach for studying the role of advanced information technologies in organization change. AST examines the change process from two vantage points: (1) the types of structures that are provided by advanced technologies, and (2) the structures that actually emerge in human action as people interact with these technologies. To illustrate the principles of AST, we consider the small group meeting and the use of a group decision support system (GDSS). A GDSS is an interesting technology for study because it can be structured in a myriad of ways, and social interaction unfolds as the GDSS is used. Both the structure of the technology and the emergent structure of social action can be studied. We begin by positioning AST among competing theoretical perspectives of technology and change. Next, we describe the theoretical roots and scope of the theory as it is applied to GDSS use and state the essential assumptions, concepts, and propositions of AST. We outline an analytic strategy for applying AST principles and provide an illustration of how our analytic approach can shed light on the impacts of advanced technologies on organizations. A major strength of AST is that it expounds the nature of social structures within advanced information technologies and the key interaction processes that figure in their use. By capturing these processes and tracing their impacts, we can reveal the complexity of technology-organization relationships. We can attain a better understanding of how to implement technologies, and we may also be able to develop improved designs or educational programs that promote productive adaptations.<br>

Author(s): Webster Steven<br>
Abstract: Using the hermeneutical theory of Paul Ricoeur, it is possible to discern symbolic dimensions in cultural anthropology. Symbols, here, are dominant images in anthropologists' texts, creatively posited by inquirers, that, most importantly, possess a surplus of meaning. A symbol's fullest surplus of meaning is a prereflexive and comprehensive "understanding" (Verstehen) that may encompass a scholar's attempts at "explanation" (Erklaren). Examples of this symbolic dimension are the "understandings" that lie implicit in two elaborate anthropological systems: Levi-Strauss's structuralism and Harris's cultural materialism. Amid their commitments to anthropological "science" and "explanation," the works of each disclose a distinctive Verstehen. For Levi-Strauss, this "understanding" is nurtured by his image "world of reciprocity." For Harris, it is carried by the image "nature." This "understanding" has two major functions. On the level of the intellectual coherence of their texts, it gives unity to their intercultural interpretations of other societies and to their intracultural interpretations of their own traditions. On a moral level, it includes modes of being-in-the-world that Levi-Strauss and Harris prefer and ocasionally press upon their readers. Discernment of symbolic dimensions of "understanding" in anthropologists' texts may be an initial step toward reflection on the matrices out of which diverse explanations are presented in anthropological literature.<br>

Abstract: Con más vehemencia que entendimiento algunos colegas han insistido en la oposición, y aún contradicción, entre la historia literaria y la teoría literaria. El concepto de la historia como un pasado fijo e inalterable desde luego que será incompatible no sólo con la teoría literaria sino con todo pensamiento crítico. Sin embargo, quiero insistir que la mayor parte de los historiadores contemporáneos no comparten las premisas positivistas del historicismo. La historia como un pasado que se hace y rehace en el presente por la labor del historiador queda plenamente relacionada con la teoría literaria contemporánea. Ya lo lo percibían Juan Luis Vives y Giambattista Vico.<br>

Abstract: La hermenéutica es una disciplina filosófica dedicada a la interpretación de textos culturales. Aunque tiene sus orígenes en el siglo diecisiete ha sido en los últimos treinta años que se ha distanciado de la influencia idealista de Dilthey y ha tomado un lugar prominente en los debates teóricos que han caracterizado nuestro tiempo. La época contemporánea de la hermenéutica parte de Heidegger y Gadamer; ante la crítica de Habermas y Derrida se reelaboran cuestiones centrales de intención, intencionalidad, lo determinado e indeterminado, y se emprende la hermenéutica postmoderna de Paul Ricoeur. Mis libros han venido desarrollando una teoría y crítica literaria basada en los principios hermenéuticos que aquí se demuestran en otro medio. El lector encontrará un estudio hermenéutico de la representación de la mujer en películas hispánicas que han sido parte de nuestra cultura colectiva. El artículo tiene cinco partes: principios hermenéuticos y resumen de los films; comentario hermenéutico sobre los tres films y las tres protagonistas: Ana, Gloria, Julia; problemática de la representación de la mujer en el cine; el símbolo fílmico de la mujer en su contexto social; y la función reflexiva del cine.<br>

Abstract: Ciertos filmes españoles recientes plantean un enfrentamiento con el pasado en el que destacan unas elaboraciones imaginarias densas, retóricas y alejadas de la vertiente naturalista y realista, e incluso documental, que caracterizó al cine de la transición a la democracia. Para poder conducirlas, las tramas detectivescas se han convertido en una estrategia común de estas nuevas lecturas del pasado. En ellas se identifica un trayecto hermenéutico con otro biográfico, el del personaje-detective, e histórico. Y todo ello en un marco narrativo definido por continuas metáforas del totalitarismo, referidas sobre todo a las imágenes tenebristas de la postguerra española. El cine español contemporáneo se ha distanciado de esa reflexión crítica con el pasado reciente pero permite, en filmes como los que nos ocupan en este trabajo, que las sombras de sus fantasmas se proyecten sobre el presente impregnándolo con una atmósfera de pesadilla. El relato parece conducirnos a una verdad esencial en la que siempre aparece aguardar la figura de un siniestro demiurgo, depositario final del sentido de la búsqueda.<br>

Abstract: The essential significance of scientific metaphor lies in applying the general metaphorical theory to specific interpretations and elaborations of scientific theories to form a methodology of scientific explanation. It is a contextual grasp of objective reality. A given metaphorical context and its grasp of the essence of reality can only be valid when the context is continually restructured. Taking the context as a whole, the methodological characteristic of scientific metaphor lies in the unity of understanding and choice, experience and concepts, semantic structures and metaphorical domains, rationality and irrationality. As a form of thinking based on reasons, scientific metaphor plays an important role in invention, representation, explanation, evaluation, and communication. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦐒𶄶𤡇𠁁𢌒𤅸𣕘𙥨𳌤𰍀𸕄𡥇𩜂𵝰𤈒𩦒𠄐𱆅𣎘𩜂𵝰𰍀𠡕𠌇𵊙𷌢 𡙄𵠨𦄦𠀓, 𰀁𧒒𤐘𥄄𙥨𱆁𱆅𣎘𵊙𷌢𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𤘅𤠙. 𣐧𦅙𣕅𣑘𵉦𣑔𢌒𰍀𙥨𱆁𵠡𢙙𡉰 𥈦𥕩, 𡒂𦍷𵠡𢙙𰍀𙦁𦀩𷌥𦔀, 𥅥𳀡𲑳𣑐𸕄𡥇𵠡𢙙𰍀𣎄𢌒𡑐𠡔𥈦𥕩𣑔𢌒𦐒𶄶𰍀 𦍷𥤨𤘕. 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𰍀𦁁𧡡𵝰𩌅𤑉𴤠𩘖𠀦: 𩜂𵊙𙦂𶡳𥌡, 𲑣𹕤𙦂𧀐𤕥, 𵠡𠁁𲑧𦔀𙦂 𸕄𡥇𢒕, 𩜂𤘕𙦂𸝐𩜂𤘕𰍀𲑹𙥨. 𠌖𠀦𙥨𱆁𦍷𩜂𰀁𥔒𩜂𰍀𤘅𲔀𤐘𤌵, 𱆅𣎘𸕄𡥇𠡕𦍷 𡑗𦄦, 𴤠𤑉, 𵠨𦄦, 𵞀𠈕𡑐𠄲𧥩𱕡𦁁𸝔𰍀𷌥𵈁𡅑𳀡.<br>

Abstract: Although a very important figure in interdisciplinary social theory, Nietzsche is absent from sociological theory, especially in the United States. Equating rationalization with cultural homogenization and liquidation of particularity, Nietzsche saw "decadence" where modern social theorists saw progress. He held that sociology drapes cultural domination, regimentation, and exhaustion with the appearance of legitimacy. This essay explores his views about the depletion of social resources stressed in modern theory. It elaborates his "antisociology" and then traces the impact of this framework on three divergent currents of social theory. Nietzsche is read against the backdrop of modern theory in order to explore his continuing challenge to this tradition and his relevance to sociology.<br>

Abstract: « Le temps présent est devenu éphémère, irréversible et insaisissable »,
dit A. Y. Gourevitch. Il est aussi homogène et orienté. L'historien sovié-
tique ajoute : « Pour la première fois, l'homme a constaté que le temps dont
il ne décelait le cours qu'à travers les événements, ne s'arrête pas, même en
l'absence d'événement. » A. Y. Gourevitch réintroduit ici une acception
métaphysique du temps, s'il entend bien par événements des phénomènes,
alors que dans le reste de sa contribution, il paraît convaincu de la maté-
rialité du temps. La preuve expérimentale de l'existence du temps hors des
phénomènes n'a pas été fournie et ne peut l'être. Les temps dans lesquels
nous vivons, sont celui de notre existence même, celui de notre société, celui
des mouvements des astres, etc. L'homme ne « constate » donc pas que le
temps ne s'arrête pas même en l'absence d'événement, ces événements lui
sont cachés par l'usage d'un temps quantitatif qui se réfère à l'un d'entre
eux exprimé par les horloges, devenu la référence unique, apparemment
« dématérialisé » par son omnipotence et occultant l'existence des autres
temps.<br>

Abstract: Dans Les Chemins du paradis, Gorz est plus précis. En fait, il n'y a pas deux niveaux (macro-
social hétéronome et individuel autonome), mais trois (les deux précédents plus un niveau micro-
social autonome). Résumons ces trois niveaux: « 1) le travail macrosocial hétéronome, organisé
à l'échelle de la société tout entière et qui assure le fonctionnement ainsi que la couverture des
besoins de base [de l'ensemble des membres de la société] ; 2) les activités microsociales, coopéra-
tives, communautaires ou associatives, auto-organisées à l'échelle locale et qui auront un caractère
facultatif et volontaire, sauf dans les cas où elles se substituent au travail macrosocial pour couvrir
des besoins de base ; 3) les activités autonomes correspondant aux projets et désir personnels des
individus, familles ou petits groupes. » (Gorz [1988], p. 125-126.)<br>

Abstract: Muslims, and other people whose religions are based in scripture, develop and transform stories from scripture to explain local practices in world-religious terms, yet anthropologists seldom study these processes. This article concerns elaborations on Islamic traditions by Gayo people in highland Sumatra, Indonesia. Gayo narrators draw on stories of Adam and Eve's children to account for processes of birth, hunting and agriculture. Special attention is given here to the functions played by ideas of sibling conflict, improper marriage, and gender in these narrative transformations.<br>

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and theorize the topology of 'vision' in field ecology, a domain considerably different from laboratory work in the physical sciences, and discuss the temporal extension of data-collection practices. Data collection in this field is characterized by widely varying measurements, measurement dimensions and temporal extension of data collection. We present the ecologists' field laboratory as a perceptual machinery with a heterogeneous and heteromaterial topology as it pertains to measures, precision, replication and other material practices. Because of the complexity of ecological fieldwork, considerable co-ordination and articulation work is necessary. Here, tables, tags and labels are central tools to achieve coherence of inscriptions. We topicalize the work that digitizes measurements conducted on lizards and their habitats, and that therefore imposes signs that lend themselves to mathematical and statistical processes. It is only through these digitizing processes that lizards become visible to other (interested) ecologists, most of whom have not seen this particular animal species in person. We thereby contribute in new ways to discussions of the topography and topology of scientific vision, to the relation of measurement to practice, and to the 'adequation' of nature and mathematics.<br>

Abstract: Ruskin's complex attitude toward women has long been important to feminist and Victorian studies; over a quarter-century ago Kate Millett published Sexual Politics and its famous attack on Ruskin's essay "Of Queens' Gardens." She charged Ruskin with promoting a sugar-coated but perfidious system of separate spheres for men and women. Yet shortly after Ruskin produced that idealized vision of housewife-queens in 1865, he created a new ideal queen in his mythological study The Queen of the Air (1869), this time elaborated from Athena. Through his mythopoesis, Ruskin disrupts both conventional gender categories and his own implication in them. Ruskin presents a series of binary oppositions that he immediately conflates: Athena and Medusa, air and earth, bird and snake, formation and destruction, science and myth, male and female. Ruskin documents the instability of his oppositions through a bizarre "natural language" where real-life creatures such as birds and snakes serve as eternal hieroglyphs, signifying universally recognizable abstractions. That seemingly fixed signs in Athena's hieroglyphic code inevitably change is clear from Ruskin's acknowledgment of Darwin's evolutionary theory. But evolution slips into a wild image of degenerative metamorphosis, where all the divisions that Ruskin has so laboriously noted dissolve. Since Ruskin identifies Athena with each seemingly opposed animal signifier in his language of living hieroglyphs, he subverts all linguistic difference and ultimately feminizes signification itself. Through myth Ruskin creates a mutable language, one where genders as well as signs become mobile rather than fixed.<br>

Abstract: In an extensive interview, Rodenbeck responds to questions posed by various colleagues on the significance of travel, travel literature, and cultural encounters. Rodenbeck elaborates his views and his convictions, marked in their unfolding by his encyclopedic knowledge. Starting with a personal narrative, he explores the roots of his fascination by travel and by other cultures and explains how he came to live and teach in Egypt and retire in France. His attitudes towards globalization, orientalism, and typologies of travel are illuminated by examples drawn from historical travelers from different continents and epochs, from his lived experience as an expatriate, and from literary sources. ﻓﻲ ﻫﺬﻩ ﺍﻟﻤﻘﺎﺑﻠﺔ ﺍﻟﻤﺴﻬﺒﺔ٬ ﻳﺠﻴﺐ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﻋﻦ ﺃﺳﺌﻠﺔ ﻋﺪﺩ ﻣﻦ ﺍﻟﺰﻣﻼﺀ ﺣﻮﻝ ﻣﻐﺰﻯ ﺍﻟﺴﻔﺮ٬ ﻭﺃﺩﺏ ﺍﻟﺮﺣﻠﺔ٬ ﻭﺗﻘﺎﻃﻌﺎﺕ ﺍﻟﺜﻘﺎﻓﺎﺕ ﻭﻳﺸﺮﺡ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﺁﺭﺍﺀﻩ ﻭﻣﻌﺘﻘﺪﺍﺗﻪ ﺑﺘﺠﻞ ﹴﻳﻨﻢ ﻋﻦ ﻣﻌﺮﻓﺘﻪ ﺍﻟﻤﻮﺳﻮﻋﻴﺔ٠ ﺑﺎﺩﺋﺎً ﹰ ﺑﺴﺮﺩﻳﺔ ﺷﺨﺼﻴﺔ٬ ﻳﺴﺘﻜﺸﻒ ﺍﻟﻤﺤﺎﻭﹶﺭ ﺟﺬﻭﺭ ﺍﻧﺒﻬﺎﺭﻩ ﺑﺎﻟﺴﻔﺮ ﻭﺍﻟﺜﻘﺎﻓﺎﺕ ﺍﻷﺧﺮﻯ٬ ﺷﺎﺭﺣﺎ ﹰﻛﻴﻒ ﺟﺎﺀ ﻟﻴﻌﻴﺶ ﻭﻳﺪﺭّﺱ ﺑﻤﺼﺮ٬ ﺛﻢ ﻳﺘﻘﺎﻋﺪ ﺑﻌﺪ ﺫﻟﻚ ﻓﻲ ﻓﺮﻧﺴﺎ٠ ﻭﺗﻀﻲﺀ ﺃﻣﺜﻠﺔ ﻋﺪﻳﺪﺓ ﻣﺴﺘﻘﺎﺓ ﻣﻦ ﺭﺣﻠﺔ ﺗﺎﺭﻳﺨﻴﻴﻦ ﻣﻦ ﻗﺎﺭﺍﺕ ﻭﺃﺯﻣﻨﺔ ﻣﺨﺘﻠﻔﺔ٬ ﻭﻣﻦ ﺧﺒﺮﺗﻪ ﻛﺄﺟﻨﺒﻲ ﻣﻐﺘﺮﺏ٬ ﻭﻣﻦ ﺍﻃﻼﻋﺎﺗﻪ ﺍﻷﺩﺑﻴﺔ٬ ﺭﺅﻯ ﺭﻭﺩﻧﺒﻚ ﺣﻮﻝ ﺍﻟﻌﻮﻟﻤﺔ٬ ﻭﺍﻻﺳﺘﺸﺮﺍﻕ٬ ﻭﺃﻧﻤﺎﻁ ﺍﻻﺭﺗﺤﺎﻝ٠<br>

Abstract: Manipulations of time, ranging between moments and centuries, pervade Rogier van der Weyden's Columba Altarpiece. They occur mainly among elements that have been considered forthright iconographic details or unremarkable scenery, including a cityscape, the star of the Magi, a figure among the Magi's followers, and a beggar. While several such temporal expressions find interpretive resonance in Scripture, patristic commentary, and sermons, their collaborative density in the altarpiece contrives a uniquely animated structure of meaning. Among unusual visual alignments that solicit exegetical attention from an observer, precisely charged relationships project backward and forward through history.<br>

Abstract: The combined works of John Dewey and Jerome Bruner provide a framework spanning a century of educational thought which can inform curriculum decisions concerning students' educational development, especially for middle school students whose waning of motivation toward school has been well documented by researchers and has long concerned parents and teachers. This framework, combined with recent contributions of motivation and interest researchers, can create broad understandings of how to collaboratively construct effective educational contexts. As early as 1913, Dewey specifically looked at the pivotal role of students' genuine interests in Interest and Effort in Education. Our current research focus on how students' interest can inform curricular contexts marks the recent shift showing an increased use of interest in education research since 1990. In this article, we discuss our study of a team-taught double classroom of sixth grade students whose interests were determined through a series of brainstorming sessions, and individual and focus group interviews. Students' interests fell into six categories centering around subject areas such as Drama, Science, and Animal Studies. Learning contexts were constructed around four of these subject areas. Students participated in their first or second choice of subject area group. We found significantly higher scores on measures of Affect and Activation if students participated in their first choice group. We found intra-group unities of preferred and dispreferred ways of learning which distinguished each group from the class as a whole. Finally, our findings indicated that students reliably described their genuine interests over time. Students' interests were found to be effective tools for informing curriculum decisions in the creation of sixth grade learning contexts.<br>

Abstract: Since contending methodological perspectives and different types of research products are founded on irreconcilable philosophical assumptions, the sharp, recurrent debates over social science research methods are likely to be fruitless and counterproductive. This article begins by exposing some of the philosophical assumptions underlying the most recent calls for a unified social science methodology and seeks to help develop a common appreciation of how different kinds of methods and research products advance our understanding of different aspects of social life at different levels of abstraction. Such commonly posited dichotomies as deductivist/inductivist logic, quantitative/qualitative analysis, and nomothetic/idiographic research products are shown to obscure significant differences along a continuum of strategies through which context-bound information and analytic constructs are combined to produce interpretations of varying degrees of complexity or generality. Durkheim's conception of "organic solidarity" in a social "division of labor" serves as a useful metaphor here to capture the complementary roles performed by various research products as well as the trade-offs arising from the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches (ranging from formal and statistical approaches to various case-based and interpretive approaches). Thus, sharp claims regarding the strengths and limitations of particular methods are transformed into elements of an overarching agnostic understanding of the trade-offs and complementarities among these methods. Finally, a distinctive role is identified for an ideal-typical "middle-range" comparative-historical approach in fostering greater communication among a more inclusively defined community of methodologically diverse social scientists.<br>

Abstract: Tanto la "novela histórica" como la "novela política" son problemáticas para la crítica. Su complejidad narratológica es grande, pues utilizan varios registros, la historia, la política y la ficción. Este trabajo utiliza las ideas de Genette para elaborar una teoría narratológica general de la novela política que puede servir de método para estudiar textos novelescos de la Guerra Civil Española. Se analizan algunos ejemplos escritos por autores Republicanos y por partidarios Nacionalistas: en todos ellos la semejanza del autor y del narrador es manifiesta y en varios también se distingue cierto parecido entre los tres elementos autor-narrador-personaje.<br>

Abstract: In this article, I seek to make an intervention in debates between psychological and postmodern anthropology by engaging with the theme of border crossing. I argue that the theme of the border is one that fundamentally instantiates a separation between interior and exterior with respect to subjectivity, itself a fundamental transformation and a painful and difficult border. This is related to a Cartesian distinction critiqued in this article. How the distinction between interior and exterior may be transcended is discussed in relation to examples of transformation from the crossing of class borders to the production and regulation of workers in a globalized and neoliberal economy. I begin with reference to postwar transformations of class with its anxious borders and go on to think about changes in the labor market and how these demand huge transformations that tear apart communities, destroy work-places, and sunder the sense of safety and stability that those gave. Advanced liberalism or neoliberalism brings with it a speeding up of the transformations of liberalism in which subjects are constantly invoked as self-contained, with a transportable self that must be produced through the developmental processes of personality and rationality. This self must be carried like a snail carries a shell. It must be coherent yet mutable, fixed yet multiple and flexible. But this view of the subject covers over the many connections that make subjectivity possible. I conclude by asking what it would mean to rethink this issue of the production of safe spaces beyond an essentialist psychological conception of only one mother-child space, separated from the social world, as having the power to produce feelings of safety? I end the article with an argument for a relational approach to subjectivity and sociality.<br>

Abstract: The quest for recognition of subjectivity and human dignity is at the heart of current social activism. Africans have struggled for recognition since they were stripped of human dignity, first by the slave trade and later by colonialism. Their struggle has been revealed essentially through writing and monotheism. This article suggests looking at the performative elaboration of the self. On the continent as well as in the diaspora, the construction of the subjectivity and dignity of the modern African / black person is represented in all its autonomy. The empirical example chosen is that of Central Africa. /// La quête pour la reconnaissance de la subjectivité et la dignité est au coeur des mouvements sociaux actuels. Les Africains se battent pour obtenir la reconnaissance depuis l'époque où la traite des esclaves et plus tard la colonisation les ont dépouillés de leurs qualités humaines. Ces combats ont été essentiellement révélés par l'écriture et le monothéisme. L'article actuel suggère aux lecteurs de considérer la construction performative du moi où la subjectivité Africaine / Noire est représentée dans toute son autonomie. L'exemple empirique proposé est celui de l'Afrique centrale.<br>

Abstract: L'article examine les conceptions de Foucault concernant l'histoire de la vérité, ainsi que les rapports entre la volonté de savoir, la volonté de vérité et les formes du pouvoir. Il rappelle comment les notions nietzschéennes de volonté de vérité et de volonté de puissance font place dans son oeuvre à la volonté de savoir comme instrument des rapports de domination. On examine ensuite comment la notion d'autorité, entendue à la fois au sens institutionnel et au sens discursif, peut permettre une sociologisation des approches traditionnelles de la vérité, élaborées par les philosophes. Comment la visée de vérité du discours s'est-elle combinée historiquement avec la volonté de savoir des institutions ? Y a-t-il différents régimes de vérité, liés à des modalités de discours différentes, mais aussi à des formes d'autorité institutionnelle ? Est-il possible de construire une généalogie des figures de l'autorité discursive ? The paper examines Foucaultian views about the history of truth, as well as the relationships between the will to truth and the different forms of power. It reminds how Nietzsche's conceptions about the will to truth and the will to power are replaced in Foucault's work by the will to truth as a means of power relationships. The paper looks furthermore at the possibility of using the notion of authority, understood both in the institutional and in the discursive sense, as a tool for a sociologization of traditional approaches to truth, constructed by philosophers. How did the pursuit of truth historically combine with the will to knowledge belonging to the institutions ? Are there different regimes of truth, tied to different discursive modalities, as well as to institutional forms of authority ? Is it possible to construct a genealogy of figures of discursive authority ?<br>

Abstract: De 1997 à 2002, eurent lieu la naissance, l'élaboration puis la création par l'Ensemble Modem de Francfort d'un opéra vidéo du compositeur minimaliste américain Steve Reich et de la vidéaste Beryl Korot: Three Tales. Cet opéra était une commande de Klaus Peter Kehr, directeur musical des Wiener Festwochen (Vienne). Sa réalisation mobilisa un important réseau de collaborations aboutissant à un montage financier mené sur la base d'une coproduction de grande ampleur réunissant des festivals européens de création contemporaine de premier rang et deux festivals américains. L'auteur décrit sa démarche, à travers quelques « moteurs de recherche », ainsi que son implication personnelle dans le projet lui-même. The birth, preparation, and actual performance of Three Tales, a video opera signed by Steve Reich, the American minimalist composer, and Beryl Korot, the video-artist, took place between 1997 and 2002, under the aegis of the Frankfurt Modern Ensemble. The opera had been commissioned by Klaus Peter Kehr, musical director of the Wiener Festwochen in Vienna. The project was thus based on a vast collaborative network resulting in an coproduction agreement for funding. This agreement brought together a number of leading European festivals for contemporary creation and two American festivals. The author of the paper describes his research protocol, by way of a certain number of "search engines". He also refers to his own personal involved in the project. Zwischen 1997 und 2002 wurde die Idee zu der Videooper „Three Tales" des minimalistischen Komponisten Steve Reich und des Videokünstlers Beryl Korot vom Modernen Ensemble der Oper Frankfurt umgesetzt. Die Oper war eine Auftragsarbeit des Intendanten der Wiener Festwochen, Klaus Peter Kehr. Ihre Inszenierung konnte finanziell durch ein Netzwerk realisiert werden, einer Kooperation von hochrangigen europäischen und amerikanischen Festivals zeitgenössischer Kunst. Der Autor beschreibt seine persönliche Mitarbeit an dem Projekt und sein Vorgehen anhand einiger „Suchmaschinen“.<br>

Abstract: The proposition is that arts marketing should be conceived of as a dedicated field of endeavour so that consumers' immersion in the artistic experience occurs even in the case of a "difficult" art work. The focus is artistic experience-related phenomena. The authors introduce the concept of appropriation and then develop an appropriation cycle construct. Empirical research comprises introspective reports on consumer attendance at classical music concerts. The results show that the artistic experience is predicated on multiple rather than one-time immersion, and that full immersion may never occur. The authors conclude that those service elements that affect the way in which consumers experience an arts event should be managed throughout the appropriation process. Les auteurs proposent de concevoir le marketing des arts comme un domaine d'activité spécifique, afin que l'immersion des consommateurs dans l'expérience artistique soit possible même dans le cas d'une œuvre « difficile » . L'accent est mis sur les phénomènes liés à l'expérience artistique. Ils présentent le concept d'appropriation, puis développent un construit du cycle d'appropriation. Ils ont recours à la recherche empirique, soit les rapports d'analyse introspective des consommateurs ayant assisté à des concerts de musique classique. Les résultats indiquent que l'expérience artistique suppose de multiples immersions, non pas une seule, et que l'immersion totale risque de ne jamais se produire. Les auteurs concluent que les éléments du service qui influent sur l'expérience individuelle d'un événement artistique devraient être gérés tout au long du processus d'appropriation. Los autores proponen la idea de que el márketing de las artes debe concebirse como un emprendimiento en sí mismo, a fin de lograr la inmersión del consumidor en experiencia artística incluso en el caso de obras de arte "difíciles". El acento, entonces, está puesto en los fenómenos que se vinculan con la experiencia artística. Los autores presentan el concepto de apropiación y elaboran luego un modelo teórico de ciclo de apropiación. Por otra parte, analuzan los resultados de uno investigación empírica basada sobre los relatos introspectivos realizados por consumidores luego de asistir a conciertos de música clásica. Dichos resultados indican que la experienca artística toma forma con múltiples inmersiones y no sólo con una, y que la inmersión total puede no darse jamás. Los autores llegan a la conclusión de que el proceso de apropiación es el abordaje más idóneo para manejar aquellos elemontos del servicio que afectan la forma en que el consumidor experimenta un evento artístico.<br>

Abstract: Tout au long de l'histoire de la psychologie, la revolution cognitive n'a pas cessé de progresser. Celle qui a cours aujourd'hui cherche à expliquer comment les individus parviennent a donner des significations au monde complexe qui les entoure : il est temps à présent de comprendre différents modes d'élaboration du sens. Quatre modes distincts sont suggérés. Le premier, le mode intersubjectif, concerne l'établissement, le façonnement et le maintien de l'intersubjectivité. Le deuxième, le mode actionnel, concerne l'organisation de l'action. Le troisième, le mode normatif, intègre les éléments particuliers dans des contextes normatifs et s'exprime en imposant des contraintes aux deux premiers modes. Les trois modes ont en commun d'être fortement dépendants du contexte: Les narratifs — ou les récits — sont l'instrument par excellence permettant d'ancrer les trois premiers modes d'élaboration du sens dans un ensemble plus structuré. On peut supposer que le quatrième mode d'élaboration du sens, le mode propositionnel, vise à décontextualiser les trois modes précédents en les soumettant à la vérification et aux justifications logiques. Throughout the entire history of cognitive psychology, a cognitive revolution has always been in progress. The current cognitive revolution began to explain how individuals come to make meaning out of a complex world ; it now needs to turn more vigorously to different forms of meaning making. Four modes are suggested. The first one is directed to the establishment, shaping and maintenance of intersubjectivity. A second form, the actional mode, is concerned with the way action is organized. The third form, the normative mode, construes particulars in normative contexts ; it expresses itself by imposing constraints on the first two modes. These three modes of meaning making have in common to be context dependent. Narratives or stories are the vehicles par excellence for entrenching the first three modes into a more structured whole. It is suggested that the fourth mode of meaning making, the propositional mode, is directed to the decontextualization of the preceeding three modes by imposing verifiability and logical justification. A brief account of how this set of meaning making processes might have grown out of human evolution is discussed. In conclusion : no reductionist theory on mind will do it proper justice.<br>

Abstract: Les processus complexes et souvent paradoxaux que l'alternance met en jeu chez l'apprenant se révèlent de possibles points d'appui des apprentissages signifiants. Une pédagogie qui ne tente pas de les éliminer amène alors à concevoir le travail de l'enseignant comme un travail de médiation elle aussi paradoxale. Une telle conception de l'alternance, loin d'enfermer celle-ci dans un rapport sclérosant à la tradition et sans pour autant l'en couper, montre en quoi l'articulation d'espaces et de temps contradictoires peut être pédagogiquement dynamique. Ce qui, en retour, ne manque pas d'interroger l'enseignement/apprentissage dans l'école dite traditionnelle. Complex and often paradoxical processes elaborated by the learner in an alternation situation may help realizing relevant learning. When pedagogy doesn't try to eliminate them, teacners'work can be conceived of as a mediation activity equally paradoxical. In such a conception, alternation is not separated from tradition but not blocked by it either. It shows to what extend links between contradictory spaces and periods of time may be educationally dynamic. Which, in return, asks questions concerning teaching/learning in a traditional school.<br>

Abstract: As most European societies have struggled to find a consensus for working up their World War Two past, former forced labourers often had to endure ensuing societal initiatives to suppress or instrumentalise their memories or to see them tied to overreaching political or ethical imperatives. This article tries to trace the whereabouts of these memories in societal and individual perspectives. First, forced labour in Nazi Germany can be seen as part of a forced migration experience. Second, the memories of Nazi forced labour have often been used to represent the experiences of collaboration and defeat in World War Two in the respective countries. Third, national political and moral economies have shaped the societal status of former forced labourers' memories. These memories have hardly found their proper place in most of the respective national pasts.<br>

Abstract: As oral historians, we devote a great deal of time to painstakingly designing our projects, cognizant of the fact that our research requires us to interact with human beings in often intimate ways. For this same reason, though, our careful methodology and meticulously designed projects are constantly being tested. This article is a reflection on some of the ethical and methodological challenges that the authors faced during their life story interviews with Holocaust survivors in Montreal, Canada. In particular, it explores three major themes: the elaborate process of learning to "share authority" and build trust with interviewees; the limitations of "deep listening" and their implications; and the struggle to deal with contentious politics, such as perceived racism, that emerged out of some interviews. Reflection on these methodological and ethical challenges not only opens up a wider and important discussion among researchers about how practice relates to theory but also teaches us about our interviewees. For example, what does an interviewee's refusal to engage deeply about his or her past tell us about how they formed their identity in the aftermath of mass violence? Challenges, such as this one, are part of the story. They shed light on questions of narrative formation, the identity politics that result from survival, and how individual memory interacts with dominant narratives about atrocity. They force us to recognize that both our interviewees—and ourselves—are human beings, and not just collections of stories.<br>

Abstract: This paper is about the analysis of the written production of argumentative discourse. Thanks to the technique of collective writing it is possible to observe the process of discourse production. Declarative, strategic and procedural abilities of two non native adults are successively analyzed and compared periodically to those of two young native speakers. This study focuses on only two levels : global and interphrasal organisation of discourse. The organisation of debates in class so as to bring students to build argumentative concepts and help them in their approach of texts (reading and writing) shows the limits of a didactic scheme which relies on oral language practice for the elaboration of written texts.<br>

Abstract: This study examines how deadlines and time limits for conference talks organize the discourse of consensus among collaborating experimental and theoretical physicists in a university laboratory. Six months of videotaped observations, including two cycles of conference talk preparation, indicate that, as the date of an upcoming conference nears, several things happen. (a) Co-authoring physicists usually have not achieved agreement on all aspects of the findings. (b) They nevertheless direct their energies to constructing a hybrid presentation rhetoric that satisfies the co-authors and fits the talk to the official conference talk time limit. (c) In the process of working through matters of rhetoric -- what to say, what to display visually, what to leave out, and in what order the information should be presented -- the physicists construct a working consensus on matters of physics: theory and experimental data explaining the properties and dynamics of the physical universe.<br>

Abstract: The article discusses the presence of emancipatory Utopian ideas in Ethiopian history through a critical hermeneutical interpretation of Lalibela. Drawing on the concept of concrete utopia, the paper argues that the works and Chronicles of Lalibela secrete a concrete Utopian surplus that points to the conceptualization of knowledge as critique and as die mastery of nature, of labor as a transformative and emancipatory acüvity, and of power relations as expressions of equality between subjects and ruler. The article contends that Lalibelas Utopian surplus implies questions and reflections about social transformation, which, being rooted in Ethiopian history, provide possibilities for developing emancipatory ideas and practices that respond to the modern needs and aspirations of Ethiopians. It argues that, if Ethiopia u to extricate herself from the poverty and tyranny traps of passive modernization and successfully meet the challenges of modernity, reflection on and the quest for democracy and prosperity need to link up with the concrete Utopian surpluses that inform Ethiopian history.<br>

Abstract: This essay examines the manner in which Peter Singer exceeds the boundaries of ethical reasoning in arguing his position on life ethics. Specifically, it probes a narrative aesthetic that functions as rhetorical proof in his work. Attention is given to demonstrating the presence of ironic aesthetics in this narrative. Thereafter two conceptual structures—consubstantiality and ironic catharsis—are elaborated in order to show how Singer uses irony in an attempt to shape audience attitudes toward the traditional life ethics position.<br>

Abstract: An increasing number of individuals worldwide are receiving home nursing care from loved ones. Many healthcare professionals are exploring the use of narrative to help family caregivers meet the personal demands of this work. Citing Ricoeur's notion of narrative identity as a social process in which cultural norms and values are negotiated between speaker and audience, this paper argues that health care professionals can assist their clients by viewing narrative as collaboration, not autonomous construction. Collaboration in construction of narrative identity was observed in interactions between family caregivers and public health workers on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. There, caregivers were supported by a dialogic process in which interlocutors explored the cultural values that define and delimit the possibilities for living as caregivers.<br>

Abstract: A theory of the embodiment of action is proposed. Reflections on relations between human intentions, the human body and the notion of agency lead us to argue that phenomenological analysis is not sufficient for such a theory. Our consideration, that the most fundamental level of embodied agency is that of life itself, brings us to the philosophy of biology and the theory of the organism: briefly, certain parts of the natural environment are intrinsic to the constitution of organisms and, in their more sophisticated configuration, as agents. Action is embodied in the sense that certain physiological processes are internal in relation to it and play a constitutive role in its performance. The way in which environment, context and consciousness affect and constitute the nature of agency at personal and sub-personal levels is elaborated. We see that human agents perceive and act upon their world through a complex shifting between those levels. A summary of the ways in which the social sciences can be enriched by this more comprehensive view of human agency provides the basis of justification for claiming Actor-Network Theory (ANT), originally developed by sociologists studying science and technology, as a promising framework for the continuation of this reasoning.<br>

Abstract: This article focuses on a close reading of Rey Ventura's autobiographical narrative of his experience as an illegal migrant worker in Japan in order to unsettle the dominant paradigm of the overseas Filipino worker as hero(ine) and martyr. It examines the ways in which both the Philippine and Japanese states have acted as apparatuses of labor capture; the various discourses of nationness which inform the political construction of the OFW as "labor," "foreign," "illegal" and "depoliticized"; and the strategies of survival used by OFWs to negotiate with, and make claims on, the labor-sending and -receiving states.<br>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the ways in which people who work in and use a cancer genetics clinic in the UK talk about the 'gene for cancer'. By conceptualizing such a gene as a boundary object, and using empirical data derived from clinic consultations, observations in a genetics laboratory and interviews with patients, the author seeks to illustrate how the various parties involved adopt different discursive strategies to appropriate, describe and understand what is apparently the 'same' thing. The consequent focus on the ways in which the rhetorical and syntactical features of lay and professional talk interlink and diverge illustrates not merely how our contemporary knowledge of genes and genetics is structured, but also how different publics position themselves with respect to the biochemistry of life.<br>

Abstract: L'expresivité phonologigue de la langue poétique tchèque Nous disposons aujourd'hui de preuves suffisantes pour croire au bien fondé du symbolisme phonétique véritable. Selon les oeuvres cités de Jakobson, Fónagy et Žuravlev on peut donc considérer comme acquis le fait que certaines significations sont naturellement attachées à certains sons et que tout phonème lorsqu'il est réalisé peut se charger de symbolisme par référence à isa nature articulatoire et acoustique. Le but de ce travail est de créer le point de départ objectif a l'interprétation phonostylistique du symbolisme phonétique des sons tchèques. L'auteur suit la doctrine de la méthode psychosémantique, il utilise la différentielle sémantique et présente a 40 sujets tchèques les phonème de leur langue maternelle. Jiráček prouve la validité de son approche par la confrontation des résultats parmi dix groupes des sujets tchèques a 40 personnes. Les résultats de l'ensemble de 400 sujets ont montré des facultés considérables des phonèmes tchèques pour l'expressivité phonologigue univoque. Ala fin de son étude l'auteur cherche d mettre en relation ses constatations scientifiques avec le domaine de la langue poétique tchèque. Il crée les points de départ a la comprehension automatique de la composition des sons du vers. Il donne naissance (en collaboration avec L. Popelinský) du programme automatique de cette analyse du vers et son fonctionnement présente sur la traduction du poème de Paul Verlaine.<br>

Abstract: Ethnomethodology captures ordinary events in ways that retain their dynamic and collaborative character. Ethnomethodologists identify people's methods for developing a practical objectivity that can render their local affairs meaningful and orderly, and they closely scrutinize the local details of mundane affairs in order to describe how a local cohort of cooperating parties concert themselves in providing an intelligibility for their social interaction, local work that is naturally occurring and depends upon the reflexive character of any emerging sense.<br>

Abstract: If human beings were empirically shown to be irrational, would this finding destroy the foundations of economic science? We think not because we doubt that this postulate is needed as a foundation of economic science. We examine the laboratory experiments conducted by behavioral economists and experimental psychologists on human judgment and decision-making, using Bayes' Theorem and the Expected Value model We examine a number of issues: Can we base ourselves on experimenters' full rationality for doubting of human rationality? Are rational models anything else than handy tools? Do humans' minds function like rational tools or with rational tools? How an "irrational" human being could create anything "rational"? Should rationality be subordinated to reason? Nature being neither rational nor irrational, is there any point in applying the concept of rationality to one its constituents? If human beings were rational forms of life, would this specie have survived?<br>

Abstract: Studies of laboratory research in the natural sciences have shown the significance of crossexperimenter dialogue in the determination of scientific facts. Behavioral and social scientists have largely ignored that role in the construction of scientific facts. A dialogic data base differs epistemogically from strict behavioral observations because of its retroductive and dialectic character. Its symbolic nature calls for hermeneutic efforts designed to achieve and assess consensual rather than empirical validation. Its ultimate aim is social organization rather than prediction and control. In view of this distinction, experimental research of human behavior must show the integration of the empirical and dialogic bases of behavioral data so as to more accurately reflect its constructive nature.<br>

Abstract: This paper examines key implications of praxis theory for applied anthropology. I am concerned with applied anthropology as a communicative and collaborative process and with a critical understanding of the anthropologist's role as consultant, practitioner, and analyst in processes of planned change. The use of praxis as a central analytic leitmotif places "practical" activity, informed by theory, at the center of applied research. The analysis is illustrated through a description of a multi-disciplinary, community-based health research and planning project in seven native communities in Ontario. I examine how practical knowledge and action constrains and transforms academic models of community based development.<br>

Abstract: This article explores how the concept of ecosystem ecologies, one of the most influential models of systems thinking, was developed in relation to the radioactive aftermath of US nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific Islands. Historian Richard Grove has demonstrated how tropical island colonies all over the globe served as vital laboratories and spaces of social, botanical, and industrial experiment in ways that informed modernity and the conservation movement. I propose a similar relationship between the militarized American island colonies of Micronesia and how their constitution as AEC laboratories contributed to both atomic modernity and the field of ecosystem ecology. This was enacted through metaphorical concepts of island isolation and distributed visually by Atomic Energy Commission films that upheld an aerial vision of the newly acquired atolls for an American audience. Finally, the myth of isolation is also at work in the ways in which Marshall Islanders exposed to nuclear fallout became human subjects for radiation experiments due to the idea of the biological isolate.<br>

Abstract: Les mathématiques, auxquelles on peut joindre la logique, et depuis 1960 une large part de l'informatique théorique, fournissent un témoignage sur une part essentielle du fonctionnement de l'esprit humain. Loin de fournir seulement des outils extérieurs, elles se sont faites mode de pensée nécessaire pour appréhender la réalité physique. Elles nous ont appris que ce que nous nommons raison, démarche rationnelle, est en réalité laborieusement construit. Un bref survol de l'histoire des mathématiques, anciennes, puis surtout depuis le XIXe s., montre en quel sens le concept ancien de « vérité scientifique » s'en trouve désormais modifié. Mathematics, to which one may add logic and, since 1960, a large section of theoretical computer technique, all furnish evidence concerning an essential part of the working of the human mind. Far from providing only external tools, they have evolved as a necessary mode of thought for the understanding of physical reality. They have taught us that what we call reason, or rational deduction, is in fact something we have ourselves laboriously constructed. A brief survey of the history of mathematics, ancient and modern but especially from and after the 19th century, shows ways in which the old concept of a 'scientific truth' must henceforth be modified.<br>

Abstract: This paper challenges the common assumption that the attention which modern literary theory pays to the textual aspects of literature is achieved at the expense of humanistic and moral concerns. It starts by outlining how modern literary theory differs epistemologically from the traditional critical approaches to literature. Traditional critical theory was developed in the defense of poetry against Plato's accusations, real or imagined, and this informed both its critical practice and its concept of man. It established its epistemology on an aesthetic, moral, social, philosophical or scientific basis in a manner that encumbered literature with the concepts of man inherent in them. In contrast, modern literary theory started from a different premise: instead of seeking to justify literature and its moral relevance, it strove to identify its literariness and the dynamics of its structure by using the disciplines of semiotics and linguistics. It posited the text as an autonomous entity and a complete structure aware of its existence in a society of texts with which it conducts a profoundly intertextual dialogue. As an autonomous structure, the literary work is independent of other social or philosophical constructs and thus capable of conducting a meaningful dialogue with them. The paper elaborates the various conceptual frameworks of Russian formalism, intertextuality, structuralism and deconstruction in order to examine their implicit assumptions about man. It shows how the autonomous and dialogical nature of the literary work in its Bakhtinian sense are relevant to the concept of man inherent in modern literary theory. In its elaboration of this concept, the paper shows how it was developed in conflict with the hierarchical nature of traditional, ethical and philosophical values. It illustrates also the relevance of autonomy, self-regulation, free-play and fair representation inherent in many concepts of modern literary theory to the question of human rights. The question of human rights in modern literary theory is closely connected to its concept of the "subject"; the paper outlines Barthes' concept of the centrality of the human subject and Derrida's concept of différance and its impact on his understanding of the concept of the subject. With Derrida's différance, which means both difference and deferral, it became impossible to talk about the concept of the "subject" in isolation from that of the "other," whether one is dealing with the national aspects of the subject or with its gender issues. The deconstruction of the concept of the "subject" brings into the fore the omitted, marginalised and neglected aspects pertinent to its composition and accentuates both the processes of difference and deferral inherent in it. The representation of the subject implies its difference from, and indeed suppression of, the other. It also shows how Derrida's concept of différance dealt a devastating blow to the various philosophical absolutes and social hierarchies which controlled our thinking. The paper then examines the implications of these new critical and philosophical concepts for two different "others": the similar other within the culture (women) and the different other, the stranger/outsider to the dominant Western culture. It demonstrates how modern literary theory helped women to liberate themselves from cultural oppression by deconstructing patriarchal binary thinking and its inherent bias against women and so consolidate their human rights. It limits itself in this domain to a discussion of the contribution of French feminist literary theory, particularly the work of Hélèn Cixous, Luce Irigaray and Julia Kristeva. Their work shows how the literary, philosophical and critical canon perpetuated patriarchy and oppressed women. As for the different other, the paper refers to the work of Edward Said in his deconstruction of Orientalism and its discourse which subjects the other to the demands, needs and visions of the Western "self" and sacrifices in the process his identity and human rights. It also studies the work of the African American critic Henry Louis Gates and shows how his attempt to develop a literary theory based on, and deriving its conceptual framework from, the literature of African and Afro-American writers played a significant role in liberating the African American, undermining their biased representation in the culture, and upholding their human rights.<br>

Abstract: «At the basis of the literary act is a consciousness of language. Whether or not the writer is given to abstract reflexion, there is in literature itself a metaliterary dimension.» In his article on the Evolution of Literary Theory, Tzvetan Todorov examines the relation between the «discourse on Literature» and the object of that discourse: literature. Whereas exegesis concerns itself with the Elucidation and explanation of an historically given object, theory itself constitutes its object. Theory then is in turn seen to be historically informed. From the Poetics of Aristotle, through the medieval hermeneuts, the Renaissance concern with genres, Todorov traces the development of the theoretical discourse which proposes literature as its object. Only in the romantic period is a theory of literature, in the strict sense, elaborated. In the 20th century this theory is further influenced by other emergent disciplines :Marxism, psychoanalysis etc. The final pages of Todorov's paper consider in detail the impact of structuralism, particularly in France, on the literary theoretical discourse. He concludes with reference to the changes taking place currently. According to Todorov, it is in the «idea of genre» that the «transformation will take place.»<br>

Abstract: This paper is an advocacy for the employment of psychoanalytical concepts within sociological theorizing about the individual. Through an exposition of Freud's views on the development of intra-psychic structure and a critique of Parson's reduction of psychoanalysis to a branch of learning theory, I attempt to show that the sociological approach to the individual is implicitly behavioural and imprisoned in a series of assumptions which, among other things, treats subjectivity as epiphenomenal and identity as an unmediated reflection of some external reality. In contrast, psychoanalysis presents to us a picture of the individual as flawed and ambivalent in his relation to society, formed by but at odds with the demands of culture. In particular, the psychoanalytic concept of identification reveals that the acquisition of identity is a hard-won achievement marked by the renunciation of lost and forbidden objects. I argue, following Freud and Lacan, that the ego, far from being an agency of reason, somehow directly 'plugged into' reality, constitutes itself in the fantasied image of another and that the quality of this identification crucially affects the way the world is experienced and believed by the individual. This argument is elaborated through a discussion of Peter Berger's remarks on the social causes of identity crisis which, when set against the work of object-relations theorists on those suffering from disturbances of identity such as, for example, schizoid personalities, are shown to be both superficial and misleading. I conclude the paper by arguing that while psychoanalysis can enhance our understanding of the way in which the individual is formed by and through culture it also cautions us against making simple generalizations about the impact of culture upon the person, showing that the individual never submits himself unequivocally to its demands and interdicts.<br>

Abstract: Deconstruction has become a theme in various strands of geographical research. It has not, however, been the subject of much explicit commentary. This paper elaborates on some basic themes concerning the relationship between deconstruction and conceptualizations of context, with particular reference to issues of textual interpretation. The double displacement of textuality characteristic of deconstruction is discussed, followed by a consideration of the themes of 'writing' and 'iterability' as distinctive figures for an alternative spatialization of concepts of context. It is argued that deconstruction informs a questioning of the normative assumptions underwriting the value and empirical identity of context.<br>

Abstract: Using a broadly Aristotelian framework I propose poetic form as a means for distinguishing historicities. I analyze Sakalava performances of possession by royal ancestors as the creative production of a kind of history, distinguish it from a dominant occidental model of history, and elaborate the chronotope on which it is based and the heteroglossia and historical consciousness it enables. I argue that Sakalava spirit possession has a strongly realist bent and suggest the interest of poiesis for anthropological analysis and comparison more generally.

Abstract: The field of bioethics has been dominated by the tenets and assumptions of Western philosophical rationalistic thought. A principles and rights-based approach to discussions of moral dilemmas has sustained and reinforced a pervasive reductionism, utilitarianism, and ethnocentrism in the field. Recent explorations of casuistry and hermeneutics suggest a movement toward an expanded theoretical and conceptual framing of medical ethical problems. Increased attention to moral phenomenology and a recognition of the importance of social, cultural, and historical determinants that shape moral questioning should facilitate collaborative work between anthropologists and ethicists. In this article, I examine the philosophical orientation of U.S. bioethics and the relationship of the social sciences to the field of medical ethics. Deterrents to collaboration between anthropologists and bioethicists are explored. Finally, I review past and possible future contributions of anthropology to the field of bioethics and, more generally, to medical ethics.<br>

Abstract: To date, little is known about when and to what degree science students begin to participate in authentic scientific graphing practices. This article presents the results of a series of studies on the production, transformation, and interpretation of graphical representation from Grade 8 to professional scientific practice both in formal testing situations (inside) and in the course of field/laboratory work (outside). The results of these studies can be grouped into two major areas. First, there is a discontinuity in the graph-related practices that marks a boundary between people who engage in work that requires them to transform data into graphical representations (converted) and people who do not have such experiences (cannibals). Second, the didactic practices of high school textbooks and university lectures exhibit a marked discontinuity relative to graphing practices in scientific journals. Graphs used in didactic circumstances may be associated with students' difficulties in interpreting "real data." It appears that school teachers and university professors (missionaries) do little to put their students on trajectories of increasing participation in authentic scientific graphing practices.<br>

Abstract: The new information technologies have transformed reading practices in meaningful ways, promoting other skills and competences, and activating new ways of interacting with reading devices. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Mexico City, this article aims to explore how communicational innovations have had an impact on a specific type of reader, whose distinctive feature is to have an intense and/or enjoyable relationship with the act of read: the cultural creators. The analysis of these practices and the reflection as a result of this, allows us to observe that, far from creating isolated readers, the emerging technologies contribute to develop, in other ways,the potential for the sociability of reading, thus stimulating work networks and collaborative projects.<br>

Abstract: Cet article est issu d'une étude ethnographique menée à l'Université de Cape Town. Il explore la dynamique d'une intervention permettant au personnel de l'université de s'engager dans une voie alternative à celle de l'apartheid en Afrique du Sud. Il traite de la politique sociale qui apparut entre l'intervention, ses participants et non-participants imaginaires par rapport à la vision « transformatrice » de l'université. L'intention des interventionnistes a été retravaillée par les participants des principaux symboles qui mettent en forme les motifs de leurs comportements et donnent un sens à leurs expériences. Utilisant le modèle d'Ortner (1973) de reconnaissance et de symboles-clés, je soutiens que la « transformation » et « l'espace sûr » représentent une élaboration symboles, en ce sens qu'ils ont le pouvoir d'action et d'élaboration conceptuelle. Ces symboles d'élaboration fonctionnent en relais avec une sorte de logique qui « cristallise l'engagement » des participants vers l'intervention d'une manière émotionnellement puissante et relativement indifférenciée. Ce faisant, ils font de l'intervention un symbole capable d'exprimer ce que leur expérience signifie pour eux en tant que communauté imaginée par rapport aux autres.<br>

Abstract: Evaluative terms are a crucial part of the environmental discourse. These terms, and the evaluative frameworks in which they are imbedded, serve as important guides to action. “Natural,” a term commonly used as a positive evaluation, is problematic because it can both justify unfair social relations and obscure the connections between humans and the rest of nature. “Sustainable,” another popular term, is extremely malleable, and is too often elaborated in frameworks that are neither socially nor ecologically responsible. The term “sustainable” is sometimes used in the framework of ecosystem health, but even this approach can fail to highlight the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. The framework of ecosocial flourishing, introduced in this article, is better suited for highlighting the interconnected nature of the world and for drawing attention to questions of environmental justice. Evaluative terms (like “natural”) and frameworks (like “ecosocial flourishing”) are part of larger narratives that help people make sense of their interactions with, and emotional responses to, the non-human world.<br>

Abstract: Offering a “pharmacological” perspective, this essay elaborates on the Chilean Roberto Bolaño's novel
         2666. It discusses narrative imaginaries that regraph cultural experiences and spaces of self-consciousness as they emerge from singular global south networks. In2666, the Mexican-U.S. border region operates as a fraught site through which a global aesthetics of sobriety gains shape and texture, a phenomenon upon which Bolaño's text depends for its critique of Western academic knowledge. From there, I consider how a “pharmacological” problematization of Western culture can reshape our perspective of the constitution of a global modernity.<br>

Abstract: Some time ago, Paul Ricoeur pointed out that “the symbol gives rise to thought.”
      
               These diasporic religious communities enable us to find a new beginning for thought that has the possibility of avoiding the exclusivity and elitism that has too often accompanied the objective meaning of thought as a science of the rational. Not only these diasporic religions, but also the very conundrum of the continent of Africa as a whole, to echo Skinner at the beginning of our paper, may serve in the same manner as one of the most important ways that thought might be renewed—and the relationship of thought to action and performance.38<br>

Abstract: Our plight, then, is not simply that we are all in the same boat, let alone on the same ocean. Yet we are still bound by the responsbility of inhabiting the same planet. What would it mean, then, to share the earth with all its inhabitants, not just in terms of occupying the same planet but also in terms of caring and looking after each other in the anachronistic sense of the word
   dutyas plight? Can we risk pledging to solemnly avow our own investments in the very things we so self-rightousely protest against, not in order to stop protesting in the name of justice but, rather, in the hopes of turning the killing machine back against itself and taking another step toward “hunting down” and abolishing death penalities wherever they may be hiding, even in our own disowned fears and desires?<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Abstract: We at SPEP have never been modern and have made a good living off the critique of modernism and of its binary oppositions. But I think that the business as usual of Continental philosophy will have to be expanded to include a critique of the opposition of the human and the nonhuman, of
            physisandtechne, and of “Continental philosophy” and “science.” For the truth is that we have been a party to the science wars. That is why I think that the work of Catherine Malabou is exactly the sort of work that SPEP and Continental philosophy generally will have to do in the future.
                  We have yet to admit how deeply inscribed the human is in the nonhuman and the technical. We have yet to appreciate that being-in-the-world is not only historicized, gendered, and incarnate but also both a neural and a galactic event, of both microscopic and macroscopic proportions. Can it be of no interest to “philosophy,” can there be nothing to “wonder” about, that our bodies are literally made of stardust? We have yet to realize how deeply interwoven is the imagination of speculative physics with the wonder of the philosophers. If the best we can do is to protect our turf by saying that science does not think, the sciences will steal our thunder, that is, our wonder, right out from under us. Science does think, and science wonders, because wonder is the piety of thought. That is a matter to which SPEP, and Continental philosophers generally, whether they have taken a theological turn or are running in the opposite direction, should give more thought.36

Abstract: Adopting a hyperbolic perspective is also certainly a way to argue as well as a way to examine other “texts” because it is a trope and figure of thought that reveals those moments within discourse when one is attempting to transcend the bounds of reality because the extraordinary nature of a given situation or subject matter requires the use of an excessive prophetic voice or an ardent polemical exaggeration. As Mileur posits, “The work is a hyperbole, the intersection of other hyperboles, and the subject is, insofar as he can be written about at all, another hyperbole” (1990, 86). Rather than circumventing it, understanding hyperbole as the focus of thought and action can create significant moments of
      inventioas well aselocutiofor the hyperbolist and critic alike. By approaching a particular text, a critical term, and even a piece of criticism itself from a hyperbolic perspective, one might (re)consider and (re)interpret these “texts” as a stretching of discursive limits that leads one toward a re-presentation of the extraordinary—an attempt to communicate the ineffable or transgress the expressible.<br>

Abstract: Second, how do we account for the fact that the processes of public memory are both created by individual choices and nurtured in collective contexts? Many scholars have productively addressed this question by unpacking specific examples in which individuals or groups vie to control public memories. The critical framework I recommend offers a more systematic approach to this issue. To view representations of the past through the nested lenses of rhetoric, public memory, and the agential spiral is to focus on how human beings—individually and in groups—forge connections with people of other times through the medium of public agency. The agential spiral, derived from my reading of Ricoeur's “threefold mimesis,” aims to pinpoint three moments in the construction of narratives in which human action is represented and reinterpreted within a temporal structure. As a critical framework, the agential spiral helps us to view the creation of public memories at three key moments and to see the process as a coiling whole. Using this tool, we can better understand why certain memories persist in certain societies and how those memories powerfully connect people across time as well as space.<br>

Abstract: Moreover, for Shaw and Ricoeur, imaginative works of art have the power to project alternative and potentially redemptive ways of living together harmoniously, which in turn can substantially change hearts, alter beliefs, and reorient behavior in an empathetic direction that promotes vigilant concern for the other. Be they biblical narratives, plays for the stage, fictions for the page, or other forms of literary texts broadly construed, stories can portray freedom and fault reconciled in compassionate beings committed to advancing the common good. In this way, poetic making can and has instilled in us not only faith and hope but magnanimity as well. Thus, the answer to the provocative question Shaw poses at the beginning of his last major treatise,
      Everybody's Political What's What?—“Is Human Nature Incurably Depraved?”
               —is a resounding no: not just for him but for Ricoeur, too. Where there is faith, there is hope; and where there is hope, there is life. Life expectant.55<br>

Abstract: Milan Kundera has described this kind of comedy as echoing a joyous, life-affirming laughter—“the serious laughter of angels expressing their joy of being.”
      
               But that is not to suggest that there is anything divinely pious in this position: if Joyce is an angel, then he is one, like Stephen Dedalus, who will not blindly or uncritically serve.168
            
               In commenting upon an earlier version of this article, Patrick Parrinder spoke of “the difficult relationship between Utopia and comedy.” This relationship is problematized by the fact that Utopia rarely seems able to laugh at itself or therefore to offer the liberating possibilities of comedy. Joyce's later writing, however, appears to advance the rare chance of a pluralist, ambiguous, and dynamic vision of Utopia: a Utopia that might be sustained into futurity—a Utopia that still has room for dreamers and for democrats. But is it still possible that we can call this realm of radical openness, this flux of possibilities, this resolutely material site, Utopian? And do we really need to? This kind of Utopia is not a category or a frame but a direction, a progress, a confluence of streams of consciousness and of unconsciousness, flowing into the river of life: not just a symbolic river but a real one too, the Liffey, the great Anna Livia Plurabelle herself. Or as Joyce put it, more succinctly (and more joyously), it is simply “Lff!”169

Abstract: It is in this sense that Utopia can be understood as
      lying before us—in both senses of this confounding double phrase. Utopia resides in the past (beforein this instance means “behind us”) inasmuch as any reconsideration of Utopia in the present must inevitably begin with the past. But if the sources of Utopia in the present reside in the past, realization is in the future (beforein this instance means “ahead of us”). It is this double valence that links the articles that make up this special issue. Some deal with historical figures, literature, or places, while others take up analogous considerations that are closer to us now. However, in each case, the future is what is at issue: What shape will it take? How might the circumstances of its emergence be as propitious as possible? These key questions suffuse all of the articles that follow and are of the greatest urgency to all disciplines but in particular for architecture and urbanism, which are burdened with providing the stage upon which we play out the drama of our lives, individually and collectively.<br>

Abstract: Flush with the juices of adolescence, American philosophy declared independence from its European parentage in the work of Ralph Waldo Emerson and his generation. In 1837, Emerson addressed the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society on the occasion of its inaugural meeting for the year, which he called a "holiday." Emerson began: I greet you on the recommencement of our literary year. Our anniversary is one of hope, and, perhaps, not enough of labor. We do not meet for games of strength or skill, for the recitation of histories, tragedies, and odes, like the ancient Greeks; for parliaments of love and poesy, like the Troubadours; nor for the advancement of science, like our contemporaries in the British and European capitals. Thus far, our holiday has been simply a friendly sign of the survival of the love of letters amongst a people too busy to give letters any more. Perhaps the time is already come when it ought to be, and will be something else; when the sluggard intellect of this continent will look from under its iron lids and fill the postponed expectations of the world with something better than the expectations of mechanical skill. Our day of dependence, our long apprenticeship to the learning of other lands, draws to a close. The millions that around us are rushing into life, cannot always be fed on the sere remains of foreign harvests. Events, actions arise, that must be sung, that will sing themselves.<br>

Abstract: R.A. Lafferty's reputation for rollicking humor and poetic verve, as demonstrated in such stories as “Narrow Valley” (1966) and “Slow Tuesday Night” (1965) belies the considerable theoretical and narratological complexity of his entire body of work. This article draws on the vocabulary developed by Paul Ricoeur in
         Interpretation Theory(1966) andTime and Narrative(1983–85) to explore Lafferty's process of world creation in light of his startling 1979 announcement that the cognitive world of humanity had come to an end. Thus, in this post-conscious state, it was left to science fiction to develop potential replacements. In his writings Lafferty seeks not only to project new worlds but also to reconstruct the world-building capacity in others, enabling readers and writers alike to collaborate toward a future for humanity.<br>

Abstract: The article focuses on the role of the “Survey on Regional Architecture in Portugal” in 1955 and its effects on contemporary Portuguese architecture. A photographic survey organizes and indexes a group of buildings with precise criteria, allowing a general panorama. In fact these built-environment, large-scale archives play an important role in heritage preservation. In the 1930s, an interesting phenomenon gathered architects who, although committed to the modern movement and enthusiasts of industrial progress, showed a growing interest in vernacular buildings and settlements. Some of these architects became photographers, attentive to a pre-industrial world that was endangered, to record timeless architecture and expose new aesthetic values. This interest generated several movements centered on an appreciation of regional architecture. Along with nostalgia, there stood out the feeling that there were still many lessons to be drawn from these threatened vernacular structures.<br>
