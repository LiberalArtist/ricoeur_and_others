  Book Title: Intimate Domain-Desire, Trauma, and Mimetic Theory<br>
  Publisher: Michigan State University Press<br>
  Author(s): Reineke Martha J.<br>
  Abstract: For René Girard, human life revolves around mimetic desire, which regularly manifests itself in acquisitive rivalry when we find ourselves wanting an object because another wants it also. Noting that mimetic desire is driven by our sense of inadequacy or insufficiency, Girard arrives at a profound insight: our desire is not fundamentally directed toward the other's object but toward the other's being. We perceive the other to possess a fullness of being we lack. Mimetic desire devolves into violence when our quest after the being of the other remains unfulfilled. So pervasive is mimetic desire that Girard describes it as an ontological illness. In
      Intimate Domain,Reineke argues that it is necessary to augment Girard's mimetic theory if we are to give a full account of the sickness he describes. Attending to familial dynamics Girard has overlooked and reclaiming aspects of his early theorizing on sensory experience, Reineke utilizes psychoanalytic theory to place Girard's mimetic theory on firmer ground. Drawing on three exemplary narratives-Proust'sIn Search of Lost Time,Sophocles'sAntigone,and Julia Kristeva'sThe Old Man and the Wolves-the author explores familial relationships. Together, these narratives demonstrate that a corporeal hermeneutics founded in psychoanalytic theory can usefully augment Girard's insights, thereby ensuring that mimetic theory remains a definitive resource for all who seek to understand humanity's ontological illness and identify a potential cure.<br>

  Author(s) Hariman Robert<br>
  Abstract: From the perspective of realism, writing policy is the least of the tasks of statecraft. Action, not words, is the credo, and written statements are incidental accoutrements/or means of deception/or the hallmark of institutions that lack the force to back up their pronouncements. Once again, however, the realist is caught unaware. As the essays in this section demonstrate, foreign policy is a mixture of manifold practices of composition. Whether dependent on unacknowledged texts, or extending cultural practices of racial labeling into state action, or rein scribing the general text of modernity on indigenous peoples, or constructing a common narrative through<br>

  Abstract: Hispano life in prison is poorly documented. This is due in part to lack of access and in part to the fact that men in prison as brothers, husbands, or sweethearts are often forgotten by society. The work reported in this chapter is partly drawn from a study conducted many years ago in a southwestern state. Other material was collected at a correctional facility in another state. I refer to these institutions as CF I and CF II. For purposes of continued confidentiality I do not identify the facilities further and I have given the men fictitious names in this<br>

  Abstract: Analytic statements about music inevitably have a hermetic quality. Even the simplest descriptions, say the labeling of an interval or a chord, call on an assumed body of technical knowledge that, at least initially, does not seem to point beyond itself. Those who love music but lack the technical knowledge tend to find analytic descriptions alienating, irrelevant, or intimidating. Those who have the knowledge do not always feel compelled to use it, or to use all of it. Music in the world survives handily without any help from analysis. Yet no one who wants to understand music deeply can avoid<br>

  Abstract: This chapter does not pretend to offer an anthropological theory of remorse, a field that does not exist and that I have no intention of inventing here.¹ Anthropologists′ lack of attention to remorse either suggests an appalling oversight or alerts us to the Western and modernist nature of concepts. Although anthropological references to vengeance, blood feuds, countersorcery, and witch hunts are many, ethnographic descriptions of individual or collective rituals of remorse and reparation are few indeed.<br>

  Abstract: Scholars of Hindutva have argued that in the context of communal violence in India a heightened sense of vulnerability among members of the Hindu middle and lower middle class is integral to the legitimization of violence, where a “majority” feels threatened by a “minority” (Jaffrelot 1996; Hansen 1999; Nussbaum 2007). In the state of Gujarat, this process includes the projection of a lack of vulnerability onto Muslims, expressed and rationalized by reference to diet, worship, and sexuality.<br>

  Abstract: This chapter addresses the intersection of colonialism, nationalism, and language, in particular, it analyzes how the construction of communities in a colonial context was mediated by ideas about language. I show how debates surrounding the establishment of an educational system and educational language policy in colonial Mauritius became a privileged site for contesting hegemonic claims in the form of negotiating the relationships of different groups in a colonial plantation setting. Conflicting approaches to language in education also informed debates about the role and significance of Indo-Mauritians in ascribing an identity to Mauritius with its lack of a precolonial population.At the<br>

  Abstract: Part of the perennial appeal of Aristotle’s conception of place as something confining and confined is doubtless the philosophical support it offers to human beings’ longing for cozy quarters—not merely for adequate shelter but for boundaries that embrace, whether these boundaries belong to decorated rooms in the home or to indecorous glades in the forest primeval. But human beings (and doubtless other animals) also long for wide open spaces and thus for lack of containment, perhaps even for limitlessness. The cozy can be

  Abstract: No other discipline within the humanities has had to struggle with its own interdisciplinary character as much as theater research in Europe. The fathers of the new-born scholarship
                     Theaterwissenschaftwere mainly concerned with distinguishing theater from other forms of art and with asserting its right as an independent field of enquiry. The need to define a specific methodological approach, however, was not taken into account. This initial lack in the creation of the scientific discipline has influenced the controversial development of theater studies and has caused frequent identity crises.<br>

For us, these words suggest not only age but also antiquation. They signal both the distance of time and that of obsolescence: while something “antique” might be valuable or quaint or interesting, it is not essentially practical or even very useful. This sense of antiquation, which registers a lack of functional relevance, is not unknown to the late sixteenth century or to Spenser, but it is novel and rare rather than usual and standard. It<br>

In today’s world, the older, modern terms of “North and South,” “West and East,” “First World and Third World,” “developed and underdeveloped,” seem intrinsically obsolete. The current context of increasing differentiation between countries encapsulated under these terms, the virtual disappearance of the so-called Second World, and problematic modernist connotations of such terms make their use questionable. The limitations notwithstanding, I will use them interchangeably throughout this chapter for lack of better terms.

  Abstract: The parables of Jesus are puzzling. A lack of comprehension is nothing unusual when one encounters these “short stories.” Even the earliest Christian texts share this assessment as one finds Gospel accounts relating that those listening to Jesus’ teaching did not understand the parables (Mark 4:10.13; John 10:6). The disciples themselves had to ask of Jesus, “Explain to us the parable…!” (Matt. 13:36, cf. Mark 4:10), which is to say that even they did not understand the parables, or at least not immediately. Parable speech is incomprehensible and mysterious. This is also expressed by the term παραβολή (

  Author(s) Altmann Walter<br>
  Abstract: Luther’s first treatise on educational issues, written in 1524, is mainly what will be considered here, being a more programmatic writing.² The second,
                     A Sermon on Keeping Children in School,³ from 1530, contains essentially the same ideas but is a more casual and pastoral piece. After six years, some cities had created schools, following Luther’s proposals. The problem was then parents’ resistance in sending their children to school, as they would lack their labor as workhands. The 1530 treatise is, then, an exhortation to parents to send their children to school.<br>

  Author(s) Garsten Christina<br>
  Abstract: In a study of the Basseri pastoralists of southern Iran, Barth (1961) expresses some surprise regarding their lack of religious interest (they describe themselves as ‘slack Muslims’). His surprise is caused by the fact that religion seems to loom large in the lives of most of the peoples described in classic anthropological studies. This may be a major reason why religion has always been a central field of inquiry in anthropology, even if, as Evans-Pritchard (1962) once pointed out, social scientists have themselves often been indifferent or even hostile to religion.<br>

  Book Title: French Intellectuals Against the Left-The Antitotalitarian Moment of the 1970s<br>
  Publisher: Berghahn Books<br>
  Author(s): Christofferson Michael Scott<br>
  Abstract: In the latter half of the 1970s, the French intellectual Left denounced communism, Marxism, and revolutionary politics through a critique of left-wing totalitarianism that paved the way for today's postmodern, liberal, and moderate republican political options. Contrary to the dominant understanding of the critique of totalitarianism as an abrupt rupture induced by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's
      The Gulag Archipelago, Christofferson argues that French anti-totalitarianism was the culmination of direct-democratic critiques of communism and revisions of the revolutionary project after 1956. The author's focus on the direct-democratic politics of French intellectuals offers an important alternative to recent histories that seek to explain the course of French intellectual politics by France's apparent lack of a liberal tradition.<br>

First, whites of widely varying socio-economic status employ white supremacy as a catalyst to negotiate policy differences, often through compromises that sacrifice the rights of blacks.

In other words, if Jericho was not utterly destroyed as described in Joshua 6, then does the story lack truth and theological value?<br>

Generally, in working with translations among European languages, the translator struggles with word choices when one language contains a particular word that denotes or connotes an idea that the other language does not. Then the translator seeks synonyms, or may resort to a phrase that more completely captures the sense intended.

Kawakami shows how by parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, Modiano's narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This welcome update on the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists will be essential reading for scholars working on contemporary French writing.<br>

  Book Title: In/visible War-The Culture of War in Twenty-first-Century America<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LUCAITES JOHN LOUIS<br>
  Abstract: In/Visible Waraddresses a paradox of twenty-first century American warfare. The contemporary visual American experience of war is ubiquitous, and yet war is simultaneously invisible or absent; we lack a lived sense that "America" is at war. This paradox of in/visibility concerns the gap between the experiences of war zones and the visual, mediated experience of war in public, popular culture, which absents and renders invisible the former. Large portions of the domestic public experience war only at a distance. For these citizens, war seems abstract, or may even seem to have disappeared altogether due to a relative absence of visual images of casualties. Perhaps even more significantly, wars can be fought without sacrifice by the vast majority of Americans.Yet, the normalization of twenty-first century war also renders it highly visible. War is made visible through popular, commercial, mediated culture. The spectacle of war occupies the contemporary public sphere in the forms of celebrations at athletic events and in films, video games, and other media, coming together as MIME, the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network.<br>

  Book Title: Textual Silence-Unreadability and the Holocaust<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): LANG JESSICA<br>
  Abstract: There are thousands of books that represent the Holocaust, but can, and should, the act of reading these works convey the events of genocide to those who did not experience it? In
      Textual Silence, literary scholar Jessica Lang asserts that language itself is a barrier between the author and the reader in Holocaust texts-and that this barrier is not a lack of substance, but a defining characteristic of the genre.Holocaust texts, which encompass works as diverse as memoirs, novels, poems, and diaries, are traditionally characterized by silences the authors place throughout the text, both deliberately and unconsciously. While a reader may have the desire and will to comprehend the Holocaust, the presence of "textual silence" is a force that removes the experience of genocide from the reader's analysis and imaginative recourse. Lang defines silences as omissions that take many forms, including the use of italics and quotation marks, ellipses and blank pages in poetry, and the presence of unreliable narrators in fiction. While this limits the reader's ability to read in any conventional sense, these silences are not flaws. They are instead a critical presence that forces readers to acknowledge how words and meaning can diverge in the face of events as unimaginable as those of the Holocaust.<br>

  Abstract: Debates over health care have focused for so long on economics that the proper goals for medicine seem to be taken for granted; yet problems in health care stem as much from a lack of agreement about the goals and priorities of medicine as from the way systems function. This book asks basic questions about the purposes and ends of medicine and shows that the answers have practical implications for future health care delivery, medical research, and the education of medical students.<br>

In “The Invisibility of Motherhood in Toronto Theatre: The Triple Threat,” I looked at the employment experiences of seven “mother-actors” in the Greater Toronto Area and identified their uniquely inherent challenges in maintaining acting careers within the patriarchal institutions of motherhood (Rich 13), theatre, film, and television (Hawkes 247-269).

  Abstract: I premised at the outset that the idea of community is often romantic and utopian, idealising and evoking a bygone age. Often considered to have been ‘lost’ through modernity, community has also been hailed as the solution to social ‘problems’ by successive governments in the UK. From the New Right to the present Conservative-led coalition government, community has become synonymous with a relinquishment of responsibility by the state (Hoggett et al, 1997). When the women made their move to Spain, community in policy circles was presented by the then government, as a panacea to the lack of social cohesion among<br>

  Abstract: The complex and diffuse identity of the Hui as outlined in the preceding chapter challenges traditional approaches to ethnicity theory. Anthropology in the past was ill-equipped to address this kind of expansive ethnic identity. Given their widespread distribution and lack of cohesion, one may very rightly question the validity of Hui ethnic identity. The Hui regard themselves as an ethnic group, however, and the Chinese state registers them as an official nationality. The Hui are also beginning to play an increasingly important role in the Chinese state’s domestic affairs and in international ethnopolitics. The Hui thus pose an interesting problem<br>

  Author(s) Puyol Angel<br>
  Abstract: The French Revolution proclaimed an ethical and political ideal with its three principles that have not been improved on since: liberty, equality and fraternity. Since then, western political philosophy has put its greatest efforts into analysing the former two (liberty and equality), but has ignored, and even disdained, the third part of the revolutionary triad: fraternity. In my opinion, forgetting or underestimating fraternity as a political category is unjustifiable, given that so many injustices in our world are not only related to a lack of liberty and equality, but also to the scarcity, and sometimes inexistence, of fraternity.<br>

  Abstract: While Siamese/Thai culture, both historically and today, is widely recognized, at times even eulogized, for its pervasive syncretism, theories of cultural hybridity have rarely been used to analyse the patterns of cultural borrowing and fusion in the country. This is largely because accounts of cultural hybridity have emerged from and remain closely identified with postcolonial studies. As Marwan Kraidy notes, “Standing on the shoulders of the disciplines that debated syncretism, 
                  mestizaje, and creolization, postcolonial theory repopularized the term ‘hybridity’ to explicate cultural fusion” (Kraidy 2005, 57). As I noted in my earlier chapter, Siam/Thailand’s lack of a colonial history means<br>

  On Forms of Telerational World-Making from: 
  <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhcqm">Philosophy of Communication</a><br>
  Author(s) Sloterdijk Peter<br>
  Abstract: Lévi-Strauss has indicated a paradox in the form of an antinomy, which is similar to Lacan’s paradox: two series being given, one signifying and the other signified, the first presents an excess and the latter a lack. By means of this excess and this lack, the series refer to each other in eternal disequilibrium and in perpetual displacement. As the hero of
                  Cosmossays, there are always too many signifying signs. The primordial signifier is of the order of language. In whatever manner language is acquired, the elements of language must have been given all together, all at once, since<br>

  Book Title: Translating Childhoods-Immigrant Youth, Language, and Culture<br>
  Publisher: Rutgers University Press<br>
  Author(s): ORELLANA MARJORIE FAULSTICH<br>
  Abstract: Skilled in two vernaculars, children shoulder basic and more complicated verbal exchanges for non-English speaking adults. Readers hear, through children's own words, what it means be "in the middle" or the "keys to communication" that adults otherwise would lack. Drawing from ethnographic data and research in three immigrant communities, Marjorie Faulstich Orellana's study expands the definition of child labor by assessing children's roles as translators as part of a cost equation in an era of global restructuring and considers how sociocultural learning and development is shaped as a result of children's contributions as translators.<br>

  Author(s) Burke David G.<br>
  Abstract: The ink was barely dry on the first copies of the KJV when one of the translation committee’s fiercest critics issued a pamphlet decrying its translation choices and recommending ten specific changes, enumerating ten examples of errors and urging that his corrections be sent to all churches that have bought Bibles. That critic was Hugh Broughton, generally considered to be one of the best Hebrew scholars of the day but also known to lack the temperament to be a part of a committee translation. His treatise,

  Book Title: A Self-Conscious Art-Patrick Modiano’s Postmodern Fictions<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): KAWAKAMI AKANE<br>
  Abstract: A Self-Conscious Art is the first full-length study in English to attempt to deal with the formal complexities of Modiano’s work, by reading ‘against the grain’ of his self-professed ingenuousness. A detailed examination of his narratives shows the deeply postmodern nature of his writing. Parodying precursors such as Proust or the nouveau romanciers, his narratives are built around a profound lack of faith in the ability of writing to retrieve the past through memory, and this failure is acknowledged in the discreet playfulness that characterises his novels. This book is a timely introduction to the work of one of the most successful modern French novelists.<br>

  Abstract: The Bicentenary of the French Revolution in 1989 heralded the series of commemorations by which late twentieth-century France now appears to have been increasingly characterized. In the 1990s, literature, cinema and intellectual debate all began to reflect an increasing focus on memory, a tendency also apparent in popular culture and public life. The historian Pierre Nora, inaugurating in 1984
                  Les Lieux de mémoire, a monumental collection of essays on key ‘sites’ of the French historical experience understood as having had an impact on national self-identity, presented the lack of shared post-war national memory as a rationale for alternative manifestations of<br>

  Abstract: During the 1990s the clumsy term Linguistically Innovative Poetry began to be used of much of the alternative British work of the era. It encompasses a poetic of increased indeterminacy and discontinuity, the use of techniques of disruption and of creative linkage, though its differences with the
                  creativework of the British Poetry Revival do not constitute an absolute break. However, the increased willingness of emerging poets to operate theoretically, in terms of post-structuralist and other theory, to even expound poetics more coherently, was in marked contrast to an earlier lack of such discourse. Ultimately, the definition of ‘linguistically innovative’<br>

  Book Title: Spanish Spaces-Landscape, Space and Place in Contemporary Spanish Culture<br>
  Publisher: Liverpool University Press<br>
  Author(s): DAVIES ANN<br>
  Abstract: Spanish Spaces is a pioneering study that marries contemporary cultural geography with contemporary Spanish culture. The field of cultural geography has grown both extensively and rapidly, as has the field of cultural analysis and debate on Spanish cultural texts; yet despite a convergence in study between cultural geography (and cultural studies more widely) and cultural texts themselves, this has made little impact to date within the area of contemporary Spanish cultural studies. Yet Spain’s varied terrain, with complex negotiations between rural, urban and coastal (negotiations that have on occasion spilled over into political and violent conflict), and perhaps its very lack of a contemporary landscape tradition familiar to British and German cultural studies, offer the opportunity for fresh insights into questions of landscape, space and place. Drawing on case studies from contemporary Spanish film and literature, Davies explores the themes of memory and forgetting, nationalism and terrorism, crime and detection, gender, tourism and immigration, investigating what it means to think of space and places in specifically Spanish terms.<br>

                  thcentury, including the writings of the Kyoto School, founded around Kitaro Nishida.¹ This modern Japanese philosophy originated in the discovery by the Japanese of the Western philosophical tradition during the closing decades of the 19thcentury. There had been until then no knowledge of the latter and no recognizably independent Japanese tradition of philosophy. However, from the time of Kukai, Shinran and Dogen, there had been no lack of religious discourse<br>

  Abstract: The fictional characters’ lack of subjective powers I have discussed so far unquestionably contradicts the humanist model of individual worth, rationality, and self-autonomy. But this should not lead to a simplistic denial of the recovery of the writers’ own creative agency. As Lacan would tell us, the attempt to represent absence is the first step toward replacing the void, opening up possibilities for signification. The breadth and depth of the postrevolutionary inquiry into the Chinese soul in literature attest to the autonomy the writers have reclaimed from Mao’s dictatorial cultural policy.

  Abstract: In writings by the French post-structuralists, rhetorical tropes such as speechlessness, fragmentation, and deflection testify to the writer's difficulty in broaching the subject of love. Similarly, Cook shows that love poetry proceeds out of a profound failure of language resulting from the opacity of discourse, its lack of neutrality, or the fugitive transparency of reference. Writing Lovers also explores race, ethnicity, age, and sexual identity within the context of the passionate excesses of amatory discourse.<br>

French members were referred to as uncle, aunt, and brother. This unusually intimate French-Native intercommunal interdependence owed its urgency to extremely sparse French immigration.

  Book Title: The World in the Trinity-Open-Ended Systems in Science and Religion<br>
  Publisher: Augsburg Fortress Publishers<br>
  Author(s): Bracken Joseph A.<br>
  Abstract: Joseph A. Bracken argues that the failure of theology and science to generate cohesion is the lack of an integrated system of interpretation of the Christian faith that consciously accords with the insights and discoveries of contemporary science. In The World in the Trinity, Bracken utilizes the language and conceptual structures of systems theory as a philosophical and scientific grammar to show traditional Christian beliefs in a new light that is accessible and rationally plausible to a contemporary, scientifically influenced society. This account opens new possibilities for rethinking the God-world relationship, the Trinity, incarnation, creation, and eschatology within the context of a broader ecological and cosmological system. In re-describing these articles constitutive of Christian belief, the author is conscious of the vital importance of retaining the inherent power and meaning of these concepts. This volume freshly retrieves pivotal themes and concepts constitutive of the Christian tradition in a conscious rapprochement with current scientific understandings of nature.<br>

In general, space has been dismissed as a preexisting natural category within which societies are distributed and humans are politically, economically and socially organized: in other words, an infinite three-dimensional emptiness containing bounded places. Euclidean notions of space as homogenous and extensible have permitted passive contemplation of a distanced ‘there’, safely separated and reified as a static entity rather than a changing and socially contingent phenomenon.

  Book Title: America's Education Deficit and the War on Youth-Reform Beyond Electoral Politics<br>
  Publisher: Monthly Review Press<br>
  Author(s): GIROUX HENRY A.<br>
  Abstract: America's latest war, according to renowned social critic Henry Giroux, is a war on youth. While this may seem counterintuitive in our youth-obsessed culture, Giroux lays bare the grim reality of how our educational, social, and economic institutions continually fail young people. Their systemic failure is the result of what Giroux identifies as four fundamentalisms: market deregulation, patriotic and religious fervor, the instrumentalization of education, and the militarization of society. We see the consequences most plainly in the decaying education system: schools are increasingly designed to churn out drone-like future employees, imbued with authoritarian values, inured to violence, and destined to serve the market. And those are the lucky ones. Young people who don't conform to cultural and economic discipline are left to navigate the neoliberal landscape on their own; if they are black or brown, they are likely to become ensnared by a harsh penal system.Giroux sets his sights on the war on youth and takes it apart, examining how a lack of access to quality education, unemployment, the repression of dissent, a culture of violence, and the discipline of the market work together to shape the dismal experiences of so many young people. He urges critical educators to unite with students and workers in rebellion to form a new pedagogy, and to build a new, democratic society from the ground up. Here is a book you won't soon forget, and a call that grows more urgent by the day.<br>

  Abstract: ‘Let’s Make Things Better.’ So announced Philips, the transnational electronics giant, in a new global ad campaign launched in September 1995. The company explained how the theme and slogan were a far better representation of its purposes than the more obvious brag, ‘We make better things.’¹ In fact, the statement was pathetic: bland, vague, and hackneyed. No wonder it fostered an initial flurry of boring ads which featured a smiling employee saying trite things to magazine readers. More interesting than Philips’s lack of inspiration was its commitment of time and funds to this kind of image campaign. Here it followed<br>

  Abstract: The reasons not to write about war are myriad and compelling. They fall into two overlapping categories: war cannot be written about and war should not be written about. For a start, war cannot be written about because the logistical difficulties of doing so are insuperable (the sheer scale of armed conflict is prohibitive). This makes a synoptic view practically and politically problematic to obtain. Then there is a premium on first-hand experience (or ʹcombat gnosticismʹ)¹ that undermines the validity of non-combatant representations. Combatant representations are themselves suspect as they may lack the necessary distance and detachment; censorship and self-censorship<br>

  Abstract: The study of civility is the study not only of the social history of a culture but of the human need for satisfactory social bonds and the problems that emerge when these bonds become too loose or too tight. When they are too tight, we are left with a collectivism that engulfs the individual, drowning out personal needs and aspirations. When they are too loose, the individual is deprived of the safety of communal norms and abandoned to a wasteland of freedom in which interactions between self and others lack meaning and depth.

The fold, in turn, allows us to overcome some of the more ambiguous elements in Sartre’s thought, particularly insofar as his retention of a dualistic vernacular evokes a problematic image of transcendence and therefore remains trapped in this crisis. The remaining issue with Merleau-Ponty concerns his lack of a worked-out conception of force, particularly within a<br>

This theory runs through a vast panorama of universal history, which is painted in the book’s central chapter in a quaintly archaic style that could make the anthropological reader wince.

This practical presupposition is seldom defended explicitly; rather, it is taken to be self-evident—simply what one does when one does political philosophy.

He was undisputedly Christian, but his primary object of veneration was less the martyr’s passion than the interconnectedness of man and nature. He was dissatisfied with the contemporary arts — which, in his view, demurred from presenting the unfolding of the natural world — and considered Weimar Classicism a flight into the past. He saw classicism’s failure primarily in its lack of attention to color. Using Jacob Böhme’s theology of light and dark as a basis, Runge developed his own approach to religious painting.

  Abstract: As a genre, musical autobiographies fit comfortably in neither musicological nor literary studies. The vagaries of personal recollection make autobiographical writing problematic as a source of historical information, while the failure of many musical writers to realize that the genre is inherently subjective and highly artificial leads to the condemnation of many musical autobiographies for a lack of literary merit. To play on Goethe, whose own autobiography from 1823 served as a spiritual example for many later artists to follow: musical autobiographies reflect little

This essay will follow Steiner’s insight and ask why the tragic was not, circa 1772, fully embraced.

  Abstract: The English-Canadian short story got off to a hesitant start in the twentieth century. To a considerable extent this was due to the lack of appreciation that Canadian literature had to face in its own country at the time and the limited publication facilities in Canada that resulted. Early short-story writers such as Knister, Grove, and Callaghan were thus forced to find their way into print mainly outside the country. The collected stories of all the major modernist writers, except for Callaghan and Garner, appeared decades after their conception, that is, in the 1960s, the period known as the Elizabethan<br>

  Abstract: Scholars maintain that a major source of work-family conflict is the lack of sufficient time in the day to meet work and family obligations (see, for example, Hochschild 1997; Parcel 1999). This time crunch is exacerbated by the increase in work hours over the past thirty years, especially for professional and managerial workers and for women (Jacobs and Gerson 2004). Work-family researchers generally see long work hours as negative consequences of employer demands or increased competition wrought by globalization and industry consolidation (Schor 1992; Hochschild 1997; Jacobs and Gerson 2004; Blair-Loy and Jacobs 2003; Fraser 2001).

Abstract: The staminal hypothesis was extremely successful and inspired curious elaborations. In 1719 a collection appeared of
            Essays on Providence and on the Physical Possibility of the Resurrection. Published in French, its claim to have been “translated from the English of Dr. B.” for a while turned Boyle into the presumed author. The book has been attributed to Jean‐François Bion, a French priest who converted to Protestantism after being chaplain to Huguenotgalériens.98Bion’s purpose was to elucidate Providence and resurrection physiologically. The will, he explained, has no influence on bodily processes such as the circulation of the blood but can control others (for example, breathing) that are just as essential to life and as much governed by general and immutable laws. The reason why some functions can be voluntarily directed is that they depend on an excess of fluids, with which we are free to do what we want. It is the same, Bion claimed, with Providence. God originally put in nature fluids that lack a determinate function, and these he uses occasionally to alter the course of nature without suspending its laws (see
                  , p. 18). Thus could He stop the movement of the sun and the moon so that Joshua could defeat his enemies (see Josh. 10:12–13) or (a physico‐theological favorite) make the iron axe float on the waters of the river Jordan.E<br>

Abstract: The analysis presented here would go further, asking how this union member

Does the working‐class news watcher present his interpretation proudly and defiantly, demonstrating a sense ofcomradely bondingwith other workers who he expects should agree? Or does he say it hopelessly and cynically, as many politically disconnected Americans do when discussing the mass media? Resistance can mean different things in different settings; when there is no sense of shared goals, and very loose bonds, as with the Buffaloes, resistance may simply reproduce and reinforce the lack of mutual obligation.<br>

Abstract: 1. Is paradigm the right choice, and have I used it correctly?There is always a risk in adopting a concept that comes from a different tradition. It is even riskier when we fiddle with it and stretch it to fit a set of data for which it was not designed as I have done. But I believe that the risk is warranted for two reasons. The first is that there is considerable confusion within and outside of anthropology regarding the nature of the anthropological study of language. The oscillation mentioned in the article among a number of labels, including linguistic anthropology, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and ethnolinguistics, is only the most superficial and yet telling example of the widespread lack of clarity as to what constitutes linguistic research from an anthropological perspective. Further evidence of confusion can be inferred from the typically partial and often clumsy attempts to represent the linguistic subfield (or the study of language) in sociocultural anthropology textbooks. I felt that it was time to come to terms with the fact that perhaps those of us inside the subfield had not been communicating to those outside as effectively as we thought we were. I then realized that to address this issue I needed a notion that by its very nature would force us to think in terms of broad trends rather than particular notions or hypotheses. The popular notions of paradigm and paradigm shift seemed to me the perfect candidates; they could force us to think in terms of the major features of our research projects. CookGumperz and Gumperz are right when they write that Kuhns approach gives a sense of structural containment to the flow of ideas that to those living with them appear much more fluid and overlapping. (Their proposal to adopt Holtons themata is a bit cryptic given that his model is not considered an improvement on Kuhns by most historians of science.)

Abstract: The genre of the memo has attracted little attention as an object of study because it would seem to lack the features of what in literary theory we like to call a text. Individual memos are less representative of the genre in the very proportion that they are more interesting as texts. But the ubiquity of the memo belies its triviality and raises questions about writing in modernity that cannot be answered by asking these questions only of figures such as Joyce, Freud, Darwin, or Heisenberg. We can begin to enrich the interpretive context of the memo by referring it to the theme of
         bureaucracy,a subject of long‐standing sociological interest. Unsurprisingly, Weber observes in his great workEconomy and Societythat “the management of the modern office is based upon written documents (‘the files’)” and that this form of writing is necessarily connected to the very idea of the office or “bureau” as the spatial means of organizing scribal labor.15The generic features of these written documents also express the impersonality Weber saw in bureaucratic authority because the author‐function is attenuated in this form. Yet Weber evinced little further interest in the particularity of bureaucratic writing. Its study has been parceled out to several other fields: the practical discipline of business writing (later a subfield of composition), the emergent field of communication studies, and the field of business history.<br>

Abstract: Unfortunately, Gadamer’s case against the Enlightenment “prejudice against prejudice,” while representing an important first step in the direction of a viable cross‐cultural hermeneutical theory, still does not address the very real problem of distortion in cross‐cultural study. For the one feature of historical understanding that ensures the hermeneutical productivity of “prejudice” in Gadamer’s theory is largely absent in cross‐cultural understanding. What distinguishes those prejudices that are productive of understanding from those that lead to misunderstanding is the derivation of the former from the tradition of which the text to be interpreted is a part.
         22This derivation guarantees a level of continuity between the questions the interpreter brings to the traditionary text and those for which the text was originally the answer.23In other words, the text itself has played a role in constituting the tradition that has influenced the interpreter’s questioning. This continuity establishes a topic of common concern that is the precondition for an authentic conversation between text and interpreter. In contrast to those prejudices that constitute one’s belongingness to tradition, invalid prejudices fail to transcend the subjectivity of the interpreter and are therefore discontinuous with any legitimate meaning offered by the traditionary text. Such idiosyncratic prejudices will therefore distort one’s interpretation.24Now it is precisely the feature of these subjective prejudices that renders them unfit for intracultural understanding, namely, their lack of a connection with the tradition of which the text is a part, that characterizes all prejudices, traditionary and idiosyncratic alike, when it comes to the interpretation of a culturally foreign text. The vast body of Christian apologetic literature, both past and present, testifies to this tendency of cultural prejudice to distort the meaning of culturally foreign religious facts.<br>

Abstract: Meyers is not so naive as to hold that careful screening and imaginative trope play will automatically yield a liberatory model of individual agency. She insists that the self‐figurations that “survive this vetting must become embedded in the cognitive, emotional, and corporeal structures that shape agency and that function as criteria of self‐appraisal. To agentically integrate dissident self‐figurations, women must command skills that enable them to invest emotionally in these tropes and to reconfigure their embodied values as well as their patterns of thought and volition in accordance with them” (55). How? Partly through changes in child‐rearing practices and the social order more generally, but Meyers’s view presumes that the skills for emotional investment and revision of values and volition are already available to most women. However, it can be argued that many women lack these skills and find it arduous to embed new figurations in their cognitive, emotional, and corporeal selves. It is hard to see how any amount of screening and play will take us from image to agency. A more productive approach would be to focus on developing those skills (including through changes in the social order), but that option is constrained in part by the predominance of the very imagery of which Meyers is critical. She uses commanding language in her argument for experimentation with new subjectivities—women
      mustscreen,mustviscerally imagine,mustembed new self‐images,mustcommand skills. This makes it easy to miss her recognition of the insufficiency of such measures, as does the relative lack of detailed proposals for restructuring the social order. Yet one cannot simply flout the power of cultural images in women’s lives. By exposing the feedback loop between self‐image and agentic skills in a patriarchal order, Meyers establishes that image and agency are not two distinct paths. Her emphasis may be on imagery, but it is clear that image and large‐scale political change mu~<br>

Abstract: The more polemical, the more passionate the essay, the more likely it will generate critical responses and rejoinders—a trademark feature of the journal—accompanied by footnotes. And, so, when Richard Stern published his private dialogue with himself about the physical appearance of certain writers at the 1986 International PEN conference, Joyce Carol Oates insisted on not only an angry rebuttal—punctuated by constant page referencing to Stern’s “pig‐souled sexism”—but photographic evidence—a kind of footnote in itself—dismissing his physical characterization of her.
      4When Susan Gubar published “What Ails Feminist Criticism?” her essay provoked an immediate, critical, and heavily documented response from Robyn Weigman, several letters to the editor, and Gubar’s own footnoted rejoinder. Jane Gallop’s defense of a sexual act she engaged in with one of her students and Paul de Man’s controversial writings in a Belgian newspaper in the thirties (which, incidentally, resulted in a marked decline in the number of times he was cited in our pages) generated similar feelings of anger, disgust, and betrayal, all accompanied by footnotes.5This journal, in fact, argues that passion is not diminished when it is superscripted. It is a further mark of its complex nature that although submissions have been rejected for not being passionate enough, and they have been rejected because of a lack of necessary citation and documentation, not one essay in our memories has ever been rejected because it did contain footnotes.<br>

Abstract: According to James Lowenthal, “sacralizing some chosen time in the past … impedes historical understanding” (2000, 67) because the sacred defies explanation. For religious fundamentalists, all time—past, present, and future—is sacralized, as God’s plan constitutes the meta‐narrative of all history. Thus, history becomes imbued with inevitability, the richness of historical dilemmas is flattened out, the potential appreciation for multiple causalities is quashed, and all of history leads to a renewed avowal of faith or the condemnation for lack thereof. Moreover, the tantalizing sense of strangeness that all deep historical inquiry ought to engender (Wineburg
         2001) becomes an impossibility, for in a world where all events are simultaneously foretold and foretelling, “astonishment” as a “delight of learning history” (Lowenthal2000) is unlikely at best. Astonishment, after all, remains the domain of unbelievers.<br>

Abstract: Information exchange.—The first condition cannot easily be overestimated, since many prejudices result from a lack of information. These prejudices have three aspects that impede dialogue: stereotypes used (unknowingly) when viewing the other party, ethnocentrism that depicts the other party as an outsider and thus as inferior, and finally more or less subtle forms of discrimination that humiliate the other party. Merely supplying written information is not sufficient to neutralize lack of information; research has shown that the best method is contact with the other party with a view to “live information exchange.”42It seems that ecclesiastical documents satisfy this condition, as they do not advocate mutual exposition (from an observer perspective) but mutual witnessing (from a mutual participant perspective), like the Vatican declaration “Dialogue and Proclamation” from 1991 (nos. 40 and 55). The problem with these documents is that interreligious dialogue mostly stops short at witnessing. Hence the interreligious dialogue is restricted to mutual witnessing and does not lead on to the two other conditions I mention, perspective exchange and perspective coordination. As a result the dialogue is truncated, deficient. Can this mean anything else than the traditional view of mission in which dialogue, despite claims to the contrary, is subordinated to the growth of the church?<br>

         101She had no strong feelings about it and was musing over the reasons for its demolition: maybe lack of public funding for renovation, maybe other urban plans, most likely a political gesture. She described herself as anti‐Communist, but she thought that there should be reconciliation between the past and the future and that there was no need for drastic exorcisms. Commenting on the demolition of monuments as well as on the renaming of cities and streets, Julia said she liked New York, where she and her boyfriend wanted to emigrate, “because all the streets are straight and there are only numbers and letters to remember.”102History becomes unbearable occasionally.<br>

Abstract: Empirical studies of these multiple conditions do in fact suggest ways in which children exercise social agency, such as through resilience to poverty’s effects, awareness of family situation, support of parental employment, self‐limitation of wants, and capabilities to adapt and grow even under the severest conditions. However, they also reveal a massive failure of American society to respond to the needs of its most vulnerable members, and indeed to respond to human vulnerability as such. The problem faced in children’s poverty is not just children’s lack of social participation. The problem, more fundamentally, is that “social participation” in the United States today is defined in a primarily adult, individualistic, market competitive, and utilitarian way, so that children are bound to lose out. Barbara Bennett Woodhouse has argued that American “rights” language tends to emphasize this kind of state‐free autonomy over state support for needs and dignity.
         47Or, as Jürgen Habermas would put it, the lifeworld of children (both within and outside families) has been thoroughly “colonized” by the values of the marketplace, values that happen to be chiefly agential and adult.48<br>

Abstract: There is a good body of work in recent French philosophy on the issue of recognition. Emmanuel Renault, Christian Lazerri, and the antiutilitarian MAUSS (Mouvement anti‐utilitariste en sciences sociales) come readily to mind. Axel Honneth and Charles Taylor are influential, but so, too, are Bourdieu and other French sociologists. In spite of the original contributions of these French authors, none of their work has been made available to English readers to date. A first step toward filling this lack has been made with this translation of the final opus of the recently deceased Paul Ricoeur on the theme of recognition.<br>

Abstract: To anticipate a criticism of the use of Habermas’s discourse ethics, there should be acknowledgment of Bent Flyvbjerg’s opinion, which is shared by a number of people: “The basic weakness of Habermas’s project is its lack of agreement between ideal and reality, between intentions and their implementation” [
      36, p. 215]. In directly countering Habermas’s discourse ethics, Foucault says, “The problem, then, is not to try to dissolve [power relations] in the utopia of completely transparent communication but to acquire the rules of law, the management techniques, and also the morality, the ethos, the practice of the self, that will allow us to play these games of power with as little domination as possible” [37, p. 298]. However, Habermas does admit, “Bargaining processes are tailored for situations in which social power relations cannot be neutralized in the way rational discourses presuppose” [38, p. 166]. Their positions are not so far apart, and the common ground is the ethics of the discursive practice. Furthermore, Habermas and Foucault share some phenomenological justification for their positions. Communication may not be transparent, as the Habermasian ideal would prefer, but neither is power a totally corrupting force. There are times when the discourse in librarianship will be agonistic (competitive and possibly strained); an agreed‐upon set of rules for ethical communication is still the most effective antidote to disruption and authoritarianism and assurance of rights being recognized.<br>

Author(s): Popkin Jeremy D. <br>
Abstract: Omissions are plentiful in these accounts: the selection of a field, the routines of teaching, squabbles with colleagues, rivalries, ambition and desire for recognition. Exceptions surface here too—women who discuss gender bias in their profession, authors from the working class who struggle to adapt to the academic world—but most authors keep mute on the same questions. Popkin offers several explanations for these silences, ranging from shame to fear of colleagues’ reactions to narrative concerns (tedium, lack of drama). The most significant and fascinating factor, however, is that these authors write autobiographies as, first and foremost, members of a profession. They free themselves, it is true, from this profession’s norm of self‐effacement by expressing their individuality and discussing private matters. But they do not shed their disciplinary identity in the process. On the contrary, their autobiographies sustain the profession’s norms and values. They minimize conflicts, belittle individual achievements (in the classroom, for instance), and omit mention of aspirations that question the ideal of fraternal, disinterested scholars who live a pure life of the mind. This is true of other disciplines as well, but history, reliant as it is on cumulative, collective scholarship, finds it especially difficult to celebrate individual achievement. Autobiography, this most personal of genres, hence services collective authority, professional community, and an ostensible containment of the self.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: ci.2007.33.issue-2<br>
Date: 01 2007<br>
Author(s): Gasché Rodolphe<br>
Abstract: What, then, for Derrida, is European responsibility or responsibility as something specifically European? The conflicting exigencies formulated in the foregoing discussion of the concept of responsibility require the invention of a new way in which to renew, revive, or replay the figure, concept, or idea of Europe. European responsibility is, first of all, this openness to
      bothtraditions of responsibility, namely, Platonism and Christianity. It consists in exposure to the radically conflicting demands that these two traditions make upon their heirs as responsible selves. European responsibility is above all the uncompromising willingness to assume the challenge posed by the aporetic nature of inheritance itself—that is, by the constitutive lack of handed‐down rules or norms to negotiate contradiction. Consequently, Europe is the name for a responsibility that also goes hand in hand with the necessity of having to invent, each time anew, new ways of meeting mutually exclusive demands. As a simultaneous responsibility to, at first, two opposite traditions, European responsibility consists in not letting one of the traditions overturn, outplay, or outdo the other. By doing justice to its double heritage, and not shunning the necessity of negotiating conflicting demands in the absence of pregiven norms or rules, such responsibility not only entails a radical refusal of traditionalism, for structural reasons, but also is distinguished by openness to other traditions and demands. Indeed, from the moment that Europe is understood as a responsibility to more than one tradition or set of injunctions, its responsiveness and responsibility extend to all other traditions. Apart from being hospitable to other historically and culturally decisive intra‐European differences (such as Judaism and Islam—not in the abstract, however, but with all their shades and forms), as well as to the many minor, or marginal, differences within Europe, this principal openness that the name E~<br>

Author(s): Wall,  John<br>
Abstract: Wall claims that “moral life is inherently creative” and that this fact “demands a fundamental rethinking of the nature and meaning of moral life itself” (vii). For Wall, creativity is a possibility that is primordial to human being, ultimately expressing humans’ imitation of the creative power of God. The importance of creativity has been covered over by a tendency in the West to separate poetics from ethics. Wall aims to remedy this lack by explicating moral creativity as the capacity to invent an ever more inclusive vision of life. This moral creativity is developed in stages, from the being of the moral self as a creative tension of freedom and finitude (chap. 1), to the capacity of humans to bring narrative unity to their moral lives (chap. 2), through the poetic response demanded by otherness (chap. 3), to the creation of ideologies and utopias in social life (chap. 4). As an original contribution to moral reflection, this book has much to recommend it. While it is certainly not unusual today to see a call for ethics to become poetic, in postmodernism this usually means abandoning ethical reflection in favor of poetic invention of self or community. Wall manages instead to link poetic creativity to philosophical reflection, making creativity the symbolic ground of discourses of philosophical anthropology, teleological and deontological ethics, and social critical/liberationist thought. Wall’s use of specific narratives is likewise fruitful: tragedy is used for reflection on the status of moral evil and limitation, while the biblical creation story is interpreted to symbolize the potentialities of creativity. In sum, the book delivers on its promise to heal the divide between poetics and ethics, rather than simply replacing ethics with poetics.<br>

Author(s): Harootunian Harry<br>
Abstract: It is important to recognize that the historical present as a global unity already marks the coevality and immanence of the noncontemporaneous contemporary moment. A historical present filled with mixed temporalities has always been a condition of capitalist modernization, even as its copresent uncanniness was suppressed by both the authority of the future perfect and the expectations of progress that vowed to raise all societies to the same level. The effect was to displace the uncanny temporal figure to the world outside of Euro‐America and put its societies under the sign of underdevelopment, which announced comparative lack. The force of the collective singular lay in singularizing all plural histories capital encountered along its way and in assimilating them to its exemplar. This return to a perspective of the historical present might allow us to rewind the narrative of acculturation that has reinforced the externality of clock and calendar time to disclose the texture of the uncanniness of mixed temporalities it had smoothed out and straightened.
         21What seems promising about the opening supplied by the present is the specularity of unevenness, which both constitutes its sign and defines its relationship to the industrial societies of Euro‐America, and its capacity to now become the mirror of our own nature. Specifically, this experience among so‐called late developers actually made available to the “enfeebled center” of Euro‐America both the recognition of the temporal immanence of the marginally uneven and the spectacle of its existence in our own backyard.22<br>

Author(s): Scimeca Ross<br>
Abstract: The authors develop a framework for addressing the question of truth in librarianship and in doing so attempt to move considerations of truth closer to the core of philosophical debates within the profession. After establishing ways in which philosophy contributes to social scientific inquiry in library science, the authors examine concepts of truth currently found in the literature. Analysis reveals that only scattered attention has been given to this issue. As a result, there is a lack of clarity about the relationship between theories of truth and the practice of librarianship. The authors review the three prevailing theories of truth in philosophy and then introduce a new construct of truth rooted in an early version of historicism. The authors conclude that this theoretical framework offers a new method for understanding how the objective practices of librarianship only can be adequately explained by considering their place within a contextualized process of historical development.<br>

Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 589491<br>
2008<br>
Author(s): Stewart Garrett<br>
Abstract: For the protagonist to become his own lack, of course, is only a felt castration if he feels he has something to lose. And, thanks to Amy, Arthur doesn't realize that anything has been lost, that there has been any story to compare with hers, any love like it, or even one as strong in another and more fundamental way. Yes, in giving up the name Dorrit just before the close of her namesake novel, Amy has become her own antithesis in Mrs. Clennam, agent in turn of the same suppression, with the result that the most insidious role reversal yet, the real identity transfer, is that of Arthur for his own silenced maternal origin. Unprocessed mourning cannibalizes the other whose absence it cannot accept, whose very recognition the narrative has blocked in order to transmute it. As narratography (rather than narratology) is scaled to register along the lexical, syntactic, and figurative terrain of fictional prose itself, the arc of Dickensian plotting cannot afford in full view to lament its founding victim, nor let its hero elegize her, nor let the heroine acknowledge her let alone (and because of) the place she holds in her stead. And not being able to love the mother, or mourn her,
         the son has become her.Here lies the keenest if quietest violence of the novel: the double silencing of male as well as female energy even in their most defining of adult relations and the foisting of all connubial desire onto a life of communal duty instead.<br>

Author(s): Balsamo Gian<br>
Abstract: Schopenhauer’s rejection of individual will’s self‐serving egoism bespeaks a greater concordance than he is willing to acknowledge between his views and Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of
         voluntas. As discussed, to Augustine the harder one’s individual intention strives to coincide with love, the better one gets to know oneself; and the better one gets to know oneself, the more diaphanous becomes the diaphragm separating one’s real self from its ideal reflection in the mirror of introspection. Self‐knowledge is self‐making in Augustine, and this self‐making consists of the transformative self‐denial whereby one purposefully modifies one’s own will until a coincidence is reached between desire and love. Schopenhauer accuses Augustine of “expressing in a naïve way” the role played by will in one’s self‐determination. According to Schopenhauer, when Augustine draws an analogy inDe civitate Deibetween “gravity [as] the motion of the body” and “love [as] the motion of the soul,” he is confusing the “real necessity” bestowed on both motions by the same cause, that is, by the self‐deployment of will in time and space, with the soul’sliberum arbitrium indifferentiae, that is, the undifferentiated free will whereby the soul, contrary to the body’s deterministic fate, chooses its own destiny.56There is no “undifferentiated free will,” hence no perfectible self in Schopenhauer; one either succumbs to the necessity of will’s self‐deployment or affirms one’s freedom by obstructing it, by boycotting it. Schopenhauer is an Augustinian reductionistmalgré soi—a revisionist of Augustine’s avocation of the perfectibility of the self. Schopenhauer’s reductionism is reflected in the lack of direction intrinsic to his project of self‐emancipation from the dominion of will. In Augustine the obstruction of the instinctive drive of self‐interest is a figuratively upward movement (momentum), deriving its direction from the self‐abnegation, the weightlessness of love;57in~<br>

Author(s): Miller Richard B.<br>
Abstract: Wars that do pass muster on just‐war terms have both moral and political benefits. Put more abstractly, when just‐war morality is expanded to connect with the habits of social criticism, it can contribute to the twin needs of legitimation and justification in democratic contexts. Obviously these points take us beyond Augustine and his vision of a just war. As a product of the premodern era, just‐war doctrine is typically viewed as enabling us to address a war’s moral justification (or lack thereof). But legitimation is different. In modern, democratic settings legitimation turns on the presence of consent (tacit or explicit) to acts authorized by public officials. Its value lies in the democratic commitment to hold authorities accountable to citizens and to provide a firm basis for political representation.
         73Concerns about legitimation are part of a broader theory of justified political coercion: reasons should be provided to persons whose liberties are restricted by a policy. Otherwise such restrictions are tyrannical, imposed heteronomously. Thompson and Gutmann remind us that legitimation is premised on the idea that “the moral authority of collective judgments about policy depends in part on the moral quality of the process by which citizens collectively reach those judgments.”74Drawing on the habits of self‐restraint, critical self‐analysis, and willingness to deliberate publicly, the ethics of war can seek the best of both worlds. Just‐war morality can provide moral resources for ensuring that we enter a war that reflects the popular will, one that does not seek to impose its will unjustly on that of others.<br>

Author(s): Eades Caroline<br>
Abstract: These methodological oversights are surprising since Eades is clearly familiar with research exploring the links between history, memory, and collective representations. She cites Jacques Le Goff, Marc Ferro, Pierre Nora, Michel de Certeau, Paul Ricoeur, and Henry Rousso alongside a wide range of colonial/postcolonial historians and theorists, including Robert Stam, Benjamin Stora, Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, and Dominick LaCapra. In the end, theory and formal analysis drown out contextual issues of production, distribution, and reception. Three of the book's four chapters deal primarily with theme and form; only the first examines historiographic issues in their own right. This imbalance is not necessarily a flaw, but it does illustrate the challenges of interdisciplinary research and writing. Many film scholars will welcome the author's extraordinarily detailed inventory of the strategies used in postcolonial cinema to critique imperialism, particularly the creative subversion (and to a lesser extent, perpetuation) of representational conventions inherited from colonial‐era painting, literature, and movies. On the other hand, cultural historians will likely be disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the life of these films in society, the multiple meanings attached to them by viewers, and their relation to competing discourses of the same era.<br>

Abstract: But how shall all these shards of information be catalogued, organized, and merged into a larger enterprise? How shall information become knowledge and inquiry be disciplined? If the internet decenters research, the university remains staunchly hierarchical, committed at some level to selection, procedure, and evaluation. After all, its academic programs are built on what we call the course that from some motivated beginning promises to reach a plateau of understanding ten or fifteen weeks later. Student plans of study put courses in relation to one another, and we call the sum of courses, including their progression and interrelation, a curriculum. Of all American film scholars, Bordwell has been most dedicated to the film curriculum. His textbooks establish the bedrock information, concepts, and skills that enable more sophisticated inquiry into what he calls the historical poetics of the medium. He argues for and from first principles and believes students should progress to higher‐level courses (and presumably can succeed in them) only after having mastered foundational material (a modicum of film history) and skills (close analysis, archive research, and so on). But rare is the department in the U.S. that has implemented such a program, at least at the undergraduate level. Few film professors would refuse—for lack of prerequisites—smart, eager neophytes (English majors, say) who ask to join a senior seminar in feminist film theory or in the globalization of film distribution. Except in its production track, film studies does not take itself to be analogous to chemistry or economics in this regard. Still, at the minimum film studies programs should arrange things so that students can grow term by term in the depth, breadth, and subtlety of their film analyses and historical inquiries.<br>

Issue: 603531<br>

Author(s): Stokes Christopher<br>
Abstract: I would like to conclude by noting that, of course, Coleridge’s poetry offers a particularly concrete representation of the struggles—linguistic, volitional, and existential—that surround the experience of prayer.
         70The verbal paralysis that seizes the Ancient Mariner would be the most obvious and illustrious example:
               While the Mariner does, of course, pass beyond this crisis of language, one must note that release occurs only after he is able to render a strange wordless and volitionless blessing, a kind of secret arche‐prayer that allows further ones to be made: “I blessed them unaware” (line 285). While I would hesitate to map the theory of later decades onto much earlier poems, this is nonetheless a fine representation of Coleridge’s enduring faith that even where “no tongue … may declare” (lines 282–83), something may also be happening, perhaps working wordlessly against language, to bring about being‐for‐God. Moreover, the same juxtaposition of a struggle to enunciate prayer with a corresponding imaginative turn to the wordless also features in many of Coleridge’s private lyrics. For instance, the sonnet “When they did greet me Father” expresses an inability to pray predicated on a lack of receptivity and response to the divine, evoking speech that cannot become speech and words that will not come: “Th’ unquiet silence of confused thought” (line 7). It is signifiers that mark the limits of language—tears and groans—that stand in for what cannot be uttered here and that conclude the poem. “The Pains of Sleep” also expresses a preference for wordless prayer—“No wish conceived, no thought exprest” (line 8)—but, in its latter stanzas, depicts a spiritual desolation that demands a more concrete form of utterance and appeal. Yet the speaker’s attempts to pray aloud are marked by “anguish and … agony” (line 14), and the precant’s voice, like his corrupted will, is alienated from itself: “My own loud scream / Had waked me from the fiendish drea~<br>

Author(s): Coleman Charly<br>
Abstract: Whereas Sutcliffe took theoretical cues from Horkheimer and Adorno, Sheehan introduces his study with a quotation from Blumenberg, who, as was previously noted, regarded modernity as an unprecedented response to the problem of divine omnipotence, one that ultimately produced a radical break with theological explanations of the cosmos. Sheehan shares with Blumenberg a lack of interest in models that posit the simple translation of religious categories and institutions into secular ones, but his object of study, the Bible, puts him in a stronger position to examine the fate of religion in the modern world. Thus, he concentrates “less on the disappearance of religion than on its transformation and reconstruction” (Sheehan, xi). His method, moreover, loosely follows Blumenberg's claim in
         The Legitimacy of the Modern Agethat the “identity” between theological and secular categories “is not one of contents but one of functions.”37Sheehan contends that seventeenth- and eighteenth-century efforts to assemble translations of the Bible alongside voluminous commentary represented the “enlightenment” of Scripture through shifts in media more than in message. This approach leads Sheehan to redefine the Enlightenment as the “new constellation of practices and institutions … that the eighteenth century used to access a host of religious, historical, and philosophical questions inherited from the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution” (Sheehan, xi–xii).<br>

Article Title: Critique and Promise in Paul Tillich’s Political Theology: Engaging Giorgio Agamben on Sovereignty and Possibility<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 651999<br>

Abstract: This seemingly reflexive construction of possibility as a gift of itself to itself shows the blind alley facing Agamben and the need to undo this knot or to find ways of engaging it. One of the particular difficulties the problem of sovereignty engenders is that since sovereign power always retains possibility to itself, it evacuates the air of possibility from all corners of space. Lacking any of the resources of the possible, critics cannot propose alternatives to the sovereign. For instance, the idea of natural right and its inalienable character itself can buckle under the state of the exception. Right, which would seem indelible, is an actuality that grounds the political and could never be evacuated. But for Schmitt and Agamben, sovereignty can swipe to one side right with its ability to engage the possible beyond every actuality. Immanent criticism depends upon the discovery of possibility, and when critics lack this ability to think otherwise than the actual, to imagine an alternative to what is, their powers wither. Restoring the critical and the political requires a reconsideration of possibility, sovereignty, and the relationship of critique to gift. To that end we now turn at last to Tillich’s work.<br>

Article Title: Literary Unrest: Blanchot, Lévinas, and the Proximity of Judaism<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 655202<br>
Date: 8 2010<br>
Author(s): Hammerschlag Sarah<br>
Abstract: In this sense both Judaism and communism constitute messianic forms of community, communities that can only articulate themselves in the acknowledgement that their time is indeed
         not now. The source for Blanchot's identification of Judaism with this structure of deracination and disappropriation is clearly Lévinas's own essays on Judaism. Lévinas's own conception of Jewish universalism would also seem to imply the lack of self-coincidence that Blanchot emphasized. For if it is indeed the case that to apply the termIsraelethnically involves forgetting “that Israel means a people . . . which has reached the fullness of its responsibility and self-consciousness,” then it would seem that Israel represents an ideal and not a reality, a goal and not a fact. Yet the question remains as to the relation between this ideal and the Jewish people. Insofar as Lévinas does not in his political writings cultivate the element of disappropriation that is so crucial to Blanchot, his political writings run the risk of indulging the impulse toward exemplarity or self-affirmation of which Blanchot is so wary.<br>

Article Title: Animals, Poetry, Philosophy, and Dante's<br>
Publisher: The University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 653501<br>
Date: 08 2010<br>
Author(s): Schildgen Brenda Deen<br>
Abstract: But the animals that actually appear in Dante's poem function as a type of allegorical equation rather than as analogy. For example, the eagle as poetic image does not reveal anything new or surprising about eagles, or, indeed, about the justice of God. Nor do the three beasts in
      Inferno1 reveal anything about the behavior of these creatures or about the specific sins they represent. Rather, they enact a pattern of allegory that Erich Auerbach links to the classical past in contrast to what he identifies as Dante's “figural” allegories. For Auerbach, “Virgil,” as an example, is “not an allegory of an attribute, virtue, capacity, power, or historical institution. He is neither reason nor poetry nor the Empire” to which the simplified nineteenth-century notion of allegory had reduced him. Auerbach's understanding of allegory makes Virgil “afiguraof the fulfilled truth that the poem reveals, and this fulfillment is more real, more significant than thefigura.”33In the static-type allegory of the three beasts ofInferno1 or the eagle ofParadiso, real creatures have become personifications. This pattern resembles what Fredric Jameson has defined as allegory in his discussion of a Balzac novel (La cousine Bette) where “realistic characters” little by little become possessed and devolve into personifications. In Dante, these animal beings are already personifications in the same way that his bi- natured creatures that lord over various sections of hell (Minos, Geryon, centaurs) are personifications. Jameson argues that characters that turn into personifications lack individual existence or personality as they become equated with some notion of the universal—in other words, they become abstractions.34Similarly, the animals that Dante turns into personifications lack particular features other than their stereotyped traits, and thus they lose their species individuality to their abstract or universal symbolic meaning. In Auerbach's understanding of Dante's system of alleg~<br>

Abstract: It is a truism to state that there are as many Augustines as there are interpreters or, in any case, schools of interpretation.
      
            His work could be called an1
         opera aperta, albeit in quite a different sense from the way this expression was meant by its inventor, Umberto Eco.
            Eco's use of this phrase mainly concerned modernist works, such as Joyce's2
         Ulysses, whose very structure allows the reader to find his way in the labyrinth of the artwork without ever arriving at—or, for that matter, departing from—one single, fixed level of meaning. The metaphor of theopera apertaopened up a peculiar combination of structure and randomness, the latter made even more mysterious by modernism's emphasis on austerity of form. While it cannot be denied that for Joyce the fact that every line and every word were meticulously planned and put in their proper place was the precondition for the emergence of riddles and clues, thus widening up the scope of language and meaning, for Augustine things seem to be quite different inasmuch as the flow and width of his discourse is in place right from the beginning. In his case, randomness seems to be part of the structure of the discourse itself, to the extent of beguiling Henri-Irénée Marrou—still the most prominent historian of Augustinian rhetoric—into accusing Augustine of a lack of rhetorical skills: “Saint Augustin compose mal.”
            Fortunately, Marrou retracted this accusation in a later edition of his book:3
         
            One wonders whether this new appreciation of Augustine's style, being part of aI took for incapacity or indifference what was in fact conscious discretion, calculated flexibility, expressive deformation, brought about by adroit maneuvering. I took for barbarism or decadence what was in fact the supreme sophistication of an art that was completely in control of its own techniques and in search of subtle effects. To blame the rhetorician Augustine for “not k~<br>

Abstract: This situation reflects the field as a whole. Descriptivists tend to take up theory later in their careers, after they have done their solid research. This means that theory is often done by nonspecialists. Consequently, because they lack expertise in theory itself they are usually unable to work abstractly enough at the macrolevel of theory formation. It says a great deal about what we think of theory as an intellectual and scholarly enterprise when we tolerate an arrangement in this area that would be unthinkable in any other area of scholarly expertise. Theory proper cannot be understood as a set of tools or as something exterior to research, but rather as that which forms the thinking which underlies research itself.<br>

Abstract: An alternative approach has been to explain the impure discharges as a result of their uncontrollable nature. For example, to explain the biblical distinction between the minor impurity of semen from other genital discharges, H. Eilberg-Schwartz argues: “Since semen is ejaculated from the body through orgasm, its loss is symbolically associated with direct action and conscious thought. Nonseminal discharge and menstrual blood, on the other hand, are passively released from the body.”
         
                  But this theory is hard-pressed to explain why the impurity of a deliberate sexual act is the same as that of an accidental seminal emission (Leviticus 15:16).20
               
                  Upon reading these attempts, one is struck by the intense efforts expended to derive the concrete rules pertaining to bodily conditions from abstract categories. When the originally-proposed dichotomies (life/death, control/lack of control) fail to fit the data, further distinctions are added—male versus female, upper versus lower orifices, etc.—with the aim of preserving the abstract category distinctions.21
               
                  If adding more detailed parameters based in embodied experience contributes to a better understanding of the data, perhaps we should consider the possibility that the logic is embodied through and through and unrelated to abstract schemes. Or perhaps this can be formulated as a question: should a correct interpretation be based on an abstract explanation which sees beyond the textual details which focus on bodily experience, or should the explanation emerge from an engagement with the “grisly details” of bodily experience?22<br>

Abstract: Amélie Rorty, the one philosopher among the commentators, engages with the systematic elements of my argument: the problems of considering morality as a cultural system and of whether a systematic understanding of evil as a category is possible. She agrees that morality is not properly a system but a “polymorphous pluralism” in practice and observes that the multiple concerns of Anglo-American moral theory exhibit distinctive and even incommensurable logics and rationales. Rorty, like Parkin, accepts that attention to the dark side can illuminate what is at stake in morality but is surprised at my focus on evil as the “primary default contrast.” As with Crapanzano’s reading of my argument as dualist, I must rejoin that I take evil to be not so much a default contrast as an existential possibility that subtends morality and makes it necessary. However, the core of Rorty’s commentary makes it clear that the category of evil exhibits multiple concerns that are just as incommensurable and unsystematic as those of morality in general. In a tour de force paragraph that is both analytic and historical, she parses 11 components of evil broadly conceived (I only wonder if there are others, including violence and wickedness) and weaves them into a coherent narrative of incommensurability (I only wonder if this is lack of a system or complexity of a system). This is particularly valuable because it makes me realize the extent to which my argument is inflected toward one of those components, namely, malevolence. Finally, I reiterate that philosophers have not been as reticent as anthropologists to engage evil (see my footnote listing several recent philosophical works on the topic, not least among which is a book by Rorty herself). I resist attributing this to philosophers’ ethnocentrism. As Rorty observes (and Crapanzano as well), it has something to do with the morality of anthropology as a social practice.<br>

Abstract: Between these two camps there are what we might call the “compatibilists”—critics who recognize both Satan and Eve as sources for the dream and do not feel compelled to frame the discussion in terms of an either/or. Northrop Frye saw the dream both as satanically influenced and as a kind of “wish-fulfillment” on the part of Eve—an argument echoed by Patrides: “The dream, though instigated by Satan, is yet a projection of her innermost desires and aspirations.”
         
               More recently, N. K. Sugimura has taken up the question, and while she begins by claiming that “Satan, not Eve herself, gives rise to the distempering; spirits enter from the outside,” she quickly adds that on another reading the dream “gestures at a notion of defilement occurring less from an agent entering in from the outside than from a process of actualizing, or realizing, what is already present on the inside.”17
            
               Like the internalists these critics point to something already inside Eve that facilitates the seduction, but they generally do not see this as evidence that Eve was fallen before she fell. Compatibilists are simply more comfortable with the dream’s lack of a single point of origin and the subtle dialectic it involves. As Irene Samuel puts it, “however much [the dream] was18
            induced by Satan, it wasproduced by Eve’s own mind.”

Article Title: From Religionless Christianity to Immanent Grace: Bonhoeffer’s Legacy in Badiou<br>
Publisher: University of Chicago Press<br>
Issue: 677726<br>

Abstract: According to Badiou, the event is logical rather than phenomenological, which is to say, it draws from presentation itself. Thus the initial intervention is purely “of the order of declaration.”
            
                  It does not declare the meaning of an event, but it simply and emphatically declares the fact of its having happened: “there is an event, it has consequences, and these consequences need to be faithfully elaborated in relation to the status quo that has been interrupted.”107
               
                  From the conditions of his own “conversion” Paul draws the consequence that one can only begin from the declaration of the resurrection being the “real of faith,” a declaration that is in essence subjective, for no preconstituted subset can support it.108
               
                  The apostle must be accountable only for what others see and hear, that is, for his or her declaration.109
               
                  It is the essence of faith to publicly declare itself; even though private conviction is required, only the public confession of faith installs the subject in the perspective of salvation.110
               
                  The truth of a declaration, being without proof or visibility, emerges at that point where knowledge, be it empirical or conceptual, breaks down. Hence Paul’s “antiphilosophy”: apostolic declaration stems from and gives expression to a pure fidelity toward the possibility opened by the event.111
               
                  If truths lack objective strength, then their substance must be provided by the subjective persistence of fidelity that supplies the truth procedure with consistency.112
               
                  The substance of truth is faith. Fidelity is to be seen not as “a capacity, a subjective quantity, or a virtue” but as “a functional relation to an event.”113
               
                  Miller rightly points out that “whether finitude or infinity prevails depends o~<br>

Abstract: In the spectacular moments of pain so often associated with early modern tragedy, the character’s suffering can be conveyed visually; language reinforces and interprets what has already been communicated. In Philip Massinger’s
      The Roman Actor, two characters, Junius Rusticus and Palphurius Sura, are tortured on stage. These men do not describe their pain; they merely smile through their torture and attribute their fortitude to Stoic philosophy (3.2.97–99).
            The lack of language does not impede the communication of pain. Those watching the torture react bodily to the scene before them, and one witness, Parthenius, states, “my sinews shrink, / The spectacle is so horrid” (3.2.82–83). As an onstage witness, Parthenius provides, on the one hand, a model for responding to this sight and, on the other, a clear indication that such a model is unnecessary. Any witness, or audience member, would be subject to the bodily reaction he experiences.26<br>

Date: 03 2011<br>
Author(s): Ortenberg Alexander<br>
Abstract: A large number of professionals and critics were scandalized, indeed, when they learned that due to the immense popularity of the palace, there were plans to conserve it after the exposition's close.
         
               The San Francisco chapter of the AIA and a number of prominent architects advised against such plans; in fact, if any "plot" against Maybeck's palace existed, his contemporaries in the professional community were the conspirators.22
            
               However, due to Polk's ardent support, the structure was spared from the demolition that was the fate of the rest of the fair. Even though the city of San Francisco was never able to find an appropriate use it, it also survived several plans to clear the land. However, due to the lack of maintenance, by the 1950s the palace was in such a state of disrepair that it began to raise concerns for public safety, and it was declared unsafe for use.23
            
               When the attempts of city officials to secure state and federal funds for the building's restoration failed, the battle for its preservation seemed to be over. Then in 1958, a two-million-dollar donation came from a wealthy San Francisco businessman, Walter S. Johnson.24
            
               Combined with other funds collected for the palace's restoration, Johnson's donation made such a project feasible, and, after deliberation, the decision was made to replace the aging structure with a replica. In 1968 the Palace of Fine Arts was rebuilt with permanent materials.25<br>

Abstract: Stanton Marlan, “Hesitation and Slowness: Gateway to Psyche's Depth,” San Francisco Jung Institute Library Journal, 2005, 24:1, 17-27. This paper focuses on hesitation and slowness in the work of Jungian analysis. It emphasizes the importance of patience as a way of achieving depth and of avoiding facile and abstract formulations that lack respect for the true otherness of the analysand and for the fundamental enigmas of analytic work. Alongside the techniques of Freud and Jung, and drawing on Alchemy and on Renaissance and Eastern wisdom traditions, the author articulates a complex notion of hesitation. The paper deconstructs simple binary pairings of fast and slow and suggests an attitude of purposeless wandering as an important compensation to the overly technologically-oriented attitudes and fast-paced culture that have invaded our therapeutic sensibilities and consulting rooms.<br>

Author(s): GUNNELL JOHN G.<br>
Abstract: The turn to the philosophy of scientific realism as a meta-theory for the study of International Relations manifests a reluctance to confront the basic problem of the relationship between philosophy and social scientific inquiry. Despite the realists' rejection of traditional empiricism, and particularly the instrumentalist account of scientific theory, the enthusiasm for realism neglects many of the same problems that, more than a generation earlier, were involved in the social scientific embrace of positivism. One of these problems was a lack of understanding regarding the character and history of the philosophy of natural science and its relationship and applicability to the study of social phenomena. Proponents of realism have also neither adequately articulated and defended realism as a philosophical position, and distinguished it from other perspectives, nor confronted the fundamental challenge to realism and other foundationalist philosophies which has been mounted by the contemporary critique of traditional representational philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Alvin Gouldner's life and work is considered within the framework of his own attempt to fashion a reflexive sociology during the second half of his career. In the first half, Gouldner was a functionalist and dutifully contributed insights and theoretical innovations to the paradigm, even while remaining critical of Talcott Parsons' own version of structural-functionalism. Later, by 1962, Gouldner broke from the dominant tradition to become an outspoken critique of establishment sociology, in the process becoming more sympathetic to competing theories, especially Marxism. Eventually, Marxism, too, was found to be inadequate because of its lack of reflexivity, and Gouldner became further alienated from both traditions of sociology. Concomitantly, Gouldner was battling on personal and professional fronts in his role of social critic. He became increasingly hostile toward others for their willing compliance with prevailing cultural prescriptions, which he believed were robbing human beings of their agency, vitality, and will to power. Lacking authentic knowledge of oneself, one could not hope to create social theories which benefited society and contributed to the liberation of the human spirit. Gouldner was a tragic hero, for although he came to an understanding of the limitations of human strivings in creating socially beneficial social theory, and fought valiantly to establish a program to fill this lacuna, he ultimately failed to deliver upon the promise of these insights because of his own hubris (on the personal front) and the internal paradoxes of reflexive sociology (on the professional front).<br>

Abstract: Notwithstanding the growing use of interpretive analysis in public administration and policy research, its fullest potential for evaluating intractable public conflict has yet to be tapped. We develop a mode of narrative analysis, partly based upon Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutics, that shows promise for analyzing public disputes. We illustrate this with a case study in Los Angeles involving a contentious proposal to inject recycled wastewater into the city's water supply. The analysis reveals that, by representing opposing interests with a simplistic narrative, the water industry's response has been superfluous. The latter assumes that impasse simply results from the public's lack of information, the logical response being an information dissemination campaign. We employ a hermeneutic approach to reveal a set of persistent issues that project proponents have hitherto failed to address. By respecting the inherent plurivocity and intertextuality of narrative, hermeneutics provides new inroads into controversial public issues. We close the discussion with implications for practice.<br>

Abstract: There is no more salient figure in early Chinese literature than Kongzi and yet he remains a figure about whose beginnings we know very little. The present essay explores this paradox of bibliographic salience and biographic silence through an in-depth examination of the principal narratives of the Kongzi legend from the Shiji and the Kongzi jiayu, paying particular attention to the language of their respective accounts of the birth of the sage. Finding a distinct lack of fit between the form and content of these these stories, I propose a narrative alternative drawn from the early Han weishu accounts of Kongzi's beginnings. Finding in this alternative a more coherent fit between language and narrative structure as well as recurrent themes such as divine visitation, infertility, jiaomei sacrifice, and cranial disfigurement, vestiges of which are also found in the accounts of Wang Su and Sima Qian, the essay suggests that the weishu texts preserve a fuller popular legend of fertility sacrifice by the childless coordinated with the winter solstice also present in the very name Kongzi and resonating with the charter myth of the Zhou, "Sheng min." The evident implication of this finding is that the historicity of Kongzi is arguable. The name is more like a mythic literary fiction and probably began, as did that of Hou Qi, as a symbolic deity that was made historical in one of its many Warring States incarnations, that one transmitted to us exclusively through the normative biographical tradition. ﻿中國文學中最爲著名的人物莫過於孔子。可是關於他的出身家世我們知道得微乎其微。本文詳細考査了《史記》、《孔子家語》以及漢朝緯書中有關孔子出生的故事。筆者認爲漢朝的緯書對“婦人無子而於冬至郊楳”這一通俗傳說保留得最爲完整。故事中不但直接提到孔子的名子，從其事跡亦可以隱約看到《大雅》“生民”神話的遺跡。本文的結論是孔子的歷史眞實性是大可爭議的。這一名子很可能與周的始祖后稷一樣，最先亦是源於神話傳說，到了戰國時期才演化成歷史人物。並如眞實的歷史人物一樣被地寫入了傳記。此後人們所見到的便無不是這一經過歷史化了的孔子了。<br>

Author(s): Guery François<br>
Abstract: La précaution a été critiquée non en elle-même, mais comme « principe », à la fois sur le plan juridique et scientifique. Les formulations du principe prêtaient à confusion, à cause du jargon « scientifique » utilisé (cf. absence de preuves, de « certitudes scientifiques »). Liée à l'urgence, la précaution ressortit à une philosophie de l'agir, qui comporte menace, vulnérabilité, anticipation, appréhension, et c'est de ce côté qu'il faut chercher la logique de la précaution. En premier lieu, une « déduction sémantique a priori » (Derrida) permet de mettre en évidence les caractéristiques de la peur, qui justifie la précaution. En second lieu, un rappel de la tradition philosophique confirme cette déduction, rappel qui va d'Aristote (Rhétorique : ce qu'est la peur et comment on est quand on l'éprouve; Éthique à Nicomaque : le courage, l'intrépidité, la disposition acquise) à Heidegger (Être et Temps : la peur comme disposition insigne, esquisse de l'angoisse, du souci, de la responsabilité, de la résolution), en passant par des étapes essentielles : Augustin (la cura, la curiosité), Kant (derniers écrits), Nietzsche (Seconde Inactuelle). Enfin, et en conclusion, la précaution apparaît non comme une démission de la connaissance, mais comme une incitation à mieux scénariser, à mieux gérer l'avenir, en cultivant une imagination anticipative, complémentaire de l'innovation. If Precaution has been criticized, on both a legal and a scientific level, it is not as an approach in itself but as a Principle. The way the Precautionary Principle has been formulated was confusing, jargonistic : lack of proof, of scientific certainty. Linked as it is to the notion of Emergency, Precaution is part of an Acting Philosophy which includes Threat, Vulnerability, Anticipation and Apprehension; its logic is to be found therein. Firstly, a « semantic deduction a priori » (Derrida) will help to define the characteristics of Fear, which justifies Precaution. Secondly, we shall confirm this d~<br>

Abstract: On the occasion of the recent publication of a complete translation into French of Sein und Zeit, the author of the article means to approach the work with a "prejudice of innocence." Three philosophical questions are first treated. Reflection on time introduces the theological debate. For Heidegger, theology, as metaphysics on which it depends, is marked by "the forgetfulness of being." But does not the lack in him of a stand on moral conscience reveal a weakness of his thought on otherness? As for his theory of "concern", because it does not go back to its hebrew sources it fails to make "creatureliness" thinkable. The debate would deserve to be resumed starting from a philosophical analysis of the anamnesis.<br>

Abstract: Present discourses on technology education are taking a positive and value-neutral approach with utilitarian and vocational overtones. The discourses generally lack discussions of human agency and human responsibility for techno-scientific activities and technological literacy. To support the emergence of a collective civic literacy, we argue in this text that technology education needs to take up critical and value-acknowledging aspects with emphasis on building sustainable relationships among human beings, technology, and lifeworld. To understand the relationship between human agency and modern technology, we examine the nature of technology in the dimensions of technology as causality and technology as a relationship of lifeworld. Discussing Martin Heidegger's perspectives on the causalities of technology, we question how the nature of technology situates human beings in power-related relationships to the world. Understanding technology as process and relationship of lifeworld, the paper extends its discussion of the responsibility of a dialectical human-technology-lifeworld relation based on a socio-technical and ethico-moral framework of technology. By recognizing human responsibility of and for modern technology, we outline a critical and reflective approach to technological literacy. The approach challenges the position of current approaches to technology in the attempt to provide a foundation for a contemporary pedagogy of technological awareness and values. Aujourd'hui, les discours en matière d'enseignement de la technologie sont en train de prendre une orientation positive et dépourvue de jugement de valeur comportant des connotations utilitaristes et professionnelles. En général, les discours n'ouvrent pas assez de discussions sur l'action humaine et la responsabilité humaine dans les activités technico-scientifiques et dans l'alphabétisme technologique. Dans ce papier, afin de renforcer l'éclosion de l'alphabétisme civique collectif, nous ouvrons le déb~<br>

Abstract: Les années 1960 sont à part. Elles représentent pour les uns une rupture, pour les autres un tournant ou une cassure, mais peu importe le mot utilisé: le constat est unanime. Cette décennie marque pourtant une étape passée un peu inaperçue dans l'histoire du protestantisme français faute d'une étude d'ensemble. Ouverture œcuménique, contestations internes, crise des mouvements de jeunesse et crise théologique, mutations des comportements et des mœurs, émergence de nouvelles structures, montée en puissance du protestantisme évangélique... Comment interpréter cette décennie de révolutions pour le protestantisme : enrichissement ou éclatement? The 1960s stand apart. Some see them as a rupture, others as a turning point or a break: whatever the word used, the verdict is unanimous. Yet, for lack of an overall study, this decade is a somewhat neglected stage in the history of French Protestantism. Ecumenical progress, internal conflicts, crises in youth movements, theological crisis, changes in behaviour and conduct, emergent new structures, the rising influence of evangelical Protestantism... How should this decade of revolutions for Protestantism be interpreted: enrichment or fragmentation? Die sechziger Jahre stehen für sich. Die einen deuten sie als Bruch, die anderen als Wende oder Einschnitt, aber es kommt auf das benutzte Wort nicht an: die Feststellung ist einstimmig. Dabei markiert dieses Jahrzehnt ein Stadium in der Geschichte des französischen Protestantismus, das mangels einer Gesamtuntersuchung fast unbemerkt blieb. Ökumenische Öffnung,interne Streitigkeiten, Krise der Bewegungen innerhalb der Jugend und theologische Krise, Veränderungen der Sitten und Verhaltensweisen, Erscheinen neuer Strukturen, starkes Wachstum des Evangelikalismus... Wie ist dieses Jahrzehnt der Umwälzungen und Umbrüche im Protestantismus zu deuten, als Bereicherung oder als Auseinanderbrechen?<br>

Author(s): FREEMAN MICHAEL<br>
Abstract: Genocide is a political catastrophe. Yet it has not received much academic attention. A few social scientists have studied it. Philosophers have largely ignored it. There is a large literature on the Holocaust, but there is little agreement as to how this should be related to other genocides. Some have argued that the Holocaust represented a crisis of Western culture, but that Western culture has not responded adequately for the lack of the appropriate self-understanding. This crisis has been attributed to the predominance of scientistic models of rationality in our culture. Social-scientific approaches to genocide have been criticised because of their commitment to logical empiricism, which is held to be epistemologically and ethically inadequate. Ethical approaches based on liberal humanism have been criticised by post-Nietzschean philosophers for their attachment to allegedly outworn metaphysical assumptions. However, the deconstruction of social science and liberal ethics leads in the direction of relativism and nihilism, which are either useless or dangerous in the face of evils such as genocide. The arguments against conventional social science and ethics are examined, and a counter-critique made of post-modern philosophy in order to clear the ground for constructive thinking about genocide.<br>

Abstract: In a will of 1335, Piero Morosini bequeathed to each of his daughters 1,000 lire ad grossos
(roughly 385 ducats) for her dowry and corredo, 'secundum usum nobilium dominarum de Veneciis'
('as is customary for noble women in Venice'); ASV, Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 1154, Bruto, no.
32. In a civil action of 1382, the Giudici del Procurator ordered that the estate of Federico Corner
should add to his dowry allocation to his daughters 'quid deffecerit congruentie' ('what it lacks to
make it suitable') in order to carry out Federico's testamentary provision that the daughters receive
'quelo che besogna per maridarle' ('what is necessary for their marriages'); ASV, Giudici del Pro-
curator, 'Sentenze a Legge', Reg. 2, fol. 114". In 1385 Nicolô Morosini ordered in his will that if his
descendants should lack the means of providing dowries for their daughters, then his bequest to them
in immovables might be sold to 'maridarle segondo la condicion soa' ('arrange marriages appropriate
to their status'); Notarile, 'Testamenti', Busta 679, Bellancini, prot., fol. 26v. In his will of 1416
Giovanni Morosini instructed his brothers to add enough from his estate to their father's bequest of
1,400 ducats for the marriage of their sister 'ut ipsa cum honore et prout congruit conditionem
domus mee honorificentius maritetur' ('in order that she may marry as honorably as possible and in a
manner befitting the status of my house'); ibid. Busta 1234, Sorio, no. 509.
Fathers also specified that they wanted their daughters to marry noble husbands; Andrea Ari-
mondo in 1427 declared that each of his daughters was to be married 'in uno zentilomo de Veniesia'
('to a Venetian gentleman') (ASV, Cancelleria Inferiore, 'Miscellanea Testamenti', Notai Diversi,
Busta 27, no. 2697); that same year Michele Navagero instructed his executors that his daughter 'se

Abstract: Faire l'histoire des sciences sociales après 1945, dans un contexte de circulation transnationale croissante des savoirs, pousse le chercheur à s'intéresser à la dimension internationale des carrières scientifiques. Dans le cas de Michel Crozier, un des leaders de la sociologie française après 1960, ses relations avec les États-Unis furent capitales pour expliquer la réussite de sa carrière. Ressources scientifiques, appuis académiques, inspiration intellectuelle plus générale, les États-Unis lui furent un remarquable tremplin. Mais, dans cette vie entre deux pays, la pensée de Crozier fut finalement celle de la distance critique, aussi bien vis-à-vis de la France que des États-Unis. Cela explique peut-être, in fine, sa relative perte de notoriété dans ces deux pays. Outlining the history of the social sciences after 1945, in the context of the increasingly transnational circulation of knowledge, obliges us to contemplate the international dimension of scientific careers. For Michel Crozier – one of the leading French social scientists post-1960 – his relation to the United States was crucial for the success of his career. Providing scientific opportunities, academic support and general intellectual inspiration, the United States were to him an amazing springboard. Nevertheless, as a consequence splitting his time between these two countries, Crozier's thought became the expression of critical distance towards both France and the United States. Ultimately, this perhaps explains his relative lack of fame on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

Abstract: By saying this 1 do not imply that the physical vvorld, plants and animais, in the way they
function, lack any normative moment. Nor do I suggest that the ethical dimension is in some
way 'added' to the world by the subject. One of Dooyeweerd's great insights has been that the
non-human world is réceptive to normative qualities of human behaviour. This is expressed by
the concept of object function. Inanimate objects, plants, and animais have an ethical object
function, which means that their physical, biotic, and psychical functioning is receptive to and
can be opened up by appropriate moral functioning of human persons. Knives can be used to
kill and to heal. The knife is not just a knife, a merely physical object; it is in some cases a mur-
der weapon and in other cases a healing instrument. The ethical object function of the knife is
indicated by its mindering and healing qualities — qualities that are not 'added to' the knife,
from without so to say, but functional possibilities of the knife itself.<br>

Abstract: Auch wenn vielerorts von der Vernachlässigung der Kirchengeschichte im Religionsunterricht gesprochen und ein mangelndes Geschichtsbewusstsein beklagt wird, sind Schülerinnen und Schüler durchaus für Geschichte und auch Kirchengeschichte ansprechbar. Die Herausforderung besteht heute jedoch darin, sie dazu zu befähigen, mit dem Wissen über Geschichte umzugehen, ihr Leben mit Geschichte sinnbringend und verantwortungsvoll zu gestalten. Gerade hierfür stellt die jüdisch-christliche Tradition wertvolle Ressourcen bereit. Ausgehend von der jüdisch-christlichen Tradition und im Diskurs mit der Geschichtsphilosophie möchte ich dazu anregen, mit Schülerinnen und Schülern im Religionsunterricht eine Form des Eingedenkens in der Perspektive der Hoffung zu entwickeln. Hierbei wird eine Gedächtnishaltung intendiert, die nicht in der Idee einer reinen Fortschrittsgeschichte aufgeht, sondern zurückblickt, sich den Tiefen und Ambivalenzen vergangenen Leids stellt und die Toten in die Vision einer besseren Gesellschaft einbezieht. Dabei bleibt das Gedächtnis stets dem Leben und der Zukunft zugewandt und gibt ethische Impulse für die Gegenwart. Gerade im Religionsunterricht können Schülerinnen und Schüler befähigt werden, zu „Redenden und Handelnden“ der Geschichte zu werden, auch indem der Frage Raum gegeben wird, woraus Kraft für Erinnerungsarbeit geschöpft werden kann und welche Hoffnungsperspektiven bestehen. Even if neglect of Church History in Religious Education is widely criticised and complaints are heard about a lack of historical consciousness, pupils -female and male – are often found to be quite open to history and church history. The challenge today consists in helping them to deal with their knowledge of history, to create a relationship, or life, with history in a way that makes sense and is actually responsible. For this purpose the Jewish-Christian tradition offers valuable resources. Based on the Jewish-Christian tradition, and in discourse with the philosophy of~<br>

Abstract: The citizenship of the Hermeneutic Philosophy surpasses multicultural proposals. It detects the lack of pre-philosophic solutions: cosmopolitan, republican citizenship, communitarian and liberal. As a consequence, it assumes and fuses equalities and differences in a project. It establishes the merging of four key horizons: the sense of belonging to a community; an agreement in rights and obligations of an identifier project; the right to take part in politics (to be co-legislators), and the validation of a right according to interests. In consequence, it gives the right of opportunity over the right of possession; making the strange our own. This citizenship reaches, by hermeneutic empathy, each one to grant him the subsidiary of a categorical right. It is an invitation to treat others as you would yourself.<br>

Abstract: This article examines how three contemporary French texts explore two distinct but related preoccupations, mourning and photography. Just as Roland Barthes's La Chambre claire provides a space in which the author may think about photography and simultaneously address his difficulty in mourning his late mother, so François Bon's Mécanique can be regarded as a tribute to the author's father, as well as a meta-reflection on photography. In Mummy, mummies Alain Fleischer relates the practice of mummification to photography; the article argues that the insistence on the mummies of Ferentillo throughout the work obliquely refers to the lack of mourning characteristic of the Holocaust.<br>

Author(s): Scheuch Erwin K.<br>
Abstract: First of all an overview is presented of the development in the social sciences that led to postmodernism. The starting point for this is the modernity that was under the influence of Parsons after the second World War. It extended to the Third World mainly in the context of development research. Since the end of the 1970s the contributions of two German scientists, Niklas Luhmann and Jürgen Habermas, have received international recognition. During this time the first critical voices concerning the modernist theories were heard. Among ideas opposing these theories the approaches should be named first, which the author calls "post industrial". To these he counts primarily the analysis of the modern socio-economic system by Daniel Bell and the studies of the "post-material personality" by Ronald Inglehart. Research on the change of values in modern societies should be named in the same context. However, "post-industrial" should not be confused with "post-modern". The origin of the latter term from the "culture scene" is explained. The language of the post-modernists can be viewed as their characteristic, as well as the attempts of deconstruction imprinted by Derrida. Ever since Lyotard the strong bond between the name and the named object within the language has been questioned. Therefore, Jean Baudrillard is correct in noting a loss in the sense of orientation of the modern human being. For example, the works of two post-modernists, Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck, are discussed in detail, after which the author concludes: "That is the most important meaning of postmodernity: as a symbol for the weakened autonomy of the sciences and arts, as a lack for the support of sciences in culture and politics". Nevertheless one can observe a return to rationality in recent years.<br>

Abstract: Freud, 'Civilization and its Discontents', XXI, pp. 115,116. Freud was highly crit-
ical of Woodrow Wilson, whom he considered a naive leader who misread the mutual
hostility inherent in social life. On this point, see Brunner, Freud: The Politics of Psycho-
analysis, ch. 4. It is important to note that when fascism emerged in Europe, Freud's sug-
gestion that the leader is essential to the formation of groups was strongly criticized.
Erich Fromm, for example, saw in his age a disintegration of the super-ego or conscience
(p. 167), and suggested that it is precisely the lack of individuality that springs from this
disintegration that propels men and women to crave an all-powerful leader and external
source of authority (or the anonymous rein of public opinion, the norm and science in
democratic regimes). Fascism, according to this interpretation, springs from the inability
of modern men and women to cope with their freedom and individuality, and with their
corresponding aloneness (or homelessness) in the world. See Erich Fromm, Escape
From Freedom (New York, 1941), especially chs. 5 and 7.<br>

Abstract: Oponiéndose a la perspectiva que reduce toda problemática vinculada a las drogas al orden del exceso y descontrol, este trabajo interroga la articulación entre ciertas consecuencias del capitalismo neoliberal en Argentina y la variación en las prácticas de consumo de drogas en conjuntos sociales vulnerables. Particularmente, examino el vínculo entre el sufrimiento social generado por la violencia cotidiana y el trauma crónico engendrado por la pobreza y la exclusión social y el consumo de cierta sustancia popularmente denominada "pasta". La producción del olvido, la fragmentación de la memoria y la disociación son los estados que los usuarios asocian y/o promueven con el uso de esta sustancia. De este modo, el argumento de este trabajo consiste en que mientras el uso de drogas se convierte en una de las pocas alternativas que los jóvenes disponen para aliviar el sufrimiento social asociado con la destitución social, esta condena al olvido limita el potencial para que los recuerdos y las experiencias se conviertan en materia prima para el trabajo de la memoria, la constitución de una capital emocional compartido e identidades sociales complejas. /// This work, opposing to the perspective that reduces all problems related with drugs to excess and lack of control, deals with the articulation between some consequences of neoliberal capitalism in Argentina and the variation in practices of drug taking in vulnerable social groups. It analizes especially the link between social suffering generated by day-to-day violence, chronical trauma engendered by poverty and social exclusion, and the taking of a substance popularly called "pasta". Production of forgetfulness, fragmentation of memory and dissociation are the conditions associated or promoted by consumers through the use of this substance. The point of this work is that while the use of drugs becomes one of the few alternatives young people have to aliviate social suffering associated with social destituteness, it conde~<br>

Abstract: Régulièrement proclamés partout dans le monde, la liberté d'expression et le pluralisme de la presse sont considérés comme des instruments de mesure démocratique. Seulement en France, où le journaliste porte dans son hérédité la tradition littéraire du débat d'idées, la diversité des opinions tend à se réduire. La déontologie professionnelle est associée à des dispositifs visant à établir l'objectivité – procédés linguistiques, recours systématique à des études sociologiques – dont les effets sont souvent de restreindre le jugement ou du moins de le conformer à des faits « scientifiquement » établis. L'observation, l'intuition, l'enquête sont ainsi supplantées par des protocoles qui agissent comme des écrans dans la démocratie d'opinion. Alors même que l'on continue d'accuser les médias de manipulation, la production endogène d'une pensée commune est une des raisons de sa perte d'influence. Generally claimed around the world, freedom of speech and press pluralism are considered as instruments of democratic measure. However in France where the journalist has in his heredity the literary tradition of ideologic debates, the diversity of opinions is lowering. Professional deontology is linked with rhetoric devices – linguistic process, resort to sociological inquiries – whose effects are often to refrein assesments or to produce them, according to « scientifically » set up items. Investigation, intuition, clearsightedness are overlapped by procedures which appear as screens in relationship to the public opinion. Even if the media are accused of manipulation, the endogeneous production of a commun thought is one of the reasons of their lack of influence.<br>

Article Title: Rereading the Book in Henry James's The Ambassadors<br>
Publisher: University of California Press<br>
Issue: i345794<br>
Date: 12 1, 1909<br>
Author(s): James Kevin<br>
Abstract: This essay argues that in Henry James's The Ambassadors (1903) Mrs. Newsome, who appears to be merely a representative of everything un-Jamesian, particularly a lack of moral and aesthetic imagination, should not be so quickly dismissed. Post-structuralist critics do not hesitate to denounce her. They typically identify Mrs. Newsome's "book" of expectations for Strether, her emissary, and for Chad, her successor, with the closed book of logocentric tyranny; both are said to rely on unambiguous reference and to enforce the cold rationality of linear causation. Derridean readers of The Ambassadors unmistakably prefer Madame de Vionnet's Paris, embodying as it apparently does their own essentially skeptical doctrines about representation. James, however, plays a more subtle game of balance and synthesis, suggesting that while Newsome's book is firm against new impressions, expecting experience to submit utterly to preconceived plans and moralistic evaluations, it also successfully asserts against Parisian representational openness and mystery the viability of reasonable explanation. Her book is vindicated insofar as it stands for the persistent relevance of linear causality and for the nonabsolute grounding of speculation in the concrete world of events and consequences. Newsome's extreme rationalism is in fact denied full authority early in the novel, whose true subject is located when extreme skepticism seems to dominate and explanation seems irrelevant. During the course of the story, time's subtle order slowly reemerges, and James the realist steps forward from behind the post-structuralist veil.<br>

Abstract: Although the I960 student sit-ins were not nearly as uncoordinated as contemporaneous and subsequent accounts suggested, their repeated characterization in participants' accounts as "spontaneous" merits explanation. Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. Narratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of representations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the more general importance of narrative-as distinct from collective action "frames"-in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolidation of movement organizations.<br>

Issue: i276939<br>
Date: 7 1, 1989<br>
Author(s): Donald Edward L.<br>
Abstract: In this issue, the California Law Review presents an exchange of views on the problem of evaluation and legal thought. Professor Rubin's Article opens the discussion by suggesting that the absence of an evaluative theory has had unfortunate consequences for the development of legal scholarship. Professor Rubin contends the lack of agreed-upon criteria for considering scholarship has stunted debate over substantive issues and encouraged the use of unexamined intuition as a basis for judgment. In formulating an evaluative theory to resolve this deficiency, Professor Rubin applies the epistemological approach of several modern continental philosophers-Habermas, Gadamer, Heidegger, and Husserl. The Article recommends that scholarship be judged using the criteria of clarity, persuasiveness, significance, and applicability. Professor Rubin also suggests that evaluators consider the doubt and anxiety they feel when confronting a work from a subdiscipline that is different from their own. The Article is followed by Professor Schlag's response.<br>

Article Title: The Ideal Explanatory Text in History: A Plea for Ecumenism<br>
Publisher: Blackwell Publishers<br>
Issue: i369549<br>
Date: 10 1, 1980<br>
Author(s): Davidson Tor Egil<br>
Abstract: This article presents Peter Railton's analysis of scientific explanation and discusses its application in historiography. Although Railton thinks covering laws are basic in explanation, his account is far removed from Hempel. The main feature of Railton's account is its ecumenism. The "ideal explanatory text," a central concept in Railton's analysis, has room for not only causal and intentional, but also structural and functional explanations. The essay shows this by analyzing a number of explanations in history. In Railton's terminology all information that reduces our insecurity as to what the explanandum is due is explanatory. In the "encyclopedic ideal explanatory text," different kinds of explanation converge in the explanandum from different starting points. By incorporating pragmatic aspects, Railton's account is well suited to show how explanations in historiography can be explanatory despite their lack of covering laws or tendency statements. Railton's account is also dynamic, showing how the explanatory quest is a never-ending search for better illumination of the ideal explanatory text. Railton's analysis is briefly compared to, and found compatible with, views on explanation presented by David Lewis, C. Behan McCullagh, and R. G. Collingwood. Confronted with Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics and Donald Davidson's insistence on the indeterminacy of interpretation, the essay suggests that the objectivity of the ideal explanatory text should be regarded as local, limited to the description under which the action is seen.<br>

Author(s): Felman François<br>
Abstract: Dans ce plaidoyer argumenté en faveur de l'histoire du temps présent, François Bédarida lève une à une les objections faites à ce champ historiographique regardé, quelquefois encore, avec suspicion. Cette notion de temps présent est définie dans une mise en perspective avec le passé et l'avenir. En définitive, l'historien, confronté à la mémoire immédiate des témoins, trouve dans le temps proche un terrain à la fois fragile et fécond. Depuis une vingtaine d'années, l'histoire du temps présent contribue au renouvellement du champ historiographique, tant par le regard qu'elle permet d'offrir sur la notion d'historicité que par la mise en œuvre de pratiques particulières. Les objections formulées à son égard sont cependant nombreuses: absence de recul, manque ou, au contraire, surabondance des sources, incomplétude de l'objet, flou sur la définition même du champ d'études. Or l'intérêt de l'étude du très contemporain réside justement dans la complexité des liens que le présent entretient avec le passé et l'avenir: un temps présent qui fait figure de trait d'union entre ces différentes temporalités à l'image d'un passeur ou d'un traducteur. Mais bâtir une histoire du temps récent ne consiste pas à faire œuvre de mémoire: si l'historien se nourrit des témoignages de ses contemporains, il exerce son regard critique sur eux et, tâche tout à fait inconfortable, fait œuvre d'explication en fonction d'un présent dont il est à la fois l'acteur et l'interprète. /// Over the last twenty years, the history of the present has renewed historiography through the vision it provides on the notion of historicity as well as by the implementation of particular practices. But there are many objections to it: a lack of distance; either a lack of or too many sources; the lack of completion of the object, blurriness about the very definition of the field of study. Nevertheless, the author suggests that the interest in the study of the contemporary dwells in the complexity of the links the pr~<br>

Abstract: This article evaluates Emmanuel Levinas's novel "ethical metaphysics" of interpersonal relations from a religious perspective. Levinas presents a unique version of agape ethics that can be evaluated in terms of a number of the dilemmas that have traditionally attended Christian discussions of neighbor-love. Because Levinas's analysis makes our responsibility for other persons depend on their eschatological significance, it has the same problems that hamper all theories of neighbor-love that lack a sufficient role for reciprocity.<br>

Author(s): Fabris Adriano<br>
Abstract: No presente ensaio trata-se da relação entre filosofia e cristianismo no século XX a partir da consideração de uma problemática comum a estas experiências: o eclipse do sentido, ou seja, a perda de referênda a um horizonte a partir do qual o ser humano pode orientar-se na vida. Esta problemática, diferentemente declinada nas formas do excesso do mal, do niilismo e da indiferença religiosa, é uma das heranças com que hoje tanto a filosofia como o cristianismo têrn de se debater. O presente artigo reconstrói uma "genealogia filosófica" da atitude de indiferença e oferece deste fenómeno uma análise articulada. A partir daqui apresentam-se duas soluçõoes possíveis, capazes de unir ainda filosofia e cristianismo e que estão em posição defavorecer novas formas de co-implicação entre Deus, homem e mundo: a referênda aos aspectos "positivos" da indiferença e a atenção à esfera do emocional, na qual as motivações têrn ainda espaço. /// The present essay deals with the relation between philosophy and Christianity in the 20 th Century in relation to the eclipse of meaning, i. e., the lack of a horizon that constitutes a point of reference by which one might orient his/her life. This problematic, affected differently by excesses of evil, nihilism, and religious indifference in the last century, is at the heart of the debate. In view of this, the present article offers a "philosophical genealogy" of the attitude of indifference. On the basis of an analysis of this phenomenon, it proposes two possible solutions that might bring philosophy and Christianity together by reformulating the ways that God, man, and the world may be seen as co-implicated and by considering how this indifference can have positive aspects.<br>

Author(s): Maldamé Jean-Michel<br>
Abstract: The article aims at a demonstration of the various problems attached to the concordist project. The study begins with a definition of concordism, precisely in order to show that it is derived from the desire of assuring the unity of the human spirit as it is confronted with the great diversity of scientific knowledge, but also that it ends up contradicting this very intention due to its lack of a true spirit of criticism. The article shows also how during the xx! h century the crucial questions to which the concordism related have to do with those pertaining to the origin of the universe, to the formation of the planet earth and to the notion of original sin. However, due to the fact that this last point is, no doubt, the most delicate and sensible one, the article insists particularly on a more detailed analysis of the notion of original sin in a theological perspective, one namely that is coherent with contemporary scientific knowledge. /// O presente artigo tem por objectivo mostrar os impasses a que conduz a atitude concordista em relação aos dados da Ciência e da Teologia. Nesse sentido, o estudo começa por definir o que se entende por concordismo. Mostra-se até que ponto a intenção do concordismo é a de assegurar a unidade do espírito humano confrontado com a diversidade dos saberes, mas também até que ponto essa mesma intenção é traída pela notável ausência de um verdadeiro espírito crítico. Mostra-se também que ao longo do século XX os pontos mais salientes do concordismo têm a ver com as questões ligadas à origem do universo, à formação da terra e ao pecado original Dado, porém, que este último ponto é, sem dúvida, o mais delicado, o autor do artigo detém-se numa análise mais detalhada e situada da noção de pecado original numa perspectiva teológica renovada por virtude dos conhecimentos derivados das ciências naturais.<br>

Abstract: Le sujet est la construction identitaire des lesbiennes qui se perçoivent elles-mêmes comme masculines et qui sont ainsi perçues par leur entourage: par les lesbiennes aussi bien que par les autres personnes. Le "masculin" est envisagé comme une création dans et par la hiérarchie de genre.L'au teure a mené pendant un an une enquête dans une discothèque; 19 histoires de vie apportent leur témoignage. Au terme de ses recherches, la masculinité en question apparaît: 1) comme une manière supportable d'être une femme pour celles qui ne sereconnaissent pas dans le stéréotype féminin; 2) comme un "paysage", c'est-àdire comme quelque chose dontlalesbienne trouve les traits dans le système de genres de la société et dont elle s'empare, faute de mieux ou d'autre chose, pour manifester son refus de la position genrée à quoi la société l'assigne. This article is about the construction of identity among lesbians who perceive themselves and are perceived as "masculine" by others, including other lesbians. The "masculine" is seen by the author as a construction of the gender hierarchy. The author has conducted interviews for a year in a bar and has collected 19 life-stories.Her findings show that the masculinity attributed to lesbians is: 1) a way of making tolerable the fact of being a woman for those women who do not accept the feminine stereotypes; 2) a landscape: an environment made up by lesbians with elements they find in society's gender system, for lack of alternative models, and which they use to express their refusal of the gendered position society wants to assign them.<br>

Author(s): VERMEULEN E. E. G.<br>
Abstract: It would seem to the purpose here to consider the Dutch historian Johan Huizinga in his relation to his fellow-historians, Robert Fruin and Jan Romein. For in this trio Huizinga contrasted with Fruin, and in his turn Romein contrasted with Huizinga, whereas, on the other hand, in spite of their different view-points, they are at the same time connected by the plainly unbroken line of liberal adogmatism. Fruin the father of Dutch historiography, was original in his liberal adogmatism. Not a single thesis, according to him, is to be carried into safety beforehand and exempted from investigation. Nothing is to be held up for acceptance without permission for examination. In demanding such blind acceptance one would be guilty of moral constraint and mental repression, a fault according to him especially committed by the Roman Catholic Church. In the long run this liberal and adogmatic inspiration of Fruin's came to run dry. With him the devices and the technique of research became ends in themselves. Fruin rationalized this development in the thesis that the disinterestedness with which we ought to strive after the truth would be tarnished if we were to expect from scholarly historical research any contribution whatsoever to the existential unfolding of the investigating subject. Huizinga's views on the theory of history constitute a violent reaction to this view. He argues that owing to the historian's selection of his material, as well as by the ideas through which the historian comprehends the historical process, subjectivity is unavoidable. Moreover, it is desirable. It is unscholariy, Huizinga says, to assume without evidence that the purification the subject desires to undergo by his adogmatic stand, should presuppose complete elimination—impossible in itself—of any subjective element whatsoever. The idea of objectivity, he says, should be broadened from a non-subjective objectivity, without evidence too narrowly conceived, per se unattainable, into an objectivity~<br>

Abstract: Cet article propose d'explorer les enjeux d'une écriture romanesque contemporaine définie comme douleur fantôme de l'histoire et exercice de ses mémoires possibles: deux séries complémentaires d'exemples – liées pour l'une à la réinvention d'une mémoire du bourreau par un narrateur « sosie » de l'historien (Manuel Vázquez Montalbán et Jonathan Littell), et pour l'autre à la saisie de l'historicité des temps présents sous l'angle conjoint de la mélancolie et de l'ironie (David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon et Dubravka Ugrešić) – permettent d'éclairer l'ambition romanesque de transcription de l'histoire dans l'exercice « à-présent » (ou « au temps-maintenant » , selon l'expression de Walter Benjamin) de ses mémoires possibles. En courant le risque d'une rivalité ou d'une confusion trompeuse entre les statuts du discours historiographique et du récit romanesque, et en s'exposant à la récusation par le lecteur de sa légitimité en la matière, le roman contemporain choisit de s'établir dans les plis du savoir historien et ainsi d'engager ses moyens propres dans l'entreprise d'une écriture en palimpseste du texte virtuel, ou idéal, de l'expérience historique. This article sets out to investigate those aspects of the contemporary novel in which fiction writing delves into the ghost pains of history and experiments with its would-be memories. Two sets of complementary examples will allow us to shed light on this particular novelistic ambition, i.e. transcribing history into a "to-day" (or "now-time", to use a phrase coined by Walter Benjamin) experimentation with its virtual memories. The first set of texts (by Manuel Vázquez Montalbán and Jonathan Littell) illustrates the reinvention of the executioner's memory courtesy of a narrator passing himself for a double of the historian. The second series of novels (by David Albahari, Aleksandar Hemon and Dubravka Ugrešić) features several attempts to grasp the historical quality of present times at the articulation of melancholy and ~<br>

Abstract: Divers ouvrages sur saint Augustin conduisent à reposer la question du temps et celle du sujet qui ont alors été réunies pour la première fois comme un unique problème : memoria, conscience et conscience de soi, sont pensées selon le temps comme un sentir primordial. Celui-ci suppose un lieu, le ciel des ciels, qui est le lieu temporel de l'homme auprès de Dieu. L'intériorité augustinienne a des antécédents dans la pensée antique ; elle a influencé la philosophie récente ; Heidegger interprète l'ego de Descartes d'une façon augustinienne dans son herméneutique de la facticité. Les questions suscitées par ces ouvrages viennent du manque actuel d'une histoire spéculative de l'ego, en même temps que d'une résurgence évidente de celui-ci dans le champ de la philosophie contemporaine. Several books about Augustine lead to question once more the topic of time and of the subject which then were united for the first time as a single problem : memoria, conscionsness and self conscionsness are thought according to time as a prime feeling. The latter supposes a place, heaven in heaven, which is the temporal seat of man next to God. Augustinian interiority has its antecedents within classical thought. It influenced recent philosophy. Heidegger interprets Descartes' ego in an Augustinian way within his hermeneutics of facticity. The topics at stake from these books surge from the present lack of a speculative history of the ego, together with an obvious resurgence of the latter within the field of contemporary philosophy.<br>

Abstract: Le premier volume d'inédits de Levinas comprend un hommage à Bergson rédigé en 1946. Levinas voit en Bergson celui qui s'est opposé au temps de la science et des machines au nom du temps vécu ; ceci a rendu possible la conception heideggérienne du temps comme être. Levinas souscrit à la grande découverte de Bergson. Il souligne l'intérêt de la critique bergsonienne du néant comme être biffé, mais rejette la critique du désordre qui ne serait qu'un ordre différent ; pour lui, le désordre est le chaos préalable à tout ordre. Surtout, il voit dans la durée un temps fondamental, une diachronie première, qui rend possibles les trois dimensions du temps. Et il note que la durée est une vie que la mort ne limite pas ; le temps n'est pas la marque de notre finitude. Pour Bergson, seule la matière meurt, par manque d'énergie. Bien qu'il n'ait pas suivi la méthode bergsonienne, Levinas reconnaît la supériorité de l'analyse de la durée et la prolonge dans le sens d'un immémorial subjectif. The first volume of Levinas' unpublished texts includes a tribute paid to Bergson in 1946. Levinas considers Bergson as the philosopher who opposed the time of science and machines in the name of time experienced, and this in turn paved the way to Heidegger's concept of time as being. Levinas subscribes to that major insight of Bergson. He underlines the interest of Bergson's criticism of nothingness as « being scratched out », but rejects his criticism of disorder as but a different kind of order. For Levinas, disorder is the chaos preliminary to any kind of order. Above all, he sees in duration a fundamental time, a primary diachrony which makes possible the three dimensions of time. He remarks that duration is life not limited by death: time is not the mark of our finitude. For Bergson, matter alone dies, for lack of energy. While he does not follow Bergson's method, Levinas acknowledges the superiority of his analysis of duration and takes it further in the direction of immemorial subjec~<br>

Abstract: Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ("all different, all equals"). It has generated a political ideology supporting an inclusive citizenship towards "different" cultures. After being adopted as official policy in many Countries, multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of the public sphere, when the different cultures express cultural values radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approa~<br>

Issue: i384292<br>

Author(s): Whyte Jack<br>
Abstract: In a variety of ways, all ethnographies are politically cast and policy relevant. Each of three recurrent political rhetorics is related to a unique set of fieldwork practices. Ethnographies that report holistically on journeys to "the other side" build policy/political significance by contesting popular stereotypes. Theoretical ethnographies draw on political imagination to fill in for a lack of variation in participant observation data and to model an area of social life without attempting to rule out alternative explanations. Comparative analytic studies build political relevance by revealing social forces that are hidden by local cultures. Each of these three genres of ethnographic methodology faces unique challenges in relating fieldwork data to politically significant explanations. By shaping the ethnographers relations to subjects and readers, each methodology also structures a distinctive class identity for the researchers-as worker, as aristocrat, or as bourgeois professional.<br>

Abstract: This essay treats Carole Maso's novel Defiance as an instance of feminist "anti-narrative." Toward this end, it considers the novel's use of direct address, its formal and thematic silences, and its parody of narrative convention. It reflects on the lack of scholarship on the novel and situates it in the context of Maso's nonfiction to argue that it might be understood as a piece of feminist narratology.<br>

Abstract: The present research investigates the relationship between anxiety and the religiosity dimensions that Wulff (Psychology of religion: classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1991; Psychology of religion. Classic and contemporary views, Wiley, New York, 1997; Psychologia religii. Klasyczna i wspotczesna, Wydawnictwo Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, Warszawa, 1999) described as Exclusion vs. Inclusion of Transcendence and Literal vs. Symbolic. The researchers used the Post-Critical Belief scale (Hutsebaut in J Empir Theol 9(2): 48-66, 1996; J Empir Theol 10(1): 39-54, 1997) to measure Wulff's religiosity dimensions and the IPAT scale (Krug et al. 1967) to measure anxiety. Results from an adult sample (N = 83) suggest that three dimensions show significant relations with anxiety. Orthodoxy correlated negatively with suspiciousness (L) and positively with guilt proneness (O) factor—in the whole sample. Among women, Historical Relativism negatively correlated with suspiciousness (L), lack of integration (Q3), general anxiety and covert anxiety. Among men, Historical Relativism positively correlated with tension (Q4) and emotional instability (C), general anxiety, covert anxiety and overt anxiety. External Critique was correlated with suspiciousness (L) by men.<br>

Abstract: Critics have pointed out that in many contemporary cities wasteful modes of consumption, encouraged and facilitated by fantastic developments in technology, have significantly eroded the values of the traditional urban environment. Contemporary cities very often lack the sense of placeness, vibrant public life, and harmonious relationship between man and nature characteristic of the traditional urban environment. This article studies how the configuration of the physical boundary may be used as an important tool to reconstitute these values in contemporary cities. It suggests that the boundary is more than an abstract pattern of lines. Rather, it is integral to life within the city, and should possess greater significance in the design of the built environment.<br>

Abstract: La época que nos ha tocado vivir, que, a falta de mejores términos, denominamos tentativamente "globalización," provoca el entretejido de una malla virtual que aglutina privilegiadas zonas de contacto e ignorados ghettos de exclusión, así como irreconciliables identidades monolíticas y múltiples (individuales, locales, étnicas, religiosas, de género, de preferencias sexuales, nacionales, mundiales... et al.); fragmentaciones, opacidades, pro-, proto-, pos-, antinaciones, transnaciones, translenguas, transculturas... La novela Rojo, amarillo y verde, del autor boliviano-quebequés-canadiense-planetario Alejandro Saravia, es representativa del titubeante imaginario planetario que comienza a perfilarse. Lejos de ser una apología celebratoria de la "aldea global," este multifacético imaginario propone un contrapeso dialógico al monólogo del pensamiento único que pretende imponernos el capitalismo globalizante. La période que nous vivons, que nous nommons provisoirement la "mondialisation" à défaut de meilleurs termes, provoque l'entre-tissage d'un réseau virtuel agglutinant des zones de contact privilégiées et des ghettos d'exclusion ignorés; des identités monolithiques et multiples irréconciliables (individuelles, locales, ethniques, religieuses, de genre, d'orientations sexuelles, nationales, mondiales... et al.); des fragmentations, des opacités, des pro-, proto-, post-, anti-nations, des trans-nations, des trans-langues, des trans-cultures... Le roman Rojo, amarillo y verde, de l'auteur bolivien-québécois-canadien-planétaire Alejandro Saravia, est représentatif du chancelant imaginaire planétaire qui commence à se profiler. Loin d'être une apologie célébratoire du "Village global," cet imaginaire aux mille visages propose un contrepoids dialogique au monologue de la pensée unique, celle que le capitalisme mondialisant essaie de nous imposer.

Article Title: Testifying Absence in the Era of Forensic Testimony<br>
Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media<br>

Author(s): Cyr Rachel E.<br>
Abstract: Commenting on the significance of his work at a mass grave in Vukovar, Croatia, 1993—1995, anthropologist Clyde Snow predicted that the application of forensic scientific methods in the documentation of mass atrocity would help prevent the future denial of atrocities. A couple of years later in nearby Kosovo, others would follow forensic scientific investigators only to report what they never saw or never found leading many commentators and tertiary witnesses to doubt that atrocities had occurred. As absence and lack arise against the backdrop of forensic discourse, we are called upon to weigh the stakes of negative evidence witnessing and its implications for cultural memory. This article contends that the semiotic and positional peculiarity of negative evidence in an era of forensic testimony has its analogue in the paschal figure of Jesus' empty tomb. Analyzing the rhetoric of denial that accompanied the forensic investigations of Kosovo in the late 1990s, the author suggests that the empty tomb is a paradigm that renders intelligible the interdiction implicitly placed on the forensic presencing of the body as well as the problematic with which memory is met in a world where forensic scientific testimony grows in importance.<br>

Abstract: The aim of this essay is to examine and go beyond the Freudian, psychoanalytical approach to the work of art. The author specifically considers the case of the musical work through the notion of 'repetition', a notion upon which the relationship of the unconscious with time is founded. After analyzing the ambiguity of the Freudian stance, he points out Freud's error regarding the meaning that can be attributed to repetition: according to Freud, repetition is only a negative phenomenon, which indicates the failure of desire fulfillment. The author instead posits that repetition, basic to all music, is the fundamental structure of a time-based art that is closely connected with the imaginary and the unconscious. Repetition and variation are the two fundamental aspects of the organization of time for the human psyche. The most ancient figure of repetition-variation in the unconscious is that of the echo. The author analyzes this notion through the concepts of 'sound-container of the Self' and 'transitional time' as defined by Anzieu and Winnicott. Several musical examples show how this figure lies at the root of the first experiences of musical time in Western culture. The echo can be considered as the basis of other musico-temporal figures such as 'dead time', the 'empty container', and the 'pseudo-connection'. These are the figures that constitute the temporal narrative of late nineteenth-century music, and of the passage to contemporary music, its fundamental discontinuity and non-linearity. Finally, the author returns to the initial topic: a psychoanalysis of a musical work can only be a psychoanalytic reading of the figures of its creation, it cannot be a psychoanalysis of the creating artist. More generally, what the work designates remains inaccessible - or rather, cannot be perceived except in a lack that returns us to the listener's emptiness. The work finds its place in the listener, bringing along an absence, a non-existence which is projected outwards, whic~<br>

Abstract: Hermeneutical theory remains rooted in a metaphysics of the "interiority of meaning". For example, Ricoeur transposed Freud's metaphysics of interior libidinal meaning into a literary theory of interpretation. The corollary to Freud's metaphysics of interiorized meaning is "desire as lack". Deleuze and Guattari's attack on Freud's theory of historical-libidinal drives formed the basis of their explication of the "rhizomatic" exteriority of meaning, which they develop, in literary terms, in their book, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature. In their view, Kafka's novels model a style of writing that disavows interior meaning. They also oppose the primacy of Freud's concept of desire-as-lack with that of desire-as-plenitude. This paper will discuss a mode of biblical interpretation based on the twin concepts of exteriority of meaning and desire-as-plentitude, according to four interpretive stategies: 1) rediscover one's hyperdifferentiated life; 2) think politically; 3) seek out interstitial spaces; 4) change one's point of entry.<br>

Abstract: Sob o pano de fundo da fenomenologia de Husserl acerca da ciência como conhecimento, os autores propōem uma análise da filosofia da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, em termos do que agora é referido como "estados da experimentação e da prática científica". Para este fim, é conceptualizada a pós-fenomenologia corno uma nova abordagem filosófica à tecnologia, examinando criticamente a análise da percepçāo de Merleau-Ponty. Posteriormente é apresentada uma concepçāo baseada no estudo das práticas em química, que exemplifica a crítica dos autores à necessidade, na teoria da percepção de Merleau-Ponty, da consideração dos mediadores tecnocientíficos. Como conclusão, tendo em conta as práticas tecnológicas e científicas, os autores defendem a utilidade do conceito de percepção na compreensão da geraçāo do conhecimento nas ciências experimentais e na tecnologia. Against the background of Husserl's phenomenology about science as knowledge, we propose an analysis of Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of perception in terms of what now is referred to as "studies of experimentation and scientific practices". To this end, we conceptualize post-phenomenology as a new philosophical approach to technology, and critically examine Merleau-Ponty's analysis of perception. We then present a conception based upon the study of practices in chemistry that substantiates our critique of the lack of consideration for technoscientific mediators in Merleau-Ponty's theory of perception. In conclusion, taking account of technological and scientific practices, we argue for the concept's usefulness in understanding knowledge generation in experimental sciences and technology.<br>

Abstract: Desire, as Martin Hägglund claims in
         Dying For Time, has been erringly conceived in philosophical, literary, and psychoanalytic traditions as testifying to a fundamental lack of being. In response, Hägglund develops the notion of chronolibido, a theory that posits the constitutive difference of desire as testifying to temporal finitude and mortality as the object of desire. In the rubric of chronolibido, the desire for immortality dissimulates a preceding desire for survival. This review takes up Hägglund's theory of desire and examines the implications of chronolibido for reading modernist literature.<br>

Abstract: In
         Gatsby, chapters 1 to 4 have spontaneity, a stylistic directness that seduces the reader into thehappinesselement of nostalgia. The aura of mystery, the uncertainty about the characters, the romantic lyricism, and the narrative coherence transfer the reader to the summer of 1922 in a way that turns this summer not only into Nick's memory, but also into the reader's own textual memory. This, together with a more attentive reading in the beginning due to a lack of expectations, gives the earlier part of the text greater importance and increases the possibility of emotional inclusion (Perry 52–53).
               This is a never-ending party.5<br>

Abstract: In 1986, however, SPEP's present mission statement could not have been conceived. Many important issues and questions remained unrecognized or simply ignored. But the opening before the organization was now a “postmodern” one, and a hallmark of what is called postmodern thought is its requirement that it transform in the force of its own lack of founded stability. I believe that 1986 began a series of developments that is turning SPEP toward ways of thought and life that cannot be labeled postmodern. I doubt that this turning constitutes a midlife crisis for SPEP in its fiftieth year. But it does highlight for me the fact that I have been giving a historical narrative that has to do with continuities in the dissolution of continuities, that I have not been—if I may put it this way—postmodern in an orthodox manner, although I have refused to give an unambiguous meaning to the term that has played a major role in organizing this essay. I do not know whether this discussion is postmodern, post-postmodern, or modern, and I do not care. I do care, however, about the openings that SPEP has provided for collegiality, conflict, unresolved differences, transformations, and sites for presentations, discussion, and critique. In my experience, in its own organizational development and travail, it has occasioned changes in the lives of many philosophers (mine among them). I expect that its indeterminate opening now—its continuing transformations in the interaction of many differences—will continue to surprise, irritate, and change those of us who participate in its opportunities. I close with a sense of beginning and an acknowledgment of the strangeness of the continuity that a series of beginnings provides: continuity without substance, continuity coming to pass.<br>

Bernet's article, “The Limits of Conceptual Thinking,” is a fascinating reflection that draws on a diverse range of thinkers from Spinoza and Kant to Husserl and Heidegger to Deleuze. The centerpiece of the article stages an illuminating conversation between Heidegger and Deleuze on the nature and limits of conceptual thinking. Bernet draws out some surprising similarities in Heidegger's and Deleuze's critiques of modern, representational thinking, which turn on its objectivism, its subjectivism, and its logicism. Bernet also draws some parallels between Deleuze and Guattari's notion of philosophy as the creation of concepts and Heidegger's late work on the task of philosophical thinking. Despite his trenchant critique of modern, representational forms of conceptual thinking, Deleuze does not turn away from conceptual thinking altogether but reinterprets it as a fundamentally creative process driven by the need to respond to certain problems. Heidegger, by contrast, tends toward a more totalizing critique of conceptual thinking, though his account of the way of thinking bears some affinities to Deleuze's understanding of philosophy as the creation of concepts. Bernet argues that what ultimately explains this difference is Heidegger's and Deleuze's very different readings of early modern philosophy, specifically, Heidegger's lack of appreciation for Spinoza's anti-Cartesian understanding of concepts.<br>

Abstract: Approaching Mark C. Taylor's
         copiaof a/theological discourse from a hyperbolic perspective, for example, reveals this movement of hyperbole well. Taylor, especially in his earlier work, reads the radical theology of Thomas J. J. Althizer through a postmodern lens, constructing his own hyperbolic and paradoxical a/theological arguments. Through the practice of excess as a mode of thought, he radically (de)constructs a hybridity of theology and un-theology while tracing excessive, exaggerated concepts, for instance, the “not,” “erring,” the “Divine Milieu,” or “altar-ity,” along the disorienting margins of (un)thought that “mark” the openings within discourse, where an astonishing (re)apprehension may be gleaned. Taylor's most effective option in his attempt to write “beyond the end of theology,” which reveals the lack of language that is “inscribed in and as the failure of words” (1990, 223), is to write with/in this lack through the language of excess. Responding to the exigence of the current theological struggle with representation, methodology, and what he identifies as the end of theology, he argues through excess in order to communicate the magnitude of his subject matter.<br>

Article Title: “Reading the Past against the Grain: The Shape of Memory Studies.”<br>

Abstract: I turn to Ricoeur's work first because of its resonances with rhetorical studies. Scholars such as Michael Leff, Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, and Barbara Warnick have productively engaged some of these common themes, but there has not been a sustained effort to use his insights in rhetorical analysis generally, let alone in the rhetorical analysis of memory (Hauser
         1999; Leff1987and2003; Ritivoi2006; Warnick1987).
               This lack of attention may result in part from Ricoeur's own ambivalence toward rhetoric, which he once described as “philosophy's oldest enemy and its oldest ally” (1977, 10). Although Ricoeur maintained a rather narrow view of rhetoric, his preoccupation with its themes suggests that scholars of rhetoric can discover ideas in his work that can be developed into tools for critical analysis. Therefore, this article intends to contribute to a broader—albeit currently only intermittent—effort to assess the resonances between Ricoeur's work and the rhetorical tradition and to fashion useful tools from those mutual concerns.1<br>

Abstract: In addition, Ricoeur believes that a purely deontological framework like Kant's is insufficiently sensitive to the asymmetry inherent in human action. Humans not only do evil, they also suffer evil at the hands of others, and disproportionately so when they are the innocent victims of ignominious power. Much to our regret, the powerful few can bring whole peoples and nations to their knees, or very nearly annihilate them altogether, if they are fanatics and lack restraint. Precisely because others may be the non-consenting recipients of our actions, Ricoeur argues, we ought to treat them with the same solicitude we treat ourselves. And we should do so graciously, he adds, not with the expectation of receiving something of equal or greater value in return, but out of a sense of gratitude for the plenitude that has been given us. Hence, for Ricoeur, the primary concern of ethics is less about honoring rigid rules and more about taking responsibility for the welfare of others. Under the aegis of the good, decency obliges us first and foremost to minimize violence against the person, in all it nefarious forms, so that we can then maximize human flourishing across the globe—all of which brings Ricoeur well within the orbit of Shaw, who shares the same priorities and whose ethics is similarly teleological.<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Rhetorical Function of Utopia:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2012<br>
Abstract: An obvious criticism of Burke's idea of rhetorical transcendence is that it is utopian in the unrealistic sense. It seems so abstract in its focus on generalized terminology and images that it may have no possible concrete object. Burke realized this utopian quality reminiscent of the lack of actualized topos in More's utopian “no-place.” As rhetorician James Zappen explains, “These acts of pure persuasion are devoid of partisan advantage-seeking but also devoid of persuasive purpose. As such, they might not even exist.”
      
               The important thing to take away from Burke's ramblings, though, is the humanistic sense that the search for perfection is inherent in human nature and that understanding this utopian impulse can only help us to live and to seek happiness in a world of competing power and advantage: “Let us observe, all about us, forever goading us, though it be in fragments, the motive that attains its ultimate identification in the thought, not of the universal holocaust, but of the universal order…. [E]ach kind strives toward the perfection of its kind, and so toward the kind next above it, while the strivings of the entire series head in God as the beloved cynosure and ninecure, the end of all desire.”35
            
               By36
            GodBurke means an ultimate ideal transcending all other symbols and fulfilling all desire—the kind of nirvana that would eliminate the need for further utopia-making altogether. This, of course, is not achievable in the course of history, but the mythic experience of it would activate a downward movement in the process, bringing the transcendent ideals back into the pragmatic world of discourse and human affairs. This would be the function of utopia in Burkean terms, and it would result in a habit of mind that would amount to a large-scale educational scheme—dare I say, the education of desires. If the young were informed of the dialectical-rhetorical process of transcendence from the beginning, ~<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Meta-Utopian Metatext:<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.23.2.issue-2<br>

Abstract: The nation is a shifting concept, an ideological construct, a master signifier whose function is to maintain or to bring into being its own referent. “A nation is the same people living in the same place,” says Leopold Bloom—“or also living in different places.”
         
               In these terms a nation is the historical alibi for the incoherence of geography: it is the invention of an identity and a rationale for a place or population without a predetermined identity or rationale. The nation of the epic is as such the diametric opposite of the Utopian space, a dreamscape that invokes a radical rationalization of the body politic5
            withoutactual people or place. Utopianism's mythic delineations reveal historical nationhood's own lack of definability and suggest that such teleological definition may be incompatible with historical materiality. If, after all, Utopianism is a manifesto, then it is one of the imagination, one without contemporary or coterminous manifestation. Utopianism exposes the indeterminacy of nationhood, an immanent uncertainty that echoes the theories of Werner Heisenberg or, for that matter, of James Joyce. In the work of James Joyce, that avatar of ambiguity, we find, as Wicht writes, that “national identity is created by the discriminating reinterpretation and refashioning of selected historical data and cultural discourses”
               —nationhood is not an absolute but a fluid and culturally subjective mode of positioning.6<br>

Journal Title: Utopian Studies<br>
Article Title: The Problematic of Architecture and Utopia<br>
Publisher: Pennsylvania State University Press<br>
Issue: utopianstudies.25.1.issue-1<br>
Date: 4 1, 2014<br>
Abstract: Although modern architecture's association with Utopia could seem self-evident, considerations of architecture and Utopia from within the discipline and by utopian studies scholars are beset by a troubling lack of precision in defining the utopian dimensions of architecture and urbanism or how either might actually benefit from encounters with Utopia. If this assertion is accepted, any meaningful recuperation of Utopia for architecture
         mustbegin with clarifying what this might actually offer. In most circles, including architecture and utopian studies, visual representations of novel forms (and on occasion their construction) have been enough to designate individual works of architecture and city plans as utopian. Arguably, an unwillingness to risk strong declarations as to what makes works of architecture utopian—beyond newness—ensures that Utopia will remain an apparent irrelevance in discussions of architecture. By the same token, in the absence of definition, conventional readings of orthodox modern architecture as utopian, and as having actually attempted to give form to Utopia in its heyday, will persist. Because the preponderantly negative reading of modern architecture as utopian largely derives from profound dissatisfaction with the real failures of twentieth-century architecture to produce a humane city, Utopia has become a damning myth for architects and the public alike, even though the overconfident inventors of the modern city rarely if ever asserted Utopia as their aim.

Journal Title: Science Fiction Studies<br>
Article Title: “Terminus.”<br>
Publisher: Johns Hopkins UP<br>
Issue: sciefictstud.41.issue-1<br>
Date: 3 1, 1973<br>
Abstract: This essay examines the role of agency and metatextuality in Élisabeth Vonarburg's B
         ridgeCycle, comprised mainly of a group of short stories originally published between 1977 and 2002 and then revised in their definitive French versions for the collectionLe Jeu des coquilles de nautilus(2003). The cycle's main storyline involves the uncertain journey between parallel worlds by a series of recurring characters. Three intimately linked narrative components—each closely related to certain protocols of reading fiction and of particular interest to science fiction—form the theoretical and analytical bases of this study: the three recurring topoï of the protagonist-Voyager's travels; character agency that in part drives the sense of these realms and their occupation; and the dénouement which gives a certain meaning and closure to the spaces in their diverse manifestations and to the characters who pursue their quests in these spaces. Vonarburg's narratives place their protagonists in a situation precisely similar to that of the reader as she must negotiate the trans-world context, come to grips with her own relative lack of agency, and at the same time seek some level of control through knowledge. Suchmise en abymeallows the author, through the choice of dénouement, to comment on the manner in which this universe and the real one are imagined, represented, and decoded, and on how meaning is conveyed.<br>
